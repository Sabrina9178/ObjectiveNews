NBC_1,"Kari Lake wins Arizona GOP Senate primary, setting up a key race against Democrat Ruben Gallego",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kari-lake-wins-arizona-gop-senate-primary-ruben-gallego-rcna164043,2024-07-31 13:35:02.778514,,"PHOENIX — Kari Lake won the Republican Senate primary in Arizona, NBC News projects, officially setting up a critical matchup against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. 
Lake, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, was running ahead of Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb 54% to 40% with roughly 82% of the expected vote in. Former news anchor Elizabeth Reye placed a distant third. 
Lake advances to the general election for the seat being vacated by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema against Gallego, a Phoenix-area House member and Marine veteran who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. The race in battleground Arizona will be among a handful that determine partisan control of the Senate this fall. 
""This is not a battle between Democrats and Republicans. This is a battle between good and evil,"" Lake said at her election night event. ""This is a battle between the people who want to destroy this country and the people who want to save America.""
Lake, 54, a former newscaster, first emerged on the political scene during her unsuccessful run for governor in 2022 as a prominent promoter of Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. She later refused to accept her own loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs, who is now Arizona’s governor. 
Lake has heavily touted Trump’s endorsement again during her Senate campaign. She arrived at her polling location in Paradise Valley earlier Tuesday in a new tour bus that featured a giant decal of her with Trump and the words “Endorsed by President Trump.”
“Knowing that I’m Trump-endorsed is important to a lot of people here in Arizona,” Lake said.
Lake’s challenge will now take her MAGA-themed message to a broader electorate in a critical swing state for both the race for the White House and control of the Senate. Democrats hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate.
Gallego, 44, once a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has played up his willingness to work across the aisle as he seeks statewide office. 
“In the 554 days since we launched this campaign, Arizonans in every corner of the state have made clear that they want a U.S. Senator who can bring people together to defend abortion rights, cut costs for families, protect our water future, and take care of our veterans — and that’s exactly what I intend to do,” Gallego said in a statement Tuesday night. 
Gallego enters the general election stage of the race with a cash advantage: He had $8.2 million in his campaign account compared to $2.1 million for Lake as of July 10. 
Arizona also hosted notable House primaries, several of which remained uncalled late Tuesday night. 
Freshman GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani fended off a primary challenger in the swing 6th District, setting up a rematch with former state Sen. Kirsten Engel, a Democrat. 
Engel, who ran uncontested in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, lost to Ciscomani two years ago by less than 2 percentage points. The race for the seat — which covers a large chunk of the southeastern part of the state, including Tucson — is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. 
In another battleground, the 6th District, a crowded field of Democrats were vying to take on GOP Rep. David Schweikert. 
In the 8th District, former Maricopa County prosecutor Abe Hamadeh, financier Blake Masters and state House Speaker Ben Toma were locked in a tight race for the Republican primary. 
Hamadeh and Masters, 2020 election deniers who both ran unsuccessfully for statewide office two years ago, both had support from Trump. The winner of the primary will be a heavy favorite in the general election to replace retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko. 
And in the 3rd District, the seat Gallego is vacating to run for Senate, former Phoenix City Council member Yassamin Ansari and former state Democratic Party chair Raquel Terán were battling in the Democratic primary.
Further down the ballot, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who has forcefully pushed back against unfounded election fraud claims, was in a close race with state Rep. Justin Heap. The outcome could have a major impact on how elections are administered in the country's largest battleground county. Alex Tabet is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.

NBC_2,"Ashley Benefield, ex-ballerina who claimed self-defense in estranged husband's killing, found guilty of manslaughter",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-swan-murder-trial-ashley-benefield-verdict-rcna164411,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"A former ballerina charged in the fatal shooting of her husband was convicted of manslaughter late Tuesday in Florida, hours after a jury began considering her claim that the shooting four years ago was in self-defense.
Ashley Benefield, 33, had been charged with second-degree murder, but the panel convicted her of the lesser crime in the killing of Doug Benefield on Sept. 27, 2020.
After the verdict was announced, the judge revoked Benefield's $100,000 bond and remanded her to the custody of the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. A date has not been set for her sentencing.
Benefield testified last week that she feared for her life when she fatally shot her husband during what she described as a terrifying confrontation with him at her home south of Tampa.
Prosecutors challenged her account, saying evidence from the day of the killing did not match her description of the confrontation and accusing her of using “unfounded” allegations of domestic abuse to obtain sole custody of their child.
“She did not have to shoot him,” Suzanne O’Donnell, assistant state attorney for Florida’s 12th Judicial District, said in her closing argument Tuesday. “She had an agenda. She got what she wanted.”
Benefield’s lawyer, Neil Taylor, said his client had repeatedly sought — but did not receive — help over what he described as her husband's abusive behavior, which culminated in an argument over a forthcoming move out of state that Ashley Benefield said turned physical, then lethal.
In emotional testimony last week, she testified that Doug Benefield blocked her from leaving her home, struck her in the face and lunged at her while she had her gun drawn and was pleading with him to stop.
In his closing argument Tuesday, Taylor said his client did what any law-abiding citizen can be expected to do with an abusive partner: She filed ""complaint after complaint after complaint calling Doug Benefield’s behavior to the attention of authorities with no results. Over and over again with no relief."" 
No one else was in the home when she fatally shot her husband, nor was there video of the confrontation. But O’Donnell said there was no evidence that Benefield had been struck in the face, and she described her testimony about the event as “evasive.”
O’Donnell also said the fatal bullet that struck the victim traveled side to side through his body, appearing to contradict Benefield's testimony that he was advancing on her when she pulled the trigger.
She testified that her husband was controlling and volatile. She alleged that he fired a bullet into the ceiling of their home during an argument in which he threatened suicide, that he threw a loaded gun at her and that he punched their dog in the face so hard it knocked the animal unconscious. 
In 2017, the Benefields obtained a court order in South Carolina — where they had lived together — that barred them from contacting each other, O’Donnell said. 
After Doug Benefield appeared to have violated the order, Taylor said, his wife sought a domestic violence injunction in Florida, where she had moved.
The injunction, which cited the allegations Ashley Benefield described at trial, would have barred her estranged husband from seeing their child. The injunction was denied when a judge said she did not find her claims credible. Taylor presented text messages between the estranged couple at trial that he said corroborated his client’s account.
O'Donnell said Tuesday that prosecutors weren't trying to convince the jury ""that Doug Benefield was an angel."" But the killing accomplished something that O'Donnell said Ashley Benefield had sought: sole custody of their daughter.
“This was a custody battle that this mother was going to win at all costs,” O’Donnell said in her opening statement. “The cost was the life of Doug Benefield, and that is murder.”  Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_3,Triathletes will swim in Seine as last-minute testing shows the river is safe,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/triathletes-will-swim-seine-last-minute-testing-shows-river-safe-rcna164401,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"After months of speculation about whether the Seine River would be clean enough for Olympic athletes to compete in it, officials deemed the water safe for swimming after a last-minute test.
The favorable test of the river’s water quality on Wednesday morning Paris time means the men and women will swim in back-to-back races as part of the triathlon, beginning at 8 a.m. local time. The men’s race had originally been scheduled for Tuesday, but it was postponed after the Seine failed water quality tests.  
“The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3:20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,” said a news release from Paris organizers and World Triathlon, the sport’s governing body.  
Water quality in the Seine became something of a saga leading up to the Games, as organizers raced to prepare the polluted waterway for prime-time attention. For months, the French have been testing river samples for E. coli and Enterococci bacteria, which are indicators of fecal matter, as well as other pathogens. When E. coli levels are high, swimmers risk developing gastrointestinal illness. 
The Seine had been failing those tests after rainy weather, because storms can send runoff, and sometimes sewage, into the river. 
Swimming had been disallowed on the Seine for more than a century because it was too polluted, but the city of Paris led a $1.5 billion effort to clean up the river and shore up waste treatment systems in the lead-up to the Olympics.
As the first events approached, organizers had hoped for clear, sunny weather to reduce overall pollution and allow ultraviolet light to inactivate some bacteria.  
But the weather has rarely cooperated. 
Last year, some test events to rehearse the triathlon were canceled because of water quality concerns after rainfall. 
Then the opening ceremony, which involved a boat parade on the Seine, took place amid some downpours Friday, and the showers lasted into Saturday. 
The rain caused pollution and forced organizers to cancel two days of swim training Sunday and Monday. Then they postponed the men’s triathlon, which was originally scheduled for Tuesday morning.
“I’m just trying to focus on what I can control,” Kirsten Kasper, an American triathlete, told NBC News on Tuesday. “We swim in a lot of city locations, and it’s common for water quality to be a question. But I just have to trust that the race organizers are doing the testing and what they need to do to make sure it’s safe.”
Water quality experts said the difficulties ensuring the Seine was sufficiently clean could draw needed attention to broader issues of environmental contamination, which are common worldwide.
“It’s just very hard to manage, in large cities, the amount of human waste that we see,” said Katy Graham, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech’s College of Engineering. “The public thinks a lot of these issues have been completely solved. They’re most certainly not.”

NBC_4,Border state hawk Mark Kelly as VP pick could help shield Harris on a major liability,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/border-state-hawk-mark-kelly-vp-pick-help-shield-harris-major-liabilit-rcna164104,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"WASHINGTON — Three months after he became a senator in 2021, Mark Kelly had a bone to pick with the Biden-Harris administration.
President Joe Biden had just given his first address to Congress, and Kelly, D-Ariz., accused him of failing to address “the immediate crisis at the border” and vowed to “continue holding this administration accountable” on the issue. At the time, the White House was reluctant to call it a crisis, siding with activists on the left who believed the word played into anti-immigration GOP rhetoric.
While he has been a Biden ally on most issues, Kelly remained a vocal critic on border security. He went after the White House for inadequately funding Arizona’s migrant programs and urged the administration not to reverse a Trump-era policy known as Title 42, which made it easier to turn away migrants at the U.S. border. When the White House revoked the policy anyway in 2022, Kelly called the decision “wrong” and “unacceptable” in a statement.
Two years later, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have recalibrated, issuing executive actions last month to crack down on migration. And Kelly is on the short list to be Harris’ running mate after Biden dropped his re-election bid.
“We’ve worked together on it in a very positive way. At times, there were disagreements,” Kelly told NBC News while praising “the steps that the administration has recently taken and the results that we have seen from it” in bringing down border crossings.
“The executive action that the president and vice president put into place has been a very positive thing,” Kelly said.
Kelly’s stature as a border-state senator who has held hawkish positions before it was popular in the party has led some Harris allies to see him as an ideal running mate who could help neutralize what may be her biggest political vulnerability. Former President Donald Trump has put immigration at the center of his case against her. And unlike other VP contenders, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kelly is the only one getting a serious look who lives in a state along the southern border and has been out front on the issue.
“Mark Kelly is the only candidate that does exactly what [Harris] needs to do. She needs to have legitimate credibility on border security. ... Kelly solves that and increases the share of the Latino vote,” said Mike Madrid, a former GOP operative who opposes Trump. “He can personalize it because he lives in a border state.”
“There’s a legitimacy by saying, ‘Yeah, the border is out of control, but it needs to be secured, too. You can do both without being racist or without being a bad person.’ And that’s what he does very elegantly,” Madrid said.
Even some pro-immigration activists see Kelly as a solid pick, citing his support for legal pathways to citizenship and his ability to blunt Republican attacks on Harris over the border.
“Sen. Kelly has proven experience and has knowledge of border security, and he also supports citizenship for Dreamers and long-term residents. His experience would help insulate the Harris administration from Republican attacks on immigration,” said Kerri Talbot, a former Senate Democratic counsel and executive director of the advocacy group Immigration Hub.
Some Republicans say picking Kelly wouldn’t fix Harris’s problems. 
“Smoke and mirrors,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is running to be the next GOP leader in the Senate.
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chair of the party’s campaign arm, said Democrats are “all complicit” in border policy failures.
Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., a co-author of a border security bill that Trump successfully pushed Republicans to kill, said he has worked more closely with Arizona’s other senator, independent Kyrsten Sinema, than with Kelly on the issue.
But other Republicans who have worked on immigration and asylum policy say Kelly has better instincts about it than Harris, who is still finding her footing on the issue as a presidential candidate.
“It’s too little too late on Biden and Harris’ part on the border. This is the one area where he has credibility,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said of Kelly. “The reason that he’s been outspoken is because he’s a border state senator and he’s seen it firsthand. ... I believe he has much better instincts.”
Now, Kelly is aligned with Harris on how to respond to Trump’s attacks on border policy: Attack him for blocking attempts to fix the problem and then use it as a political weapon. At a rally Tuesday in Atlanta, Harris went after Trump for sinking the bill, telling the crowd, “Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.”
Speaking with NBC News, Kelly cited the bipartisan bill that sought to raise the bar for asylum and trigger a border shutdown when migration patterns warranted it.
“We had comprehensive border security legislation, bipartisan stuff, something that doesn’t happen around here on this issue very often. It’s pretty rare. And then Donald Trump wanted this for the election. So my Republican colleagues ran away from it,” Kelly said. “It’s one of the worst things I’ve seen since I’ve been here in the United States Senate.”Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News."
NBC_5,What happened to Flavia Saraiva? Brazilian gymnast has bandage over eyebrow,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/happened-flavia-saraiva-brazilian-gymnast-bandage-eyebrow-rcna164419,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"Brazilian gymnast Flavia Saraiva showed off an eye-catching accessory during the women’s team gymnastics final at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday: a bandage over her eyebrow.
How did it happen?
Saraiva sustained the injury while warming up on the uneven bars. She took a fall, which left her with a cut above her right eye. In photos, her eyebrow appeared bloody and she seemed to have a black eye.
The 24-year-old gymnast received medical attention after the scary fall and reappeared with a bandage on her brow. 
“She left to get medical attention, but she is back,” NBC announcer Rich Lerner said during the broadcast. “She’s tough.”
“There is nothing worse than not just falling in warmups but blanking out and having that moment replay in your mind right before competing,” added analyst and Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez.
Once bandaged up, Saraiva performed her routine on the uneven bars, scoring a strong 13.666. She went on to performed a floor routine to a French cabaret classic. Saraiva’s teammate, Rebecca Andrade, is considered a friendly rival to Team USA’s Simone Biles.
Biles appeared to be dealing with an injury of her own at the event. She had strong performances throughout the day while wearing tape around her left shin and calf.
The superstar’s personal coach, Cecile Landi, said that Biles “felt a little pain in her calf” during her floor warmup a few days ago, but that pulling out of the competition was “never in [her] mind.”
After the USA men’s gymnastics team earned its first medal in 16 years Monday in Paris, the U.S. women’s team won the gold on Tuesday."
NBC_6,Vance discusses his rocky debut and what role he wants to play as Trump's VP,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/jd-vance-discusses-rocky-debut-role-wants-play-vp-rcna164295,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"RENO, Nev. — Sen. JD Vance knows he has had a rocky rollout as Donald Trump’s running mate, but he doesn’t believe he has disappointed the former president.
“No,” Vance, R-Ohio, said in an interview aboard his campaign plane en route to a rally here Tuesday. “I mean, I knew that when I came out of the gate there was going to be a couple of days of positive media coverage and then immediately they would go and attack me over everything that I had ever said in my life.”
Vance has faced relentless criticism from allies of Vice President Kamala Harris, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, for his 2021 comments questioning the societal value of women who don’t have children and referring to them as “childless cat ladies.” Harris’ campaign over the last week has tried to brand Vance and his political point of view as “weird.” Trump has stood by Vance.
“The price of entry of being on the national ticket and giving me an opportunity to govern is you have to ... take the shots, and so I sort of expected it,” Vance said. “I think that, frankly, the people who’ve made a lot of money and acquired a lot of power screwing the country up are not going to go easily.”
Vance is in the midst of a big Western swing that includes California fundraisers, traditional campaign rallies and a visit Thursday morning to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. With his wife, Usha, seated next to him at the front of their chartered 737, Trump Force Two, Vance discussed the early days of his vice presidential campaign, as well as what he hopes to accomplish if the GOP ticket wins this fall.
“My attitude is I want to be a good public servant,” Vance said when he was asked what particular policy areas he would carve out for himself. “I’ll help out wherever I’m asked to help out. Certainly, I’d love to be given some influence over our border policy, and I’d basically do the exact opposite of what Kamala Harris did.” 
This week’s trip is a bit of a reboot meant to sharpen Vance’s role as an attack dog against Harris, whom President Joe Biden endorsed as his successor when he ended his re-election bid days after Vance accepted the Republican nomination for vice president. While Harris backers have tried to define Vance as weird, Vance tried Tuesday to define Harris as weak — particularly on immigration and border security.
“It all starts with strength — strong borders, strong families, a strong economy and a strong president,” Vance said in an afternoon speech at a high school in Henderson, Nevada, near Las Vegas. “Of all of Kamala Harris’ faults, the worst of all is that she left America weak and vulnerable. The entire world now knows that she helped cover up Joe Biden’s declining mental capacity for years.”
“Our adversaries,” Vance added, “are licking their chops and the world is in disarray because of weak American leadership.”
Asked aboard his plane whether the weird vs. weak contrast was intentional, Vance described it as more of a coincidence.
“I wouldn’t say there’s some particular effort to tag her as weak,” he said. “If there’s a particular label we want the American people to be aware of, it’s that she’s an ultra-liberal.”
Aside from border issues, Vance said he could see himself in the Trump administration as a spokesperson on combating drug abuse. His mother, Beverly Aikins, is nearly 10 years sober after having battled addiction — a struggle he wrote about in his best-selling 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” and talked about in his speech at this month’s Republican National Convention. On the plane, Vance mentioned that he attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings with his mother “fairly frequently” to support her.
“One of the largest providers of medical care for people who have substance abuse disorder is Medicare,” Vance said. “And another big one is Medicaid, right? So the federal government has a huge role to play, I think, in solving or at least addressing the substance abuse problem. I think one of the roles that I can play is just a basic leadership role and remind people that there is hope on the other side of addiction — there is recovery.”
Vance then connected the issue back to a central issue in his recent speeches: the border.
“For people to get second chances, they have to not die when they’re at the bottom of the addiction crisis, and the best way to solve that problem is to prevent the worst poison from coming into our streets in the first place,” he said, blaming Mexican drug cartels. “And if there’s an attitude shift that I’ve seen over the last five years, the last three years, it’s that there’s so much fentanyl out there, and everything is laced with fentanyl, that the consequence of falling off the wagon could very well be death, right? There’s a sense of fear in the addiction recovery space that I didn’t notice five years ago.” 
Vance got enthusiastic receptions in Henderson and Reno. At the first stop, after he noted that he will turn 40 on Friday, the crowd broke into a rendition of “Happy Birthday.” He also has reinforcements on this trip. Jason Miller, a senior adviser on the Trump campaign, and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., were among those traveling with him Tuesday.
“I’m here today because of the nasty attacks on JD Vance claiming that he’s anti-woman,” Luna said from the stage in Henderson. “Can you believe that? This is, mind you, by the same party that can’t define what a woman is.”
Speaking with reporters afterward, Luna, who traveled on Vance’s plane, said no one asked her to make the trip. 
“It was actually me,” she said. “I was like, you know, I have some things to say. So I kind of invited myself. But they’re happy to have me.”
On the plane, Vance stood by his old comments about childless women, which at the time he applied specifically to Harris, a stepmother of two, and other Democrats. Vance also said at the time that the criticism didn’t extend to women who have trouble conceiving. 
“What I was criticizing and continue to criticize is a particular neurosis in American leadership that I think leads people to say crazy things, like you shouldn’t have children because climate change is a threat to the future,” Vance said Tuesday. “Climate change may very well be a problem, but it is not a problem that should motivate people to not have families. And I think that attitude is quite damaging. It’s quite destructive.
“I’ll keep on calling it out, even though I’m sure that Democrats will misrepresent what I say,” he added. “I just think that the substance of what I said is actually quite defensible.” 
Vance, who remarked last week that he was “pissed off” that he would no longer face Harris in a vice presidential debate, said he had no particular preference for a new opponent.
“I don’t really care,” Vance said. “I think that obviously different guys — and they’re all guys, I guess, except for [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer, but I don’t feel like she has a good chance — they all present different strengths and different weaknesses. My attitude is I have a job, but it’s to persuade as many people to vote for us as possible. And I’m going to have that same job whoever the Democrats nominate.” Henry J.

NBC_7,Harris officially has no challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-officially-no-challengers-democratic-nomination-rcna164267,2024-07-31 09:00:02.778514,,"Vice President Kamala Harris is officially the only candidate seeking the Democratic presidential nomination after a key deadline passed Tuesday evening with no one else qualifying.
According to the Democratic National Committee, 99% of delegates signed Harris' nominating petition.
With no internal competition, Democrats will avoid the messy fight that some party officials feared when President Joe Biden stepped aside in the race less than two weeks ago.
“Our Party has met this unprecedented moment with a transparent, democratic, and orderly process to unite behind a nominee with a proven record who will lead us in the fight ahead,” DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement Tuesday night.
Delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago will begin voting virtually to formalize Harris' nomination Thursday morning, sticking to the party's existing plan to finalize its nominee before an Aug. 7 ballot access deadline in Ohio. Harris' campaign has indicated she will select her vice presidential running mate before then, as well.
Democrats raced to rewrite their nominating rules after Biden dropped his re-election bid nine days ago, creating a lightning-fast nomination process that was open to anyone but was almost immediately seen as favoring Harris.
Any candidate who wanted to seek the nomination had until 6 p.m. ET Tuesday to secure the support of at least 300 delegates to qualify; Harris was the only candidate who did, according to the Democratic National Committee.
With virtually the entire party united behind Harris, the only candidates who declared their intentions to challenge her were a handful of unknown figures with no known support bases or funding.
Marianne Williamson, the self-help author who ran a long-shot Democratic presidential campaign in 2020, said she was planning to vie for the nomination at the Chicago convention but ultimately opted against throwing her name in the ring. She re-suspended her campaign Monday night.
""We did everything possible to stand for a blitz primary, an open convention and so forth. Yet the way the rules were made there truly was no way, Kamala’s momentum was in full swing, and all we could have done is create noise,"" Williamson wrote to supporters. ""I was in the race to create fundamental change, yes — but not as a chaos agent or metaphorical bomb thrower.""
Convention delegates will begin an unusual preconvention virtual roll call vote to ratify Harris as their top candidate. Voting will begin Thursday and continue for several days, according to the party's plans, with a ceremonial in-person roll call planned for the convention, as well.
Even though Democrats stripped so-called super delegates of much of their power a few years ago, they will be able to vote virtually for Harris, the DNC said, since Harris has  demonstrated that she has already secured an overwhelmingly majority support, meaning there's no chance of the super delegates changing the outcome.
Democrats had been planning to nominate Biden virtually since May, when they realized they would have an issue in Ohio. The state initially set its deadline for all parties to submit the names of their candidates before the Democratic National Convention, and it was slow to resolve the matter.
While Ohio election officials argued that Democrats do not need to take drastic measures like a preconvention virtual roll call, conservative groups have already signaled their intention to sue if Democrats miss the state's Aug. 7 deadline. Democrats say the party cannot risk litigation that could result in its losing its place on Ohio's ballot this fall.Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_8,Harris derides Trump on border security at Georgia rally as GOP presses the issue,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-derides-trump-border-security-georgia-rally-gop-presses-issue-rcna164207,2024-07-31 09:00:02.778514,,"ATLANTA — Vice President Kamala Harris, facing a new barrage of GOP attack ads seeking to define her early in her campaign, attacked back on immigration and border security before a fired-up crowd of thousands in an over-capacity arena Tuesday night.
Through chants of “Kamala” aimed at her and “lock him up” aimed at former President Donald Trump, Harris began her line of attack by citing her experience as attorney general of America’s largest border state, California.
“In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers,"" Harris said. ""I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.” 
“Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game on securing the border, but he does not walk the walk. Or as my friend Quavo says, he does not 'walk it like I talk it,'"" Harris said, referring to lyrics by the Atlanta rapper, who endorsed her moments earlier. 
Harris’ remarks were her sharpest effort yet to rebut Republican assertions that she lacks the will and experience to secure the border, that she failed to do so as vice president and that she would again be ineffective on the issue if she is elected president.
“This is America’s border czar, and she’s failed us. Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here,” the new Trump ad says of Harris. The narrator finishes by saying: “Kamala Harris. Failed, weak, dangerously liberal.”
Immigration and the border has been one of Trump's strongest issues throughout the election. Harris, holding her second rally as a presidential candidate after she took over from President Joe Biden this month, went on offense on immigration, bashing Trump for his role tanking a bipartisan bill that would have enacted tough reforms on the border, including a provision that would allow the president to shut it down if crossings hit a certain mark.
“Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill,” Harris said.
“It was all set to pass, but at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down. He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election,” she said to applause, before she concluded: “Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.”
She also needled Trump for waffling on a pledge to debate her. Trump now says he will wait until the Democratic ticket is finalized after the historic candidate switch this month.
“Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” Harris said, jeering at her opponent. “Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say ...”
Harris was emboldened by a crowd that ate up every word, including her condemnation of Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, as “plain weird.”
She spent little time actually urging voters to head to the polls in November — largely because she didn’t need to. The nearly 10,000 attendees in Atlanta, the campaign’s biggest crowd yet, were well aware of the job expected of them in November.
The crowd got energized by a coterie of Atlanta dance classics, from Soulja Boy’s ""Crank That"" to Usher’s ""Yeah!,"" as well as a performance by Grammy-winning artist Megan Thee Stallion, before some of Georgia’s most prominent Democrats urged them to replicate the record turnout that sent Biden to the White House and flipped the Senate in 2020. Speakers also took their own whacks at Trump, who was indicted last year on charges alleging a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results just blocks away at the Fulton County Courthouse.
“The American people are the jury, we’re going to get the verdict right, and we’re going to send Kamala Harris to the White House,” Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock said.
Rep. Nikema Williams, the chair of the state Democratic Party, said: “Not only is he still a loser in Georgia, but he’s also a 34-count convicted felon. I don’t know about y’all, but I’m ready to make him a loser again.”
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said: “Kamala Harris has proven that she’s prepared to prosecute the case against Donald Trump. Who better to take on a convicted felon than a prosecutor?”
By the time Harris took the stage, the crowd was bursting with energy.
“If you’ve never voted before, make sure you get out to vote, because this is a real one,” Quavo said.
The Harris campaign's Georgia office wrapped a weekend of events designed specifically to engage a base already enthusiastic about the woman at the top of the Democratic ticket.
Across Georgia, the campaign this weekend held more than 174 events, recruited thousands of new volunteers and opened three new field offices in an effort to boost its chances of keeping a state Biden won by the narrowest of margins in 2020.Nnamdi Egwuonwu is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed."
NBC_9,Wildfire smoke is probably harming your brain,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wildfire-smoke-hurts-brain-function-dementia-risk-rcna164062,2024-07-31 08:00:02.778514,,"Parts of California, Oregon and Montana are facing unhealthy levels of air pollution as several large fires blaze, including Northern California’s Park Fire, which has quickly ballooned into the fifth largest in the state’s history.
The smoke poses a hazard for people in the immediate vicinity and even some far away, as wildfire smoke can travel hundreds or thousands of miles.
The tiny particles in that smoke aren’t just bad for your lungs — a spate of studies over the last few years have found that it also negatively affects brain health, raising the risk of dementia, cognitive challenges and mental health issues. 
“A lot of the research on wildfire smoke has historically focused on our lungs and our hearts,” said Stephanie Cleland, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University who studies the health impacts of wildfire smoke. “A shift to focusing on cognitive outcomes and brain health is more recent.”
The latest addition to this body of evidence: Research presented Monday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference suggests that wildfire smoke could raise the chances of a dementia diagnosis.
The study analyzed the health records of more than 1.2 million older adults — ages 60 and up — in Southern California from 2009 to 2019. 
The researchers looked at where people lived to determine their exposure to fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke and other forms of pollution. Their results showed that the odds of getting dementia went up 21% for every additional microgram per cubic meter of fine particulate matter from smoke that participants were exposed to, on average, over three years. 
By contrast, the same increase in exposure to fine particulate matter from other sources — like cars or factories — was linked to a 3% increase in the odds of getting dementia.
The evidence is preliminary, but it makes the case that chronic exposure to wildfire smoke contributes to cognitive decline, said Dr. Holly Elser, the study’s author and a neurology resident at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
However, she said, “the threshold at which wildfire smoke starts to pose a risk for dementia is unknown.”
A study published in August similarly found that higher exposure to fine particulate matter from various sources, including wildfires, was associated with higher rates of dementia. 
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change — which also increases many people’s exposure to smoke. The frequency of extreme wildfires more than doubled from 2003 to 2023, a recent study found.
Scientists think the reason wildfire smoke affects the brain is that the tiny particles within it can cross the barrier between the bloodstream and the brain, causing inflammation in the central nervous system. The particles might also travel directly to the brain via the nose. That, in turn, may affect people’s ability to think, learn or remember.
Dementia isn’t the only potential consequence. A study in 2022 found that adults who’d recently been exposed to wildfire smoke performed worse on a brain training game that measured skills like memory, attention, flexibility, processing speed and problem solving.
“Within hours and days of exposure to wildfire smoke, we’re seeing significant reductions of people’s ability to pay attention,” said Cleland, one of the study’s authors.
Other research published the same year showed that exposure to wildfire smoke during the school year reduced students’ test scores relative to a year with no smoke.
“The more smoke you get, the worse you do on the tests,” said Marshall Burke, an associate professor of global environmental policy at Stanford University, who co-authored that study. “The effect on any individual student is probably pretty small, but if you add up across students and add up across schools, these amount to pretty large overall aggregate learning losses.”
Burke said he has some doubts about the dementia findings released this week, however, because wildfire smoke and other forms of pollution are “not an apples-to-apples comparison.” 
Elser acknowledged that many questions remain about smoke’s effects on the brain. It’s unclear, for example, whether smoke triggers dementia in healthy people or just among those who were already at risk. 
“It’s a really intriguing question, whether this is creating new dementia cases that never would have occurred, or whether it’s simply accelerating the onset of clinically apparent dementia,” she said.
Other lingering questions pertain to the link between wildfire smoke and mental health. A February study found that exposure to wildfire smoke in the western U.S. was associated with increased emergency department visits for anxiety. (Air pollution in general has been shown to be associated with depression and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.) 
Elser said it’s possible that wildfire smoke changes the neurochemistry in people’s brains, which could drive depression and anxiety. But it’s also possible that the anxiety and stress of experiencing or living through a wildfire could independently lead to mental health challenges.
Other health consequences of wildfire smoke are much better understood. Scientists have known for decades that when fine particles from smoke are inhaled, they can travel deep into the lungs or enter the bloodstream, raising the risk of asthma, stroke, heart attack, lung cancer and low birth weight in newborns. 
Cleland said it’s not just people in fire-prone areas of the U.S. who have to worry about these risks, as evidenced by the Canadian wildfires last summer that blanketed parts of the Midwest and Northeast in smoke.
“Last summer completely changed our conversation around who’s exposed to wildfire smoke,” she said. “Oregon, California, Washington, British Columbia really experience a lot of wildfire smoke, but that doesn’t mean places like the Northeast U.S. or Ontario are immune.” 
To reduce exposure to wildfire smoke, experts recommend that people in areas with an Air Quality Index reading of 100 or higher avoid outdoor activities, close all windows, run indoor air filters and wear an N95 mask if they need to go outside. Aria Bendix is the breaking health reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_10,"More flooding hits Vermont with washed-out roads, smashed vehicles and destroyed homes",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/flooding-hits-vermont-washed-roads-smashed-vehicles-destroyed-homes-rcna164409,2024-07-31 08:00:02.778514,,"LYNDON, Vt. — Thunderstorms and torrential rain brought another wave of violent floods Tuesday that caved in roads, crushed vehicles, pushed homes off their foundations and led to dramatic boat rescues in northeastern Vermont, nearly three weeks after flooding from Hurricane Beryl.
Flash flood warnings remained in effect through Tuesday afternoon hours after some areas got 6 to more than 8 inches starting late the night before.
In Lyndonville, a village about 40 miles northeast of Montpelier, the state capital, Deryck Colburn said he awoke before daybreak to a neighbor pounding on his door. Colburn said he heard the same surge of rushing water from an overflowing brook that he’d heard earlier in July, along with the unnerving sound of tumbling boulders carried by the water.
“I went down the road to her house, and there was no road. There was just a river,” he said.
The fresh flooding yielded similar scenes of catastrophe to the flooding weeks earlier, but on a smaller scale. Cars and trucks were smashed and covered in mud; several homes were destroyed and pushed downstream; utility poles and power lines were knocked down; and asphalt roads yielded to cliffs in spots where roadbeds were carved away.
Most of the rain fell in the Lyndon and Lyndonville areas, and in St. Johnsbury, about 10 miles south. Police issued a “shelter in place” advisory Tuesday morning for St. Johnsbury, a town of about 6,000 people. At least 5 inches of rain fell farther north in area of Morgan, which is near the Canada border.
Mark Bosma, a spokesperson for the Vermont Emergency Management Agency, said swift water rescue teams in boats conducted approximately two dozen rescues in the dark in the hardest-hit areas late Monday and early Tuesday.
Some neighbors had to rescue themselves.
In Lyndonville, Jason Pilbin said he woke up at about 2:30 a.m. to boulders rolling down the road, propelled by heavy floodwaters. He went outside with a headlamp and flashlight to help some neighbors evacuate and then collected their vital medications about 20 minutes before the house broke in half. Then he woke up another neighbor and helped her exit her home, as well.
Pilbin said he was relieved to be able to help neighbors this time after watching helplessly as a man drowned in floodwaters earlier this month. “Unfortunately I wasn’t able to save him, but I was able to save these” people, Pilbin said. “I guess that makes up for some of it. It’s been rough.”
There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or deaths for this round of flooding.
In St. Johnsbury, Vanessa Allen said she knew there was a possibility of rain, but wasn’t counting on the excessive amount.
“This is devastating and was completely unexpected,” she said. “I had no idea this was coming.”
Her home was situated between two road washouts, so she was unable to leave. The roads were pockmarked and covered in debris. Nearby, she said, a house was off its foundation and blocking a road.“It looks apocalyptic. There are huge craters. ... And the water is still rushing down the road now,” she said at midday. “It’s just all unbelievable how bad the roads are. We’re trapped. We can’t go anywhere.”
The state experienced major flooding earlier in July from the tail end of Hurricane Beryl. The flooding destroyed roads and bridges and inundated farms. It came exactly a year after a previous bout of severe flooding hit Vermont and several other states.
Vermont has experienced four flooding events in the last year, due to a combination of climate change and the state’s mountainous geography, said Peter Banacos, science and operations officer with the weather service. Greater rainfall has made the state and its steep terrain more susceptible to flooding, he said.
The state’s soil has also been more frequently saturated, and that increases the possibility of flooding, Bancos said.
Vermont’s history of heavily manipulating its rivers and streams also plays a role in increased flooding, said Julie Moore, secretary of the state Agency of Natural Resources. Increased flooding is “a reflection of having reached our limits of being able to truly manage rivers and hold them in place,” she continued.
Roads, bridges, culverts and wastewater facilities are all especially vulnerable, Moore said. The state is in the midst of a multidecade effort to “replace them or refurbish them with our current and future climate in mind,” Moore said.
Vermont is also working to establish statewide floodplain standards.
In Lyndonville, Colburn said some of his neighbors’ homes on his road “washed away” during this storm but that the occupants were rescued. The emergency management agency did not have further information.
“The last storm was a wake-up call,” he said of the flooding earlier this month. “I thought I would never see anything like that again. I don’t think that holds a candle to this. Not even close.”
“There’s a lot of broken hearts,” he added.The Associated Press"
NBC_11,Far-right protesters clash with police near the site of U.K. stabbing attack that killed 3 girls,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/southport-stabbing-attack-far-right-clashes-uk-police-girls-killed-rcna164434,2024-07-31 17:00:06.418004,,"Far-right protesters fueled by anger and false online rumors hurled bottles and stones at police, wounding more than 20 officers Tuesday outside a northwest England mosque near where three girls were fatally stabbed a day earlier.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the “thuggery” and said the crowd had hijacked what had earlier been a peaceful vigil attended by hundreds in the center of Southport to mourn the dead and 10 surviving stabbing victims, seven of whom were in critical condition.
Police said the violent crowd that torched a police van and several cars was believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, a far-right group, and the mayhem was inspired by rumors about the identity of the teenage suspect arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.
“There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” Merseyside Police Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said.
Police previously said a suspect’s name circulating on social media was incorrect and the boy was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum seeker.
The Liverpool Region Mosque Network posted a statement decrying the “heinous” stabbing as an attack against society that was unconnected to Islam.
“A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community,” the group said on the X social media platform. “Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.”
Officers outside the Southport Mosque in riot gear were pelted with bricks torn from garden walls in the residential neighborhood by members of the crowd, some of whom wore masks, amid chants of “No surrender!” and “English till I die!” Firecrackers exploded, sirens wailed and a helicopter hovering overhead added to the chaos.
Twenty-two officers were hurt, with eight suffering from more serious injuries that included fractures, lacerations and a concussion. Two police dogs were wounded by bricks and a third suffered burns.
A day earlier, a short distance from the turmoil, the girls had taken part in a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop on the first week of summer vacation when a teen armed with a knife entered the studio and began a vicious attack, police said.
“It’s difficult to comprehend or put into words the horror of what happened,” Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said while briefing members of Parliament. “What should have been a joyful start to the summer turned into an unspeakable tragedy.”Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries, police said.
“Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess,” Aguiar’s parents said in a statement released by police. “Like we said before to you, you’re always our princess and no one would change that.”
King’s family said no words could describe their devastation at the loss “of our little girl Bebe.”
Eight children and two adults remained hospitalized after the attack. Both adults and five of the children were in critical condition.
An emotional crowd that gathered in Southport outside The Atkinson theater and museum in the early evening held a minute of silence for the victims.
June Burns, the mayor of the Sefton region that contains Southport, called for calm and respect and urged people to be good to one another. She said she was overcome with emotion when she visited the scene of the tragedy earlier.
“It’s unbelievable that we find ourselves laying flowers for little girls who just wanted to dance,” she said.
Swift said earlier on Instagram that she was “completely in shock” and still taking in “the horror” of the event.
“These were just little kids at a dance class,” she wrote. “I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families.”
People left flowers and stuffed animals in tribute at a police cordon on the street lined with brick houses in the seaside resort near Liverpool where the beach and pier attract vacationers. They also posted online messages of support for teacher Leanne Lucas, the organizer of the event, who was one of those attacked.
The 17-year-old suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder shortly after the attacks just before noon. Police said he was born in Cardiff, Wales, and had lived for years in a village about 3 miles from Southport. He has not yet been charged.
The rampage is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, which are by far the most commonly used instruments in U.K. homicides.
The prime minister was jeered by some as he visited the crime scene and lay a wreath of pink and white flowers with a handwritten note that said: “Our hearts are broken, there are no words for such profound loss. The nation’s thoughts are with you.”
“How many more children?” one person yelled as Starmer was getting in his car. “Our kids are dead and you’re leaving already?”
Starmer told reporters earlier that he is determined to get a grip on high levels of knife crime but said it was not a day for politics.
Witnesses described hearing screams and seeing children covered in blood in the mayhem outside the Hart Space, a community center that hosts everything from pregnancy workshops to women’s boot camps.
Joel Verite, a window cleaner riding in a van on his lunch break, said his colleague slammed on the brakes and reversed to where a woman was hanging on the side of a car covered in blood.
“She just screamed at me: ‘He’s killing kids over there. He’s killing kids over there,”‘ Verite told Sky News. (Sky News is owned by Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)
The woman, who was on the phone with police, directed him to where the violence was unfolding and then collapsed. Verite said he ran in the direction she had pointed.
A woman honking the horn of her car caught his attention and he found her with five or six bloody children inside. The woman said she was trying to get the kids to safety.
“It was like a scene you’d see on a disaster film,” he said. “I can’t explain to you how horrific it is what I saw.”
He ran to the dance studio, where he was startled to lock eyes with a man in a hooded tracksuit holding a knife at the top of the stairs.
“All I saw was a knife and I thought: ‘There are more people in there,’ and I just wanted to hurt him so bad,” Verite said. “But I was scared for myself and I wanted to help people. So I came outside and I was screaming because I knew where he was.”
Britain’s worst attack on children occurred in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot 16 kindergartners and their teacher dead in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The U.K. subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.
Mass shootings and killings with firearms are exceptionally rare in Britain, where knives were used in about 40% of homicides in the year to March 2023.
Mass stabbings are also very rare, according to Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence.
“Most knife attacks are one-on-one and personal — either domestic violence or gang related — so this tragedy is very unusual and, accordingly, garners lots of media interest,” Overton said. “This offers no comfort to the grieving families, of course.”The Associated Press"
NBC_12,"Eating more processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of dementia, study suggests",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/eating-processed-red-meat-linked-increased-risk-dementia-study-suggest-rcna161555,2024-07-31 19:00:02.920049,,"A diet rich in processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of dementia, according to new research presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Philadelphia. 
The findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, are the result of a four-decade study of more than 130,000 adults that looked at the link between diet and cognition.
“This is one of the most robust studies I’ve seen that’s associating processed meat consumption and dementia, because they actually followed individuals for decades,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, the chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association.
The researchers found that the people in the study who ate at least two servings per week of processed red meat (such as bacon, bologna or hot dogs) had a 14% increased risk of dementia, compared to those who ate less than three servings per month, after the 43-year follow-up period. 
The study also found that every additional daily serving of processed red meat was linked to an additional 1.6 years of cognitive aging, specifically in the area affecting a person’s language ability and executive function, which includes mental skills that control behavior.
The results weren’t all bad news, however. The study found that replacing one serving of processed red meat a day with one serving of nuts or beans was linked to a 20% lower risk of cognitive decline.
“This is really consistent with a larger body of science that tells us that diets that are lower in fat, lower in sugar, higher in vegetables overall, are what’s really better for our brain health,” said Dr. Heather Snyder, the Alzheimer’s Association vice president of medical and scientific relations.
The study adds to a growing body of research showing that processed foods can lead to poorer health across the board.
“Processed red meat has also been shown to raise the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes,” the study’s lead author, Yuhan Li, a research assistant in the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in a statement. 
“It may affect the brain because it has high levels of harmful substances such as nitrites (preservatives) and sodium.”
Carrillo noted that unprocessed red meats — such as ground beef or steak — weren’t linked to the same cognitive harms in the study. 
“When it’s not processed, in moderation, red meat is actually OK,” she said. 
Dr. Uma Naidoo, a psychiatrist and director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the size and the duration of the study strengthened the results. She noted, however, that the findings were observational and therefore do not show that eating processed red meat definitively causes dementia. 
Snyder also acknowledged that while the study, which was conducted in a mostly white and higher socioeconomic group of health care professionals, may not represent the broader U.S. population, it still points in the general direction of reducing processed red meat intake as a way to improve brain health. 
One of Naidoo’s major takeaways from the study was that people should seek out whole, fresh foods as much as possible. 
“The less processed, the better,” Naidoo said. “Good servings of vegetables and fruits bring fiber, nutrients, minerals and vitamins to the body and the brain.” 
She pointed to research showing that diets with whole, fresh foods are linked to longer lifespans and reduced health problems.
Naidoo also offered suggestions for people who don’t have regular access to whole, fresh foods. Canned fish and beans, as well as frozen vegetables, can be affordable and widely accessible sources of protein and other nutrients for people seeking alternatives to processed red meat. Canned beans can be drained and rinsed to reduce their sodium content, and frozen vegetables can serve as whole foods because they are flash frozen at peak ripeness. Even so, Naidoo recommends looking out for low-sodium options for those who decide to add these foods to their diet. 
Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, said that a healthy diet is only one part of an overall healthy lifestyle to stave off dementia. 
“You not only need to eat fresh, healthy food, but you also need a healthy lifestyle — enough sleep, exercise, social contact, and leisure activities. All of these things work together for better health conditions,” Gu said.
Carrillo agreed. “It’s important to remember that these decisions, even if they feel small, have long-term impacts,” she said. “These are things that we have to continuously think about, because we’re living longer, and we want to be as healthy as possible as we live longer,” she said. Mustafa Fattah is a medical fellow with the NBC News Health and Medical Unit. "

Mark Kelly rips Trump over role in killing bipartisan border bill,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/sen-mark-kelly-rips-trump-role-killing-bipartisan-border-bill-rcna164443,2024-07-31 20:00:02.729272,,"Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., on Tuesday went after former President Donald Trump over his role in sinking a bipartisan Senate bill as the former president seeks to cast Vice President Kamala Harris as a “border czar” who failed to secure the border amid record increases of migrant crossings.
“This was not meeting the Republicans on the 50 yard line, this was meeting them on the 10 yard line,” Kelly said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” referring to the bipartisan border bill that would have imposed tough overhauls on the border, but was killed after Trump pressured GOP lawmakers to vote against it.
“On their side of the field, we realized, we’ve got to get operational control over the border. I realized this, Kamala Harris realizes this, and this legislation was going to do that,” he added. “And our goal here was to get this legislation passed and then start working on comprehensive immigration reform. But this was stopped dead in its tracks by Donald Trump because he wanted to have this as an election issue. Like a lot of other Republicans, they don’t actually want to solve this problem.”
Kelly, who is on the short list to be Harris’ running mate, has been a vocal critic on the Biden administration’s approach to border security, but is now viewed as a potential buffer for Harris against attacks from Trump and his allies on her record on the border and immigration.
Trump has largely focused on immigration in his recent attacks on Harris. The former president has argued that Harris failed to secure the border after President Joe Biden in 2021 tasked her with addressing the influx of migrants from Central American countries to the southern border and the root causes of migration.
Harris has pushed back on Trump’s attacks, citing her time serving as attorney general of California. 
“In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers,” Harris said during a Monday night rally in Atlanta. “I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.” 
In his “Morning Joe” interview, Kelly declined to confirm whether he has been in touch with Harris’ campaign recently.
“I’m not going to get into any of that. I am going to be focused on making sure that Kamala is the next president. I’m going to work as hard as I can,” he said, noting that his wife, former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, has been stumping for Harris in battleground states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.
“My plan’s right now is to be in Arizona,” he added. “Arizona is important not only for who is going to be in the White House, but also who’s going to keep control the United States Senate.”Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News."
NBC_15,Arizona official who defended state's elections loses GOP primary,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/maricopa-county-recorder-stephen-richer-loses-gop-primary-rcna164046,2024-07-31 21:49:02.835095,,"PHOENIX — Incumbent Stephen Richer was ousted in his Republican primary for Maricopa County recorder, an outcome that could have a major impact on how elections are administered in the nation’s most populous battleground county.  
State Rep. Justin Heap had 42.4% support to 35.9% for Richer when The Associated Press called the race Wednesday morning. Don Hiatt, a candidate who worked in information management technology, took 21.8%. 
Richer is an outspoken defender of the swing state’s election process who forcefully pushed back against the unfounded voter fraud claims that spread after the 2020 and 2022 races. 
Heap, a critic of Maricopa elections in years past, has dodged questions about whether the 2020 election was fraudulent. He was endorsed by many prominent Arizona Republicans who have refused to accept Joe Biden’s victory four years ago, including Kari Lake, who is running for U.S. Senate this year after her failed 2022 gubernatorial campaign. 
“I am endorsing Justin Heap for the Maricopa County recorder because we want honest elections,” Lake said at a campaign event in Goodyear, Ariz., in June. “We need a heap of honesty in our elections.”
The primary for Maricopa County recorder, a job with a vast administrative role that includes processing deeds and overseeing the voter file and other parts of elections, is typically a sleepy affair. But the contest was much more heated this year, as Maricopa, the largest county of a key battleground state, has emerged as a hotbed for unfounded election fraud claims.
After ballot printers and vote tabulation machines malfunctioned during Arizona’s 2022 election, baseless claims of malicious activity arose, and conspiracy theories about Richer resulted in Richer’s facing death threats. 
Richer has continued to face a slew of attacks. Last month, he posted a video on X of Shelby Busch, the chair of Arizona’s delegation to the 2024 Republican National Convention, saying she would “lynch” him if she had the chance. The video stemmed from a live-streamed event on Rumble, a conservative video platform, in Mesa on March 20. 
The three GOP recorder candidates squared off in a debate in late June, and Heap claimed Richer’s track record tarnished Arizona on a national scale.
“I’m running for this office because Maricopa County’s elections made us a national laughing stock,” Heap said at the debate in late June.
Heap will now face Democrat Tim Stringham, who ran unopposed in his party’s primary, in the general election.Alex Tabet is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed."
NBC_16,Boar's Head recall expands to include 7 million pounds of deli meat over listeria concerns,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/boars-head-recall-expands-include-7-million-pounds-deli-meat-listeria-rcna164446,2024-07-31 21:00:02.835095,,"A recall of Boar’s Head products has expanded to include a whopping 7 million additional pounds of deli and poultry items in a deadly multistate outbreak of listeria infections.
As of Tuesday, 34 people have gotten sick across 13 states in the outbreak — including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths. The fatalities were a patient in Illinois and another in New Jersey.
Last week, the deli meat company had recalled more than 207,000 pounds of deli meat, including liverwurst and ham products, because they may contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes.
Boar's Head has now expanded that recall, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced in a press release Tuesday. 
The expansion includes 71 products — including meat intended for slicing at delis, and some packaged meat and poultry products —produced from May 10 to July 29 under the Boar’s Head and Old Country Brand names.
The products have “sell by” dates ranging from July 29 through Oct. 17 this year (view the recalled product labels here), and were distributed to retail locations nationwide, and some to Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama. 
Boar's Head said in a statement on its website that it had initiated the recall after a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Department of Health had tested positive for listeria. 
The Maryland Department of Heath and Baltimore City Health Department collected an unopened liverwurst product from a retail store for further testing that determined the product sample “tested positive for the outbreak strain,” the USDA release said.
Boar's Head said that the first voluntary recall was for its Strassburger Brand Liverwurst, and an additional nine products produced on the same production line at its Jarratt, Virginia, facility. 
On Monday, the company said it learned from the USDA “that our Strassburger Brand Liverwurst has been linked to the national deli meat Listeria monocytogenes outbreak” — and as a result the recall was expanded to include all items produced at the Jarratt facility.
“We have also decided to pause ready-to-eat operations at this facility until further notice. As a company that prioritizes safety and quality, we believe it is the right thing to do,” the company said.
“No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for the families that have suffered losses and others who endured illness,” the statement added.
People who bought the recalled products should throw them away or return them to the store, and also clean out their refrigerators as the bacteria can grow in cold temperatures and spread to other foods.
An investigation is underway by the FSIS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health partners. 
Listeria infection is a food borne bacterial illness, most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products, according to the Mayo Clinic. It’s the third-leading cause of death from food poisoning in the U.S.
Symptoms usually appear within two weeks of eating contaminated food, and include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, stiff neck and confusion. In severe cases, the bacteria may cause a blood infection or meningitis. The infection is dangerous for those who are older, with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.
The CDC estimates that around 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die. Most cases aren’t linked to outbreaks, but there are usually a few outbreaks in a given year.Breaking News Reporter

NBC_17,"California wildfire grows to state's fifth largest, bringing devastation and evacuations",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wildfires-bring-devastation-evacuations-california-rockies-rcna164438,2024-07-31 21:00:02.835095,,"Emergency services are battling raging wildfires across Southern California as communities begin to pick up the pieces after homes were destroyed.
For areas such as Cohasset, in Butte County, which has been ravaged by the enormous Park Fire, evacuation orders have been lifted but now the slow process of recovery has begun.
""This community's going to need a lot of support, a lot of aid. It’s a rural community, it’s not a city or a town, there’s no governmental structure here,"" Dan Collins, public information officer for Cal Fire said Tuesday.
""There are people that live here with little to no means and they just lost everything they own or everything they ever had,"" he said, adding that a local residents' association was asking for donations to help rebuild.The Park Fire, the fifth-largest in California’s history, has so far burned through more than 380,000 acres, or 600 square miles, across four counties and is just 18% contained, California’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said late Tuesday.
The fire's threat is far from over, as it continued to burn through inaccessible terrain full of dense vegetation. ""That’s going to be a continued challenge for us moving forward over the next couple of days,"" said Mark Brunton, an operations section chief with Cal Fire.The recently named Nixon Fire has burned through 4,500 acres or 7 square miles and was 0% contained on Tuesday night.
Dramatic video taken from a bodyworn camera shows a firefighter shooting water into the Park Fire along a roadside in California's Central Valley, with thick smoke filling the sky. The firefighter, who can be heard coughing, was part of a team that included 10 fire engines, bulldozers, a helicopter and 15 other personnel, Cal Fire's Sonoma-Lake Napa United said in a post on X.
Overall 5,500 firefighters are working just to stop the Park Fire, which has fed on dry grass and timber after a prolonged heat wave.
So far this year fires have burned through 750,000 acres, or 1,100 miles, across California, authorities say, a 2,800% increase on last year. Fire is causing devastation elsewhere, too.
More than 600 homes were evacuated after a new blaze ignited near Deer Creek Canyon, southwest of Denver, Colorado. A mandatory evacuation order is in place for Deer Creek Mesa, Sampson and Maxwell subdivisions southwest of Ken Caryl, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said.
Named the Quarry Fire, the blaze grew to more than 100 acres overnight after it was spotted by a sheriff's deputy at 9 p.m. MST Tuesday.
One couple whose house is a quarter mile from the fire, were told to leave at 1:15 am. At first, they thought it was a prank.""The doorbell rang again. There was a flashlight in the window — it was the sheriff telling us we had to evacuate. There was a fire,"" Doug Ideker told NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver.
“I looked out the window and saw smoke and I could smell it so I felt a real sense of urgency we didn’t really have time to prep anything,"" his wife Terrie said.
The Alexander Mountain Fire and Stone Canyon Fires, both north of Boulder, are 80 miles apart but had overlapping evacuation orders Tuesday night.I cover early morning U.S. breaking news, everything from severe weather to crime.

NBC_18,Team USA's Lauren Scruggs on taking silver in fencing and making Olympic history,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/url-lauren-scruggs-fencing-win-medal-olympic-history-rcna164127,2024-07-31 22:27:02.864917,,"American Lauren Scruggs made history at the Paris Olympics on Sunday when she took the silver medal in women’s foil fencing.
Scruggs, from Queens, New York, became the first Black American woman and the first Black out lesbian to win an individual fencing medal. 
She described the experience as “surreal” and said she hopes her medal shows other people that fencing, which has historically lacked diversity, “is for you.”
“You get more diverse people getting into fencing when they see people like them,” Scruggs, 21, told NBC News in a video interview. “I hope to be an example of who can fence. Hopefully people like me who identify similar to me feel that this sport is the place for them.”
Her teammate, Lee Kiefer, 30, won the final 15-6 Sunday to defend her gold medal in the event.
When she was young, Scruggs trained under Peter Westbrook — the first Black man from the United States to win an Olympic medal in fencing — through his foundation, which supports underrepresented youth through fencing.
She said her favorite part of her Olympic debut, aside from winning a medal, has been being in the Olympic Village and “casually walking past” medalists such as swimmer Katie Ledecky and gymnast Simone Biles and talking to tennis star Coco Gauff. 
“It’s just crazy to always be surrounded by such amazing athletes and that just to be the norm,” Scruggs said. “And I guess I am one of those amazing athletes,” she said, laughing. “But it’s just kind of crazy to just be in that environment.”
Scruggs started fencing at age 6 after her older brother, Nolen, started taking lessons. She said she loves the nature of the competition. 
“It’s very mentally stimulating,” she said. “It’s a combat sport, so I think it’s unique in the sense that you get to fight someone, but it’s also you’re not really fighting them, like with boxing. So it’s a very interesting sport to me.”
She said she did receive pushback growing up in the sport, but most of it was related to her race and not her sexual orientation. 
“I just felt like no one was really on my side at tournaments, even from a young age,” she said. “So that kind of pushed me to kind of fight more at the tournaments and prove that I really belonged and that nothing was going to put me down.”
She said that being gay further isolated her but that she had a supportive group of close friends.  
Scruggs is a rising senior at Harvard University studying philosophy and plans to work in finance. She met her girlfriend, Chelsea, whose photos she often shares on social media, through a friend during freshman year. 
She said that she usually goes to New York City’s LGBTQ Pride march every June and loves to “soak up the energy” in Washington Square Park, but that this year she didn’t go because she was at a fencing tournament. 
“But we won the tournament,” she quipped. “So I guess that counts as a celebration.”
In addition to her historic firsts, Scruggs is also the second LGBTQ person to medal in a women’s fencing event following French fencer Astrid Guyart, who won a silver medal in the team women’s foil at the Tokyo Olympics, according to Cyd Zeigler, the co-founder of LGBTQ sports website Outsports.
Zeigler noted that Scruggs became the second LGBTQ athlete to medal at the Paris Games, following Amandine Buchard from France, who won a silver in women’s judo.
“That two Black gay women won the first Paris Olympics medals for Team LGBTQ is a powerful sign of our times,"" Zeigler said. ""For Lauren to do that in a sport like fencing, where Black athletes have not been particularly visible over the years, makes the incredible accomplishment of her and judoka Amandine particularly special.”
At least 193 out LGBTQ athletes are competing in the 2024 Summer Games, according to Outsports, surpassing the previous record set by the Tokyo Olympics, where at least 186 out athletes competed.

NBC_19,How the sole white guy on Team Japan’s Olympic basketball team made the cut,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/team-japan-mens-basketball-paris-olympics-josh-hawkinson-rcna164292,2024-07-31 22:00:02.864917,,"As Japan’s men’s basketball team attempts to rebound from some losses at the Paris Olympics, one player’s presence on the team has generated some buzz among surprised fans. 
Josh Hawkinson, a U.S.-born player from Shoreline, Washington, is the team’s sole white player — with no ancestral roots in Japan. Though his presence has been confusing for some, Hawkinson, who made his debut with the team Saturday, is a Japanese citizen who has played in the country for several years and has said he has fallen in love with the culture.
“I’m really excited to be a part of it, and there’s only a handful of people who get the opportunity to be Olympians,” he told NBC affiliate KING of Seattle about playing for Team Japan. 
Hawkinson, the starting center, played most recently Tuesday in a game against France, which his team lost 94-90. Hawkinson recorded 16 points, 8 rebounds and an assist, earning praise for his impressive play against France’s Victor Wembanyama, one of the most dominant players in the NBA. 
Social media users have also been jokingly comparing him to white characters in movies set in Japan, including Tom Cruise’s “Last Samurai” and Cosmo Jarvis' character, John Blackthorne, an English pilot, in the feudal Japan-based series “Shōgun.” 
But as the international rules go, national basketball teams are allowed one naturalized player on each 12-man roster. And Hawkinson became a naturalized citizen last year after having played in Japan’s B.League since 2017. While international audiences are just becoming acquainted with him, Japanese fans have embraced Hawkinson as he has played with the Toyotsu Fighting Eagles and the Shinshu Brave Warriors. He’s currently on the Sun Rockers Shibuya, for whom he averaged 17 points and 8 rebounds last season.  
“It’s been an incredible opportunity and an experience just kind of trying to raise the level of Japanese basketball and seeing how much the game has grown there,” Hawkinson told KING. “So I’m really proud of the fact that I’m a part of that.”
Transitioning to playing in Japan was initially difficult, Hawkinson said, and he admitted feeling homesick for the U.S. in those early days. But he said a mindset change helped him lean in to his new surroundings. 
“At first I was living my life in Japan like I was still an American, but that’s the wrong way to do it,” he said. “You need to embrace the culture, embrace the language, embrace the people, and that’s when I started to love Japan.” 
Now, Hawkinson is living it up. He has learned Japanese, and, of course, he dived right into the cuisine. 
“I knew they had ramen and sushi and those type of things, but I didn’t know the depth of how good Japanese food is,” he said in an interview on “The Jeremy Mills Podcast,” adding that some of his favorite dishes are wagyu beef and karaage chicken, or Japanese fried chicken. “I’m a fan of takoyaki, which is like … a pancake batter ball with little chunks of octopus and a sweet glaze on the top.”
Before his time in Japan, Hawkinson was largely known for his successful college career at Washington State. He completed his college career with 40 double-doubles, the third most in the school’s history. 
Hawkinson is joined on Team Japan by several recognizable basketball players, including Los Angeles Lakers power forward Rui Hachimura. Former NBA player Yuta Watanabe is also on the squad, as well as college basketball icon Keisei Tominaga, a former guard at the University of Nebraska.

“It just feels so incredible. I’m super excited and super proud of this team and everything that we’ve overcome to get back here on top of the podium again,” Carey told ""TODAY"" co-anchors Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie.
Despite not feeling well before Sunday's qualifiers, Carey landed an excellent vault in front of a star-studded crowd to help lift her team to victory in the final.
“A lot of pressure on that one vault, but I knew that if I was just my normal self that I would get the job done,"" Carey said.
Her performance was followed by a stunning bar routine from Suni Lee and, to no surprise, a sensational floor performance from Simone Biles. Jordan Chiles also shined on floor.
Hezly Rivera, the youngest team member at 16, did not compete in the team final but expressed pride and disbelief in being able to compete alongside Biles.
“I never thought that would happen, being on the same team as Simone. I’ve always looked up to her,"" Rivera said, after photos showed Biles visiting Rivera's gym when she was a kid.
On Tuesday, Biles became the most decorated gymnast with eight Olympic medals.
Biles posted on X after the win that the official team name was the ""Golden Girls,"" alluding to both their victory and the older ages of several of their members.
Carey and Rivera said the name was ""perfect.""
The pair will cheer on Biles and Lee in the all-around event on Thursday. Carey will then compete in the individual vault event on Saturday.News Associate "
NBC_21,"Team USA stuns rugby world with historic medal win, planting flag for sport in America",https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/team-usa-stun-rugby-world-outrageous-medal-win-planting-flag-sport-ame-rcna164445,2024-07-31 23:00:02.833539,,"PARIS — 	There’s no real equivalent of Little League for rugby in America.
A version of “Hoosiers” or “Friday Night Lights” hasn’t been made — not yet, at least — to romanticize the popular English-rooted sport to U.S. audiences.
Yet somehow, a dozen 20- and 30-something American women tripped into this sport and then went toe-to-toe against elite athletes from countries where rugby is sacred.
""Yeah, it's a little crazy, huh?"" U.S. player Kristi Kirshe told NBC News on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the Eagles stunned the rugby sevens world with a miraculous 14-12 victory over Australia to bring home the first medal in the sport for U.S. women.
Salt Lake City native Alex ""Spiff"" Sedrick furiously ran the length of the field as time expired and then hit a bronze-clinching conversion for the dramatic win.
""It's kind of still surreal,"" Kirshe said. ""I don't think it's really fully sunk in yet. We're all excited and kind of just feeling the gravity of it all."" 
The rosters of world powers like the gold medal Black Ferns of New Zealand and 2016 Olympic champs Australia are littered with players who were rugby prodigies in high school and younger.
U.S. captain Naya Tapper was a freshman at the University of North Carolina looking forward to the classroom and meeting new friends when she learned about a Tar Heels rugby club team.
That was a dozen years ago, and now the former high school track standout is wearing an Olympic medal.
“Outrageous,” a smiling Tapper said, still trying to grasp how far the program has come in so few years.
Tapper, who turns 30 this weekend, said she considers herself lucky to have found the sport in 2012 because the bar has been rising so quickly.
""If I would have found it now, with how much the sport has grown, I wouldn't have gotten onto the team,"" Tapper said. ""I'm very grateful for the way the timing worked out."" 
The U.S. roster is filled with athletes who previously excelled at other sports before giving rugby a chance. 
Alev Kelter, a 33-year-old Eagle River, Alaska, native who scored against Australia, played hockey at powerhouse University of Wisconsin.
Reno, Nevada, native Stephanie Rovetti was an elite high school sprinter and a rotation guard for a Brigham Young University basketball squad that went to the Sweet 16 in 2014.
Kirshe, from Franklin, Massachusetts, was a former Division III soccer standout at Williams College and didn't come to rugby until she was 23.
The 29-year-old missed playing high-level sports, and when a high school friend suggested rugby, her life would never be the same.
""So one of my friends from high school was, like, 'Why don't you give rugby a shot?'"" Kirshe said. ""She had played club when she was in college, so she suggested that I give it a try and it's changed my life."" 
Rugby is not played as an interscholastic championship sport in any of the 50 states, a representative for the National Federation of State High School Associations said Wednesday.
But even if rugby never gains a football-, baseball-, basketball- or soccer-like following in the United States, Tapper still believes the United States could be a world player.
“The great thing about America and the athletes from America is that we’re so, so talented and we’re also very smart,” she said. “With that combination, if we can teach somebody how to play a certain sport and give them a year or two to figure out the skills aspect, as you can see from our team of crossover athletes, you can get the success you want, at the same level with teams that can start when they’re very young.”
Kirshe said she hopes little girls across America know a little more about rugby today than they did before Tuesday.
""That's something we talk about all the time,"" she said. ""It's just like, bringing such an amazing sport to little girls around the country. Look at our team of all shapes and sizes, and everyone has their role on the field. So I hope that little girls at home see all of us and say, 'Hey, I want to be a powerful woman like that someday.'"" Charlotte Gardiner is a producer for NBC News, based in London.

NBC_22,Bodycam video shows fatal police shooting of 4-year-old Illinois boy and man holding him hostage,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bodycam-video-shows-fatal-police-shooting-4-year-old-illinois-boy-man-rcna164460,2024-08-01 01:17:02.623376,,"Body camera video was released this week of a March 16 police shooting that killed an Illinois man and the 4-year-old boy he was holding hostage. 
The Macomb Police Department released the edited video on Monday after a special prosecutor said he found no basis to charge the officers involved, identified by the police department as Lt. Nick Goc and Officer Korri Cameron.
The officers were placed on leave following the shooting, a standard procedure.
The shooting stemmed from a domestic violence incident at an apartment in Macomb on March 16. Family identified the child killed as Terrell Marshawn Miller. 
Goc and Cameron responded to the residence just after 10 p.m. after police received multiple 911 calls, the department said. One caller had said they believed they heard gunshots, according to the police department.  
When the officers arrived, they found blood smeared on the wall of the building's stairwell, the body camera video shows. Police knocked on the apartment's door, announced their presence and ordered the occupants to open up. 
After the officers heard a woman screaming for help and saying, ""he's stabbing me,"" they forced entry into the apartment, police said. 
The woman is seen in the video running into a living room area. She tells the officers that her son is in another room, the video shows. The child is heard in the video screaming. 
""The officer orders the female with injuries out of the home to safety,"" police say in the narrated body camera footage. ""What happens next transpires in a matter of seconds."" 
The suspect, who is naked and holding a knife in his left hand, dashes into a room and reappears seconds later with a second knife and holding the child hostage. 
Police said the man had one knife by the child's throat and the other by the child's waist. 
One of the officers fire a single shot, the video shows, striking the suspect and the child. Police rendered aid and called for medical personnel but the suspect and child died at the scene, police said.
The woman, Keianna Miller, told local station WGEM that she had returned home to find her ex-boyfriend,  57-year-old Anthony George, intoxicated. 
""Things went left,"" she said. ""He told me, 'If I can’t have you, nobody can.'""
Miller suffered multiple stab wounds during the incident and was treated at a local hospital. 
Authorities said in a March 18 news release that the suspect had refused to comply with multiple commands to drop his weapon and that police were ""fearing for their safety"" when the officer fired. 
But attorney Marleen Suarez, who is representing Miller, Terrell's mother, questioned why police did not try to de-escalate the situation. 
""There was no de-escalation, no negotiations,"" she said at a news conference on Monday. ""I find it hard to believe that in the heat of that moment, he did not stop and think. I don’t know what made him think he could make that shot."" 
According to the attorney, the shooting happened about 16 seconds after police forced entry into the apartment. Suarez said the officer's bullet hit Terrell in the head and struck George in the neck. 
""[Keianna] told them, she was adamant as she was being taken out of the apartment, her baby, her son was back there,"" Suarez told reporters. ""So they were well aware there was a child back there in his bedroom.""
The shooting was investigated by the Illinois State Police and then turned over to the McDonough County State’s Attorney’s Office. Illinois State’s Attorney Appellate Prosecutor determined that the officers would not be charged.  
In a July 8 letter to the county state’s attorney, Special Prosecutor Jonathan H. Barnard said that after reviewing evidence, he found ""that there is no basis for any criminal action or prosecution that is supportable under the facts of this case against any of the officers involved in this tragic accident,"" WGEM reported.
Illinois State Police directed questions to the county state's attorney's office and the state’s attorney appellate prosecutor, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
An internal police investigation remains ongoing. The officers could not be reached at phone numbers listed for them.
Suarez said she plans on filing a lawsuit, stating that the family believes ""the police officer acted recklessly.""Minyvonne Burke is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News."
NBC_23,Taco Bell to roll out AI drive-thru ordering in hundreds of locations by end of year,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/taco-bell-roll-ai-drive-thru-ordering-hundreds-locations-end-year-rcna164524,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"Yum Brands hopes to use artificial intelligence to take down drive-thru orders at hundreds of Taco Bell restaurants by the end of this year.
The restaurant company announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its rollout of the tech in the U.S. as it eyes implementing it in drive-thru lanes globally.
Yum Brands joins restaurant rivals such as Wendy’s and White Castle in betting on voice AI, but its plans are the most ambitious to date. While tech companies may promise that voice AI can speed up service times, reduce labor costs and boost sales through upselling, restaurant companies have taken a more measured approach so far, testing the tech to make sure both its employees and customers enjoy the experience.
In June, McDonald’s said it would end its trial of Automated Order Taker, an AI technology tested in partnership with IBM. The Chicago-based company now plans to turn to other vendors instead.
Yum Brands has moved quickly on its test. In May, executives said Taco Bell would expand its pilot of voice AI from five locations to 30 restaurants in California. Currently, more than 100 Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. use voice AI. Taco Bell had nearly 7,700 U.S. locations at the end of 2023, according to company filings.
Yum Brands said the tech has improved order accuracy, reduced wait times, decreased employees’ task load and fueled profitable growth for the restaurant company and its operators.
“With over two years of fine tuning and testing the drive-thru Voice AI technology, we’re confident in its effectiveness in optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction,” Yum Brands Chief Innovation Officer Lawrence Kim said in a statement.
Five KFC restaurants in Australia are also testing voice AI tech in drive-thrus, Yum Brands said.
Yum Brands is expected to report its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday."
NBC_24,Trump says Harris would be 'like a play toy' to world leaders if elected,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-harris-play-toy-world-leaders-elected-rcna164483,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"Former President Donald Trump said world leaders would treat Vice President Kamala Harris “like a play toy” if she’s elected president.
In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, some of which aired Tuesday, Trump  — who has a long history of making derogatory comments about female opponents — said: “She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy.” 
He added, “They look at her and they say we can’t believe we got so lucky. They’re gonna walk all over her.”
Looking directly into the camera, Trump said, “I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.”
The former president has repeatedly attacked women who have criticized him by mocking their appearances and insulting their character. During the 2016 Republican presidential cycle, he called Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, a ""nasty woman"" — an insult that her supporters turned into a feminist rallying cry — and ""unhinged."" Trump also poked fun at his Republican primary rival Carly Fiorina’s face on television and shared an unflattering photo of Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, on Twitter.
Trump has lobbed personal attacks and unflattering nicknames on his male opponents, but the attacks on his female rivals are often gender-based. He has referred to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as ""crazy,"" adult film actress Stormy Daniels as “horse face,"" and his 2024 primary rival Nikki Haley as “birdbrain.” 
Trump and his allies have pummeled Harris with attacks on her race and gender since she jumped into the presidential race, calling her “crazy” and a “DEI vice president.” They have also made fun of Harris' laugh and called her ""dumb as a rock."" On Wednesday alone, Trump referred to the vice president as ""Crazy Kamala"" at least five times on his Truth Social website.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump was not referring to Harris’ race or gender in the Ingraham interview and slammed Harris on her record on immigration.
“She is weak, dishonest and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” Leavitt said in a statement.
Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance — who is facing backlash himself over comments he made in 2021 about “childless cat ladies” leading the country — repeatedly used the word ""weak"" during a speech in Nevada on Tuesday when describing Harris’ leadership.
“Of all of Kamala Harris’ faults, the worst of all is that she left America weak and vulnerable,"" Vance said. ""The entire world now knows that she helped cover up Joe Biden’s declining mental capacity for years.”
But he told NBC News that there's no ""particular effort to tag her as weak."" Vance added, ""If there’s a particular label we want the American people to be aware of, it’s that she’s an ultra-liberal.”Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News."

The crash unfolded on April 19 when the 56-year-old Tesla driver, of Snohomish County, was driving on autopilot behind the motorcycle on eastbound State Route 522 east of Maltby, according to Washington State Patrol, or WSP. 
The driver told authorities that he was looking down, distracted by his phone, when “the next thing he knew, there was a bang,” and the Tesla hit the motorcycle, a statement of probable cause said, NBC affiliate King 5 of Seattle reported.
Jeffrey Nissen, 28, of Stanwood, Washington, was ejected from the motorcycle and died at the scene, authorities said.
Chris Loftis of WSP told NBC News on Wednesday that the Criminal Investigative Division confirmed the vehicle was in ""Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) mode"" at the time of the collision.
The conclusion was made after downloading information from the event-data recorder on the car, Capt. Deion Glover of WSP told The Associated Press. 
It's illegal to drive in self driving mode without ""active control and attention of the driver,"" Loftis said. ""Bottom line — if you are behind the wheel, you are responsible and must be in full awareness.""
The car in the crash — a 2022 Tesla Model S — was not impaired at the time of the collision, according to WSP.
The driver, who was not named, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission of being distracted while using the autopilot feature. However, the driver was not officially charged. He posted bond before his initial hearing and the case was referred to the prosecutor for an out-of-custody charging decision, authorities said. 
The investigation is still ongoing, and the Snohomish County Prosecutor will ultimately determine if any charges will be filed in the case.

NBC_26,Hamas chief's killing raises prospect of regional war,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-haniye-israel-iran-gaza-hezbollah-hostages-rcna164429,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"Israel warned that no Hamas leader was safe, but the assassination of the militant group's political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran’s capital has sent shockwaves across a region hardened by war and conflict. 
Not only did the strike — which Iran and Hamas have blamed on Israel — deepen fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, it has dimmed hopes for a cease-fire deal that could help wind down the catastrophic war in the Gaza Strip and ensure the release of hostages still being held there.
Iran has vowed vengeance after Haniyeh, 62, was killed in a raid on his home in Tehran, according to Hamas. Iran supports a series of militant groups like Hamas, leading Israel to view it as an existential threat. 
There was no immediate comment or official confirmation from Israel, which typically remains silent on targeted assassinations. Senior government official Amihai Eliyahu welcomed the killing on Wednesday, saying it had made “the world a little better” in a post on X.
Israel and its allies will likely be looking for a way to contain the impact of Haniyeh’s assassination and an attack Tuesday in Beirut to avoid a “full-fledged war” in the region, said Nimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute, based in Washington, D.C.
“That will be the challenge in the coming days,” he said. 
Bilal Saab, an associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based international think tank Chatham House, said a wider war wasn't a certainty. 
While it might appear as if ""we're getting closer to a war in the region,"" ultimately it's unlikely that either Iran or Israel want to go to war against each other, he said.
“That is the ultimate paradox,” said Saab, a former U.S. Defense Department official and head of the U.S.-Middle East practice of Trends Research and Advisory, a consulting firm based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
Both Hamas and Iran almost immediately blamed Haniyeh's assassination on Israel, which had promised to kill Hamas leaders over the group’s Oct. 7 terror attack and had targeted his family and other senior members of the movement.
Hamas and Iran promised vengeance after the assassination, which was carried out after Haniyeh had attended the inauguration ceremony for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. 
""The criminal, terrorist Zionist regime martyred our dear guest in our territory and has caused our grief, but it has also prepared the ground for a severe punishment,"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement on X, underlining how the Islamic Republic is likely seeing the attack as a severe violation of its sovereignty. 
Pezeshkian, who has been described as a reformist open to improving relations with the West, also vowed to make Israel regret killing Haniyeh.
Hamas said Israel had taken “the battle to new dimensions.”
Tensions between Iran and Israel have simmered, if not boiled, for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which does not officially recognize Israel's right to exist and has been a significant supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Israel has long viewed Iran as an existential threat, particularly due to its backing of militant groups in the region, known as the ""Axis of Resistance,"" which includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
On Tuesday, Israel targeted a senior commander of Hezbollah on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Israel blamed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr for a rocket attack on Saturday that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Mohamed Ali al-Houthi of the Supreme Political Council in Yemen said the “unacceptable political murder” of Haniyeh would “lead to further escalation of tensions.” Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched repeated attacks on Red Sea shipping in response to the war in Gaza and recently claimed responsibility for a drone strike in Tel Aviv that killed one person.
Haniyeh's assassination comes after tensions between Israel and Iran surged this year, with Israeli forces carrying out a strike within Iran after the Islamic Republic retaliated with missiles and drones for an attack that destroyed its consulate in Syria, killing top commanders and military advisers in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 
Israel has also been blamed for a yearslong assassination campaign against Iranian nuclear scientists.  
Haniyeh's death could deal a serious blow to efforts to free hostages captured on Oct. 7 and earlier. 
“How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?” Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who has been trying to broker a cease-fire agreement, asked in a post on X.
While the United States, Israel's biggest arms supplier (Congress passed a military aid package including $14 billion just a few months ago), did not criticize Israel or blame it for the attack, Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the importance of negotiations.
""I can tell you that the imperative of getting a cease-fire, the importance that that has for everyone, remains,"" he told journalists in Singapore, adding that it was ""vitally important to help"" Palestinians in Gaza as well as to get the hostages home.
Blinken, who said the U.S. wasn’t involved in or aware of the attack beforehand, added that officials had been focused on trying to make sure that the war in Gaza doesn’t ""escalate."" 
""The best way to bring the temperature down everywhere is  through cease-fire in Gaza,"" he said.
Blinken also spoke with Al Thani after the news of the attack emerged, and ""emphasized the importance of continuing to work to reach a ceasefire,""  according to spokesperson Matthew Miller.
In a statement shared with NBC News, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents families of those held by Hamas, said it was too ""early to determine"" what the implications of the latest development might be. 
It added: ""We continue to urge the international community and the Israeli government to do everything in its power to secure the deal and bring back all 115 hostages.”
In spite of the careful language from the family forum, there are growing fears that the Haniyeh assassination will imperil ongoing efforts to negotiate a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that would bring an end to a war that has devastated Gaza, where more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to local health officials. 
The attack against Haniyeh ""obviously will postpone if not significantly disrupt this process,"" Saab, of Chatham House, said. ""You just don't kill top leadership of your opponent while engaging in peace negotiations with them.""
Already, months of negotiations have failed to produce a deal to end the war, which Israel launched after Palestinian fighters killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage on Oct. 7, or offer much hope to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Palestinians who have endured more than nine months of war.

NBC_27,Florida school staffer suspended for allowing trans daughter on girls volleyball team,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/florida-school-staffer-suspended-allowing-trans-daughter-girls-volleyb-rcna164453,2024-08-01 00:00:02.623376,,"A staffer at a Florida high school was suspended Tuesday after a county school board said she allowed her transgender daughter to play on a girls sports team in violation of state law. 
The School Board of Broward County voted 5-4 to suspend Jessica Norton from her job as a computer information specialist at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek — a city about 15 miles north of Fort Lauderdale — after she permitted her trans daughter to play on the school’s varsity volleyball team last year. 
Norton, who has worked for Broward County Public Schools for seven years, was suspended from her job without pay for 10 days. Norton avoided termination, which was recommended by the district’s superintendent, Howard Hepburn.
“I mean, obviously I don’t want to get fired from my job, I love my job, but I don’t think the decision for any suspension was correct,” Norton said after Tuesday’s board meeting, according to NBC South Florida. 
Broward County Public Schools did not immediately return a request for comment.
The school board found that Norton violated Florida’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, a 2021 law that forbids trans girls and women from competing on school sports teams that match their gender identities. 
“She knew what the law was, she made a decision not to follow the law, and that needs to have consequence to it,” school board member Debbie Hixon said during the meeting.
Norton’s suspension concludes a monthslong controversy over her daughter’s participation on her high school’s girls volleyball team.
In November, the district reassigned Norton and Monarch High School’s principal, assistant principal and athletic director to nonschool sites over the matter. Their reassignments prompted hundreds of students to stage walkouts and hold demonstrations in support of Norton’s daughter. 
Officials then fined Monarch High School $16,500 in December and placed the high school on probation for a full calendar year. The Florida High School Athletic Association also barred Norton’s daughter from participating in any of the state’s school sports teams for approximately one year.
The teenager, now 16, left Monarch High School in November and has since been enrolled in an online school. 
“Nobody can understand what we’ve been through. We’ve been through death threats, harassing phone calls, letters sent to our house, and this was all because something that they did, it wasn’t something that I did,” Norton said. “I was protecting my child. Again, I did nothing wrong.”
Florida is one of 26 states that have measures  limiting trans participation in school sports in some capacity, according to LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project.
Norton and her daughter sued Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Broward County School Board and several other Florida officials over the law in 2021. The lawsuit remains pending.

NBC_28,Kathie Lee Gifford reveals she was hospitalized with fractured pelvis after falling,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kathie-lee-gifford-reveals-was-hospitalized-fractured-pelvis-falling-rcna164516,2024-08-01 00:00:02.623376,,"Kathie Lee Gifford is recovering after falling and suffering a fractured pelvis.
The former ""TODAY"" show co-host told People that she was hospitalized for over a week after she fell. She said that she’d moved “300 books by myself” during book signings in Nashville and “weakened her body.”
“It’s my own fault,” Kathie Lee, 70, said, sharing that the following day, a friend picked her up and as she hurried out the door, she “just tripped” and fractured her pelvis in two places.
TODAY.com has reached out to Kathie Lee for comment.
The fall and hospitalization comes as she has also been recovering from a recent hip replacement surgery.
“It didn’t take much, because I was weak in that spot,” Kathie Lee told the magazine. “And the next thing you know, I am back in the hospital with a fractured pelvis: the front and the back. That’s more painful than anything I went through with the hip. The pelvis is unbelievably painful. But anyway, here I am.”
She said that she decided to stay in the hospital for a full week for physical therapy because she didn’t “trust myself.”
“You think you know your body and the next thing you know, your body changes when you get older,” she said. “And as much as I don’t wanna think about it, I am.”
Calling it a “humbling experience,” she added that she will have to stay indoors this summer.
“It’s summer for everybody but me,” she said. “But it’s OK. I’m going to get out to my little farm one of these days and stick my feet in my salt pool. The Lord is telling me it’s time to slow down. I’ve been running my whole life. The Lord is telling me, ‘You’ve planted a gazillion roses. Try smelling them.’”
Just two weeks prior, before revealing her pelvis fracture, Kathie Lee told Hoda Kotb in a July 17 ""TODAY"" show appearance about the “agonizing pain” she was in before she underwent hip replacement surgery.
“They had been looking for the problem in my spine. They finally found out what it was, and by that time, I’d been in such agonizing pain,” she recalled. “My doctor finished the surgery, came in to tell me it went beautifully, and then he said, ‘Kathie, how have you been existing all this time? (You had) some of the worst hips I’ve ever seen.’”
At the time, Kathie Lee was promoting her new book, “Herod and Mary,” as well as spoke about the “joy” of spending time with her two children and three grandchildren.
“It’s so joyful to see your children marry the people they love,” she told Hoda and Jenna Bush Hager. “And then build a family of their own, and then share their families, and they let me come and visit in my own house.”
In an additional conversation with TODAY.com, Kathie Lee fawned over the way her family resembled her late husband, Frank Gifford, whom she was married to for 29 years before his death in 2015.
“They all have the Frank Gifford chin,” she said of her kids and grandkids. “It’s unbelievable. They’ve got the cleft. The DNA strain from Frank Gifford is strong. It’s very, very strong. And he was one of the most gorgeous men that God ever made. So of course my children are much more beautiful than anybody else’s. Goes without saying.”"
NBC_29,Why orange juice is so expensive,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/orange-juice-expensive-rcna164508,2024-08-01 00:00:02.623376,,"U.S. orange production has plummeted as the industry faces volatile threats from extreme weather events, an incurable disease and economic pressures.
Citrus growers are losing millions of dollars every year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. 
At the same time, orange juice futures have hit record highs.
“Citrus production in the United States [is a] pretty dire situation right now,” Daniel Munch, economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, told CNBC. “When you have a lack of supply that’s unable to meet demand, prices for consumers shoot up.” 
Florida has seen a dramatic orange production decline in recent years. According to the USDA, there were over 658,000 orange acres in Florida in 1998. As of 2023, there were just over 303,000 acres of oranges planted in Florida, or a total acreage drop of more than 50% in just 25 years.
A large part of the problem can be traced to the spread of citrus greening disease, which is considered to be one of the most serious plant diseases in the world that is currently incurable.
“When citrus greening starts to enter the grove, it reduces the productivity of those trees, ultimately forcing them into death, and then therefore removal from the grove,” Amy O’Shea, CEO of Invaio Sciences, an agricultural sciences company, told CNBC.
The problems plaguing citrus production are not easily remedied as climate change has made extreme weather more common and scientists have yet to come up with scalable citrus greening treatments.
Some of the key research areas include fruit breeding for citrus greening-resistant varieties, antimicrobial treatments and other pest control solutions, like crop covers. 
Invaio is one of the companies researching and developing treatments for citrus greening.
“We’ve developed a very unique precision delivery technology called Trecise, that we’re able to insert into the tree and deliver a very reduced amount of an antimicrobial, “O’Shea told CNBC.
When Trecise is inserted into a tree, the active ingredient goes into its vascular system as opposed to being applied outside of the tree, according to O’Shea.
In August 2023, Invaio’s Trecise received emergency approval for use from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Community Services.
The volatility of these threats may cut into citrus harvest expectations, which leads experts to believe that higher prices for orange juice are likely to remain, at least in the short term. Andrea Miller is a video journalist for CNBC Digital Video, reporting on economics, commodities and agriculture on the Markets and Politics team."
NBC_30,"Private payroll growth slowed to 122,000 in July, less than expected, ADP says",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/private-payroll-growth-slowed-122000-july-less-expected-adp-says-rcna164503,2024-08-01 00:00:02.623376,,"Private job growth slowed further in July while the pace of wage gains hit a three-year low, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.
Companies added just 122,000 jobs on the month, the slowest pace since January and below the upwardly revised 155,000 in June. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a gain of 150,000.
ADP also reported that wages for those who stayed in their jobs increased 4.8% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2021 and down 0.1 percentage point from June.
“With wage growth abating, the labor market is playing along with the Federal Reserve’s effort to slow inflation,” said ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. “If inflation goes back up, it won’t be because of labor.”
Futures tied to major stock indexes added to gains following the report while Treasury yields fell.
There was more positive inflation news Wednesday, as the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Services reported that the employment cost index, an indicator Fed officials watch closely, increased just 0.9% in the second quarter, according to seasonally adjusted figures.
That was below the 1.2% acceleration in the first quarter and the Dow Jones estimate for a 1% increase.
Both reports could add to the likelihood that the Fed will signal a September rate cut when it concludes its two-day meeting later in the day.
Job growth was heavily concentrated in two sectors — trade, transportation and utilities, which added 61,000 workers, and construction, which contributed 39,000. Other sectors seeing gains included leisure and hospitality (24,000), education and health services (22,000) and other services (19,000).
Several sectors reported net losses on the month. They included professional and business services (-37,000), information (-18,000) and manufacturing (-4,000). Companies that employ fewer than 50 people also registered a loss, down 7,000 in June.
Geographically, the job gains were concentrated in the South, which saw a gain of 55,000, while the Midwest added just 17,000..
The ADP report comes two days before the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Services releases its nonfarm payrolls count, which, unlike the ADP tally, includes government jobs. The two reports can differ substantially, with ADP overshooting the BLS estimate of 136,000 for private payrolls in June.
Economists expect job growth of 185,000 in July, down from 206,000 in June, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1%.Jeff Cox is a finance editor with CNBC.com where he covers all aspects of the markets and monitors coverage of the financial markets and Wall Street.

NBC_31,Why a landmark kids online safety bill that just passed the Senate is still deeply divisive,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/will-kosa-coppa-20-controversial-bills-explained-rcna163243,2024-08-01 02:03:02.984399,,"On Tuesday, the Senate passed a pair of bills that could drastically change how the government regulates tech companies and child safety.
The bills, called the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0), passed with a strong bipartisan consensus, 91-3.
Despite the support from the Senate, the legislation — aimed at empowering the Federal Trade Commission to better protect American kids’ privacy and safety online — remains deeply divisive within the tech community and among various interest groups.  
The bills, which have been floated in various forms for years, now stand a greater chance than ever before to become law. While the House has recessed until September, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters Thursday that he would support KOSA. President Joe Biden appears likely to sign the bills after calling for bipartisan legislation to protect kids’ online safety and privacy online in his State of the Union speech.
While COPPA has been broadly celebrated as an overdue improvement to the country’s meager digital privacy protections, KOSA has been mired in controversy for years.
COPPA 2.0 has faced few critics outside of the advertising industry. It updates a 1998 law that tried to set baseline privacy protections for American children by prohibiting websites from knowingly collecting information on children 12 or younger without their parents’ permission. Since it took effect in 2000, the FTC has settled several dozen lawsuits with companies that it alleged collected or stored basic information on children such as their names, ages, addresses and personal interests without parental consent.
The updated COPPA has three key changes. 
It would raise the maximum age of children covered under the law to 17, banning companies from collecting those users’ data without their consent. 
It updates the law’s definition of personal information to include biometric indicators such as fingerprints, voiceprints, facial imagery and gait, to better address how technology tracks people in 2024. 
It also aims to close a loophole that allows some companies to track kids if they can claim they don’t have “actual knowledge” that their customers are underage.
COPPA 2.0 might not lead to immediate and obvious changes at major sites that serve content to kids, such as YouTube and TikTok, according to experts. Those companies already have large legal teams to assist with COPPA compliance and could simply shift age restrictions up based on the new rules in order to restrict content for teenagers or secure necessary data permissions.
But provisions in the bill could limit how third-party companies advertise to anyone under 17. COPPA 2.0 includes a ban on so-called contextual advertising to young users, forbidding companies from using certain personalized data, such as a person’s phone location or web-surfing history, to send tailored ads to most minors, said Suzanne Bernstein, a law fellow specializing in data protection and consumer privacy at the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center.
“If you were on an Instagram page for horses and you were looking through, if there was an ad on that page for stables nearby, that’s contextual advertising,” she said.
Arielle Garcia, director of intelligence for Check My Ads, a nonprofit watchdog that monitors harms from the digital advertising industry, said that the update is “necessary for COPPA to be effective.” 
Some privacy advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, haven’t endorsed COPPA 2.0 because they prefer prioritizing a comprehensive digital privacy bill for all Americans — not just kids. Different members of Congress have for years tried to get a full privacy bill passed, with no success to date. 
The Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade association, has claimed that COPPA 2.0 will make it harder to accurately serve online ads that help power free internet services, ultimately “creating a data-poor, much less functional, useful internet.” 
KOSA has garnered both significant support and heavy criticism since it was first introduced in 2022.
KOSA aims to address parents’ complaints that social media feeds can harm children’s health, from internet addiction to abuse. The bill’s core concept is creating a “duty of care” for internet companies, meaning they can be legally liable if they recommend content to kids that can harm their mental health.
It’s supported by a broad range of children’s advocacy and mental and physical health groups, such as the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Eating Disorders Coalition and Mental Health America. 
But tech policy experts and many of the bill’s public critics have said that if the bill becomes law, social media platforms may potentially react by proactively overcensoring controversial content. Critics have also raised concerns about how the potential law could be used for political censorship by future presidential administrations who might have interests in blocking information about topics such as reproductive health and LGBTQ issues. 
Experts have warned of an unintended consequence: that it could make it harder for kids and adults alike to find information online. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's analysis of KOSA says that some websites might implement age verification or simply block content on sensitive topics to avoid potential lawsuits.
Critics like the Open Technology Institute, an arm of the New America think tank, have long cautioned that existing age verification methods are often easily circumvented and can create a data trail that could be used to unnecessarily identify children online.
KOSA has weathered two major controversies that have amplified concerns around the measure. Last year, a video interview surfaced where the bill’s Republican sponsor, Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, said in a short interview that also addressed KOSA that conservative legislators should prioritize “protecting minor children from the transgender in this culture.” Blackburn’s staff later said those comments were not meant to reflect KOSA.
An earlier version of the bill originally authorized state attorneys general, who have broad discretion to pursue partisan goals, to use KOSA to sue tech companies for content they make available to minors. That caused an outcry among civil liberties advocates, who viewed it as an avenue for Republicans to censor LGBTQ and other content.
The bill now gives the FTC, rather than state attorneys general, that power to sue tech companies over content. But critics note that even the FTC, which is traditionally staffed by a 3-2 majority from the president’s party, can be partisan.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a leading civil libertarian on tech issues in the Senate, announced on a BlueSky thread Thursday that while the bill had “improved,” he would still vote no because “a future MAGA administration could still use this bill to pressure companies to censor gay, trans and reproductive health information.”
India McKinney, director of federal affairs at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which opposes KOSA, said that while that change is welcome, the bill still fundamentally blames internet companies for larger societal problems and will result in a more censored internet.
“I am not prepared to argue that there is not a mental health crisis for teens in the United States. But I don’t think Instagram is the cause of that,” McKinney said.
“I think the cause is all of the absolutely ridiculous stuff that’s happening in the world, like the Dobbs decision, climate change, the Covid pandemic. These are the things we need to be talking about as a way to help our teenagers, not restricting their access to information,” she said.Kevin Collier is a reporter covering cybersecurity, privacy and technology policy for NBC News."
NBC_32,"After private equity takes over hospitals, they are less able to care for patients, say top medical researchers",https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/private-equity-takes-over-hospitals-less-able-care-patients-jama-rcna164497,2024-08-01 02:01:02.984399,,"After private-equity firms acquire hospitals, the facilities’ assets and resources diminish significantly, leaving the facilities less equipped to care for patients, according to a new study by physician researchers at the University of California at San Francisco, Harvard Medical School and the City University of New York’s Hunter College.
Published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the research highlights a pattern of asset stripping at health care facilities purchased by private-equity firms, its researchers said, and is the first study to analyze the activity nationwide. 
“It’s a very striking finding and should change the way people think about private equity in hospitals,” said Dr. Stephanie Woolhandler, a distinguished professor of public health at Hunter, part of CUNY, and one of seven authors of the study. “The PE firms say, ‘We bring new capital into hospitals.’ It turns out that’s not quite true.”
Assets studied in the research consist of land, buildings, major hospital equipment and information technology. The study found that during the two years after a private-equity acquisition, total capital assets at private equity-acquired hospitals declined by 15% on average while assets rose by an average of 9% at other hospitals. That makes for a net difference of 24%, the researchers found, equivalent to a loss of $28 million in total assets per hospital.
The research studied 156 hospitals acquired by private-equity firms from 2010 to 2019 comparing them with 1,560 hospitals of similar size in similar communities that were not bought by private equity. The pattern of diminished assets persisted and widened five years after acquisition, the study reported.
Depleted assets translate to a reduced level of care, Woolhandler told NBC News, noting that equipment, buildings and technology are resources needed for patient care. “There are real dangers to the health care that people get if you deplete all the capital from a hospital,” she added.
Private-equity firms borrow money to buy companies that they hope to sell in a few years at a profit. Independent academic research shows that such leveraged buyouts result in far more bankruptcies than acquisitions that do not use so much debt and the deals can result in significant job losses for rank-and-file workers.
Health care has been a primary focus of private-equity purchases in recent years, with over $500 billion invested in the industry by firms such as Apollo Global Management, The Blackstone Group, The Carlyle Group and KKR. The American Investment Council, the industry lobbying group, says private equity improves health care. 
But increased patient falls and infections follow private-equity takeovers of hospitals, recent research shows, and residents of nursing homes owned by private-equity firms experience 10% greater mortality rates than those owned by other types of entities.
“Previous studies have found that patients are endangered and costs increase in the wake of private-equity acquisitions,” said Dr. Elizabeth Schrier, a resident physician at the University of California, San Francisco, and a lead author of the new research.
The report on asset-stripping in private equity-owned hospitals comes amid the collapse of Steward Health Care, a hospital chain recently owned by private equity that filed for bankruptcy in May, leaving patients and workers at 31 facilities adrift. Last week, the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee announced an investigation into the Steward crisis. 
Until 2020, Steward was owned by Cerberus Capital, a private-equity firm led by Steve Feinberg. In 2010, Cerberus bought a nonprofit chain known as Caritas Christi Health Care for around $250 million. The firm and its investor partners reaped an $800 million profit when it divested a decade later.
Along the way, Steward sold the land under its hospitals, generating a gain for investors but increasing the company’s costs significantly.
A Cerberus spokesman said in a statement that it’s unfair and incorrect to characterize the Steward land sale as “looting” the company, as Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Massachusetts Democrats, have done. “During our nearly 11-year ownership of Steward, we supported the revitalization of failing community hospitals into a leading healthcare system,” the statement continued. “Cerberus’ long-term investment made it possible for Steward to continue to serve its communities, employ tens of thousands of professionals, and positively impact millions of patients’ lives.”
Amid rising numbers of health care takeovers by private equity, at least 10 states are ramping up scrutiny on the transactions to prevent patient harm, such as rising health care costs or the effects of monopolization. On July 1, Indiana began requiring that private-equity partnerships proposing transactions with health care companies valued at $10 million or more to notify the state’s attorney general 90 days before the proposed deal. While approval of the transaction is not mandatory, the attorney general can analyze antitrust concerns or issue a civil investigative demand for more information.
California, Connecticut, Illinois and Nevada are among the other states enacting new laws bringing scrutiny to private equity’s health care acquisitions.
Health care is not the only industry in which some private-equity owners have stripped companies’ assets. The Red Lobster restaurant chain failed in part because its private-equity owner sold off the company’s prime real estate, generating gains for itself. Meanwhile, Red Lobster had to pay rent on the properties, raising its costs and ultimately hobbling its operations.Gretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit. A former stockbroker, she won the Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for her ""trenchant and incisive"" reporting on Wall Street."
NBC_33,How Chinese American women are at the intersection of the pressure to be thin,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-american-women-family-culture-pressure-body-size-rcna163719,2024-08-01 02:00:02.984399,,"There’s a lot traditionally passed down through Asian families: values, traditions, language. Pressure to be thin also seems to be on the list for Asian American women. 
Take, for instance, the Reddit discussion titled “Asian moms and their terrible body image issues.” 
“I was always told that I was too fat, but at the same time my mom shows her love through food and is always shoving food at me,” a user wrote. Then there’s the Cold Tea Collective, which published an article with tips for dealing with fat-shaming in an Asian family. Thick Dumpling Skin on Tumblr shares blog posts about body image, offering a place for “hungry Asian voices to be heard.”
A new study released Wednesday by PLOS ONE examines those deep-rooted East Asian body standards, as well as the pressure Western social media puts on white women when it comes to body image. The study assessed women’s positive feelings about their bodies and found that both Chinese and white Western women idealize thin bodies significantly more than Black Nigerian women.
These groups, specifically, were surveyed to capture globally diverse experiences and represent people who aren’t always included in existing research, the study says.
The study also found that Chinese women reported feeling pressure about their appearance from family members and that white Western women reported feeling that pressure from social media. While the study doesn’t examine Chinese American women in particular, the findings suggest that the pressures may be twofold for the group.
“You almost would have it bad from both ways,” Louise Hanson, one of the authors of the study, told NBC News.
Scarlett Hao, a Chinese plus-size fashion influencer who moved to the U.S. as a teenager, said that when she was young, pressure from family members, teachers and peers led her to intense dieting and struggles with her body image. She said Chinese beauty standards haven’t changed.
“I feel the beauty standard is not catching up with how the society and environment changes nowadays,” Hao said. “People keep the old beauty standard. That’s why everyone is still using the old standard to judge you.”
Hanson said one reason Chinese women feel the most pressure from family members and peers may be that East Asian families tend to eat meals together more than others. As a result, Chinese women are more likely to have conversations about things like portion size with their families, leading to lower levels of body appreciation.
However, peer pressure doesn’t arise just through direct comments — the way family members and friends act can also affect a woman’s sense of body appreciation. “If you have a friend who comments about their own body — for example, they say ‘I’m eating so much today’ in a negative way — then that influences you, as well,” Hanson said.
The study suggests that the cultural value of thinness is intergenerational in Chinese culture. Chinese women reported thin ideal internalization throughout their lifetimes, whereas white Western women’s view of thinness as ideal diminished as they got older.
Research has also found that the Chinese idealization of thinness is connected to the belief that meeting that ideal has socioeconomic benefits, such as attracting male partners, a phenomenon Hanson called “body as currency.”
A Reddit user said body shaming by Asian parents was “unsolicited advice.” “I think deep down it’s at least somewhat tied to the idea of filial piety (they gave you life and expect you to be beholden to them and their opinions),” the user wrote.
For Chinese women living in the West, pressure from both peers and the media may come together to reinforce thinness as the ideal. White Western women reported feeling significantly higher pressure from the media, as well as the lowest body appreciation among all groups.
Still, Hanson said, one surprising result of the study was that while Chinese women reported the most pressure overall, they still appreciated their bodies more than white Western women did.
Hao said that when she first started using social media in the U.S. in 2015, she was welcomed into an inclusive online community of plus-size women. She said the U.S. market catered to plus-size women much more than in China, where she could never find fashionable clothes in her size. “Once you are over a certain size, there’s not many options. You’ve got to wear very basic and normal ugly clothes,” she said.
Now, however, Hao feels that post-Covid, a renewed focus on health in the U.S. has resulted in a narrative that being plus-sized is unhealthy.
The PLOS ONE study also found that Nigerian women have the highest levels of body appreciation. Nigerian women experience far less thin idealization than white Western and Chinese women, with the ideal body size in several African countries being larger than that of China and in the West.
However, Hanson said, Western media is changing the global ideal. “There definitely is this introduction of Western media, and as that spreads, the ideal body globally is becoming thinner,” she said.
For Nigerian American women, the idealized thin American body type contradicts Nigerian beauty standards. Hanson said that Nigeria has a more body positive culture overall and that African values that promote fuller bodies act as a “protective factor” against negative body image.
Nigerian American women who encounter the glorification of thinness in Western media, however, could begin to experience media and peer pressure that isn’t as common in Nigerian society.
“It’s just through exposure, that you’re walking down the street and you’re seeing adverts of these models who are very thin,” she said. “No matter how protective your family is, it does influence you.”Isabel Yip is an intern for NBC News. "
NBC_34,Two Indian American stars of Broadway's 'Aladdin' trace their roles back to middle school,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/broadway-aladdin-indian-american-stars-rcna164520,2024-08-01 02:00:02.984399,,"Some years ago, when Sonya Balsara and Adi Roy were in middle school, they were cast in kiddie versions of the musical “Aladdin.” Little did they know it would be very good preparation — for the same roles on Broadway.
More than a decade after hitting their marks in the show as pre-teens, Balsara is playing plucky Princess Jasmine and Roy is the show’s urchin-turned-titular hero now on Broadway as the Disney hit musical celebrates its 10th anniversary.
“I think about that little girl who had a little speck of a dream to do all of this,” says Balsara. “If she could see what we did now, I think that she would be just beyond elated.”
Both actors are of Indian heritage and in their 20s. They both grew up in music-filled homes, attended New York University and put in long hours to prepare for this big moment. How big? Their faces are on billboards in Times Square.
“That’s every immigrant parent’s dream — their son or daughter or children are doing something like that,” says Roy. “I can only hope to keep making them proud.”
Balsara grew up in the Bay Area, with classical music playing even while she was in the womb.
Her mother is a professional classical singer who sang Baroque arias, Bach and Mozart while pregnant. Her dad is a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California who plays in a rock band and sings Pink Floyd, the Beatles and Steely Dan.
At her house, rock, classical and Bollywood were all played. So, it was no surprise that she was directing, producing, casting — and starring, naturally — in her own production of “Oklahoma!” in the fourth grade.
“It was always very encouraged to explore, and I was very encouraged, luckily, to explore what my personal passions were and dive deeper into them,” she says.
At age 11 at a local children’s theater program, she was cast as a braces-wearing Jasmine in “Aladdin Jr.” She provided part of her own costume, and the set’s flying carpet for “A Whole New World” was someone holding a cloth on sticks. No matter.
“That is what theater is made of — it’s the creativity.”
A fateful moment came when she was a sophomore in high school and was being driven by her dad to A.P. Bio lab at 6:30 a.m. He suggested she had to make a choice — acting or a more conventional route.
“I was like, ‘If I don’t give acting in theater a shot, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.’ That was sort of like a turning page for me,” she says.
Balsara took acting classes in San Francisco on Saturday mornings, then graduated NYU, went on auditions and worked at a law firm during the day and finally booked her first professional theater gig: Maria in “West Side Story” in Tokyo.
She auditioned multiple times for Jasmine on Broadway and finally got the gig on her third or fourth attempt. She’s been Broadway’s fourth full-time princess since January 2023.
Now, when she flies, she uses a harness and really flies.
Roy’s path to Broadway was more circuitous. He landed the role of Ali on tour after about six auditions and hit the road in the fall of 2022 for 20 months, visiting more than 60 different cities, like Toronto, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.
“I love to key into the joy that Aladdin brings,” he says. “Even in his saddest of times, there is a twinge of joy. He’s always trying to be that person that brings everyone up.”
Roy grew up in New Jersey, and it was his older sister who was always playing show tunes. She introduced him to one of his favorite shows, “Hadestown,” when it popped up in London.
Their home was also filled with music, so he got Bollywood movies at dinner, pop tunes with friends and show tunes at school. “I got a little bit of everything,” he says. He attended theater camps, like one at the Paper Mill Playhouse.
He would take the bus to Broadway to see shows like “Kinky Boots” with Brendon Urie, Jake Gyllenhaal in “Sea Wall/A Life” and “Hadestown” for his 17th birthday. He landed an agent, attended NYU until switching to an online school while he toured and made his Broadway debut in “Jagged Little Pill.”
After learning he’d been picked to be the fifth full-time Aladdin on Broadway, Roy began shadowing the outgoing Prince Ali — Michael Maliakel — and adjusting to the New Amsterdam Theatre.
His first night was a blur: “I was just so excited to be there and happy to do it, that I just kind of let the adrenaline take me. And, thankfully, the show happened — I think it happened.”
While on tour, Roy, was mindful that “Aladdin” was likely the first live stage show for any number of children in the audience.
“This could be the moment that a kid falls in love with theater, and, in 10 years, they might join us on stage in another show or this show,” he says. “Who knows?”
Balsara says she looks out into the audience and tries to connect with any kids in the first five or six rows, knowing the show might be extra special for them. She also meets fans at the stage door.
“People tell you, ‘You changed my life today.’ I’ve had that happen more often than you could imagine,” she says. “Indian families come to the stage door and say, ‘To see you on stage means that my kid can do anything.’”
Balsara has become friends with other “Aladdin” princesses, like Courtney Reed, the original Broadway Jasmine, who gave her tips she still remembers.
“There’s a sisterhood. It’s a unique experience,” she says. She can’t wait to increase that sisterhood when it’s time to welcome a new princess. “I’ll give the tiara to the next, and it’ll be beautiful when that moment gets to happen.”
It might even be to someone with experience from middle school."
NBC_35,Far-right exploits U.K. knife attack at Taylor Swift-themed party,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/far-right-taylor-swift-stabbings-misinformation-protests-rcna164551,2024-08-01 03:35:02.811621,,"After three young girls were fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event, a torrent of false claims from an online ecosystem of far-right extremists spread across the social media platform X, coinciding with a night of racist street violence spreading fear in an already-grieving English town.
A large group of far-right mostly white men threw bottles and bricks at police officers and a local mosque in the northwest town of Southport on Tuesday night. Some 20 officers were injured, and a police van was torched as the crowd chanted racist slogans against immigrants and Islam.
It is an unedifying pivot in a country that had been largely united in disbelief and sadness by the events of the day before. Rather than respectful mourning, the narrative was now centered around the hijacking of a vigil by extremists promoting a lie — that the attacker was an asylum-seeker, Muslim or both. It also risked puncturing the sense that Britain, which just weeks ago delivered the moderate center-left government of Prime Minister Keir  Starmer in a colossal parliamentary landslide, had managed to evade the hard right and anti-immigrant turn taken by some countries on the continent.
Police arrested a 17-year-old on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. The suspect was born in the Welsh capital of Cardiff and had lived for years in a village near Southport itself, police said. 
But there was much the police did not say, partly owing to the suspect’s age, as well as strict media rules in Britain around arrests and prosecutions. Into this vacuum stepped a thriving trade of willful falsehoods — some of it by anonymous influencers but much of it from well-known public figures.
Online personalities such as internet influencer Andrew Tate and the British former boxer Anthony Fowler asserted that the person was an illegal immigrant or from Syria. 
And newly elected British lawmaker Nigel Farage — an ally of former President Donald Trump — was also accused of emboldening these voices by asking if police were withholding the truth about the killings from the public.
“I don’t know, but I think that’s a fair and legitimate question,” he said in a video message. “What I do know is that something is going horribly wrong in our once beautiful country.”
Farage, a well-known right-wing personality who is the head of Reform UK, a new party that won five seats in Parliament largely on an anti-immigrant platform, was condemned by a former senior police officer who was in charge of counterterrorism.
Neil Basu told the Guardian that Farage was emboldening the English Defense League, which was once a potent far-right organization but today is more a decentralized network of supporters and values.
“Nigel Farage is giving the EDL succor, undermining the police, creating conspiracy theories, and giving a false basis for the attacks on the police,” Neil Basu told the newspaper.
“Has Nigel Farage condemned the violence? Has he condemned the EDL? Fomenting discord in society is what these people seem to exist for,” he added.
Disinformation and misinformation about Tuesday’s attack spread quickly on X and fueled the violence, according to disinformation expert Marc Owen Jones, an adjunct professor at Northwestern University in Qatar. There were 27 million impressions “for posts stating or speculating that the attacker was Muslim, a migrant, refugee or foreigner,” he said. 
“There is a clear attempt to exploit the tragic incident by right wing influencers and grifters, pushing an anti-immigrant and xenophobic agenda despite there being no evidence,” Jones wrote in a thread an X explaining his snap research.
The Liverpool Region Mosque Network also sought to contradict the online rumor mill.
“A minority of people are attempting to portray that this inhumane act is somehow related to the Muslim community,” it said on the X. “Frankly it is not, and we must not let those who seek to divide us and spread hatred use this as an opportunity.”
Tuesday night should have been focused on a peaceful vigil for the three girls who died, Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, and for the 10 others injured, including two adults who were badly wounded in their apparent attempts to protect the kids.
Instead, the spotlight has inevitably been drawn by the violence just around the corner. There did not seem to be much mourning here; some of the rioters were laughing and seemed to be enjoying the excuse to clash with authorities. Another group brought a big box of alcoholic cider.
The violence injured 22 officers —  eight suffering serious wounds — and three police dogs.
While Britain has, in the main, become less racist after a long history of colonialism, according to Sunder Katwala, director of the think tank British Future, which focuses on immigration, identity and integration, police in Britain say they have become increasingly worried in recent years about an increase in online extremism. 
This covers everything from militant antivaccine campaigners to those espousing the “great replacement theory,” which falsely suggests politicians are using immigration to try to replace white people across the West. Meanwhile, trust in public institutions, such as the police, politicians and media, has nosedived in the United Kingdom, United States and elsewhere.
And it’s from this online maelstrom of suspicion and misinformation that flare-ups such as the one in Southport emerge,  Katwala said. These online forms of communication allow these extremist viewpoints to become “more visible, more mobilized, more angry,” he said.
“It’s shrinking and fragmented but it’s also socialized online because it has spaces that belong to it where this stuff can seem normal.”Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London."
NBC_36,Can you use micellar water as dry shampoo? Experts weigh in,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/micellar-water-dry-shampoo-rcna164558,2024-08-01 03:32:02.811621,,"We don’t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do — which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often should you wash your hair and more.
Washing your hair daily is a beauty no-no, with experts saying it can lead to dry and damaged hair. Most experts say you should only wash your hair a few days a week. One of the best companions for those who don’t shampoo daily is dry shampoo. Some people even say you can use cornstarch or baking powder in a bind.
Another recent DIY dry shampoo idea that’s been trending on social media is using micellar water to soak up oil on your scalp. But does it really work? To answer this question, we asked two board-certified dermatologists for their thoughts.
SKIP AHEAD What is micellar water? | Can micellar water be used as dry shampoo? | How to use micellar water as dry shampoo? | Micellar water that can be used as dry shampoo
In recent years, micellar water has become a popular facial cleansing option. However, in our guide to washing your face, dermatologists told us that it should be used in addition to a gentle cleanser, not in place of one. Ideally, it is used on clean skin free of makeup in the morning, whereas a traditional cleanser is better used at night to remove the day’s makeup, dirt and grime. “Micellar water contains micelles which attract and trap dirt and oil,” says Dr. Kellie E. Reed, a board-certified dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology.
Though micellar water is not created specifically for hair, it does have the potential to be used to soak up grease on your scalp and strands, says Dr. Yoram Harth, a board-certified dermatologist and medical director of MDHair. “It has gentle cleansing properties that can refresh hair between washes without needing to be rinsed out.” 
Micellar water may even have some perks over dry shampoo. “Micellar water is less likely to leave residue or buildup compared to some dry shampoos, which can be beneficial for maintaining scalp health,” says Harth. “Its formulation is also generally more hydrating and less likely to cause scalp dryness.”
But just because micellar water can work as a dry shampoo, it doesn’t mean everyone should use it. Similar to dry shampoo, if you have a dry or sensitive scalp, using anything that draws away oil (your body’s natural lubrication) could be irritating. “Those with color-treated hair should also test it first, as it might affect the hair dye,” says Harth. 
There are several different types of micellar waters on the market — including scented versions, formulas for acne-prone skin and more. “If you want to try this trend, opt for gentle, fragrance-free formulas, to minimize irritations or allergies,” says Reed. “You can also look for a formula that is mattifying.” 
When applying the micellar water, avoid dumping it on your roots, which will just soak your hair. “Instead, use a cotton pad and wipe away oil from the roots,” says Reed. Remember, it’s hard to return from using too much, but you can always add more. From there, Harth suggests letting hair air dry naturally to soak up oil as it dries.

The man was arrested and charged by the NYPD after trying to take or damage license plates on two Secret Service vehicles that were providing security to Emhoff, 25, who was not injured, according to the Secret Service.
The man was identified as Harry Heymann, 45, according to a senior law enforcement official. Investigators believe Heymann likely had no idea the cars were Secret Service vehicles, or whom they were protecting, the official said. 
He damaged the license plate bracket on one vehicle and attempted to remove the license plate on another vehicle in lower Manhattan, according to the official.
Heymann has previously posted on Twitter his concerns about vehicles parking in the Tribeca neighborhood.
A Secret Service statement on the incident said Emhoff was not directly affected.
“On Tuesday afternoon, an individual approached two United States Secret Service vehicles parked in lower Manhattan and, without provocation, caused damage to the rear license plate area of both,” the statement said. 
“Secret Service Agents quickly detained the individual until local authorities arrived and placed the individual into police custody,"" the agency said. ""At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident.”

NBC_38,Trump stuns at Black journalists' conference after suggesting Kamala Harris 'became Black',https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-focuses-harris-race-black-jobs-combative-panel-black-journalists-rcna164271,2024-08-01 03:11:02.811621,,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ race took center stage in a combative back-and-forth exchange with former President Donald Trump during a panel discussion Wednesday at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago. 
“I did not know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now wants to be known as Black,” Trump said.
“I respect either one,"" he added, ""but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and she went she became Black. ... Somebody should look into that too.”
It was in response to a question about the appropriateness of some Republicans saying Harris is a “DEI hire,” a term referring to workplace policies promoting ""diversity, equity and inclusion."" It has increasingly been used by some on the right to discredit people of color with opposing political views. 
Harris, who is the Democratic Party's de-factor nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, is Indian American and Black.
ABC News’ Rachel Scott, one of the three moderators at the event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists, noted that Harris has always identified as Black, but Trump did not directly respond. 
Scott did quickly ask again if Trump thought Harris was a DEI hire, to which he said he was unsure.
“I really don’t know,” Trump said. “Could be.”
During the White House press briefing, which was happening at the same time, NBC News read Trump's comments to Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and asked her to respond. 
""As a person of color — as a Black woman who is in this position that is standing before you at this podium, behind this lectern — what he just said, what you just read out to me is repulsive. It's insulting. And you know, no one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify. That is no one's right,"" she said. 
A source close to Harris also said Trump's comments were ""painful.""
""It’s simply a lie and easily disproved,"" this person added. ""She went to Howard for Christ sake! She’s an AKA.” 
Harris attended Howard University, a historically Black college, and she was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which is a historically Black organization.
The overall panel discussion was combative throughout. Trump began the discussion by blasting Scott's question about why Black voters should trust him, calling it ""nasty"" and blaming NABJ for equipment errors that led to the event being delayed by more than 30 minutes.
""I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question so in such a horrible manner,"" Trump said, saying ABC News was a ""fake"" and ""terrible"" network. 
Trump was also asked to clarify his comments during the June presidential debate, when he said immigrants were coming to the United States and taking ""Black jobs.""
""A Black job is anybody that has a job,"" he said. ""That’s what it is. Anybody that has — they’re taking the employment away from Black people. They’re coming in, and they’re coming in, they’re invading.""

NBC_39,"Pressure mounts on Maduro, in Venezuela and abroad, to release vote results",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-elections-dispute-maduro-rcna164485,2024-08-01 03:09:02.811621,,"Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is facing mounting pressure, at home and abroad, to release evidence that would verify the results of Sunday's presidential election, which both he and his main challenger claim to have won.
Thousands of people have been protesting since Monday when  Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo González declared victory. 
It's estimated that at least 12 people have died and 92 injured as a result of the protests, according to the National Hospital Survey, a large-scale data collection organization. More than 700 people have also been detained, according to Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek Saab.
On Wednesday, Maduro told reporters his party was ready to show all of the electoral tally sheets. He asked Venezuela’s Supreme Court, which is loyal to his regime, to conduct an audit of the presidential election after the opposition challenged the result. That's the same court that banned the main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, from being on the ballot in January. González then emerged as the opposition’s surrogate candidate in May.
On Monday, election authorities loyal to Maduro declared that he had won 51% of the vote, but they have not yet released the precinct-by-precinct counts that would verify the result. At the same time, the opposition said González had won based on independent exit polls and official paper tallies collected at voting booths by party monitors on Election Day.
NBC News had access to a restricted site in which the Venezuelan opposition created what it said was ""an independent, civil society-led"" vote tabulation initiative to produce a “verifiable and scientifically accurate"" estimate of the vote count based on figures extrapolated from the official tally sheets their party monitors received on Election Day.
As of Wednesday morning, their count showed González had 66.12% of the votes, compared to 31.39% for Maduro. The count is updated as more source data is received and validated.
More than 80% of paper tally sheets from polling booths nationwide have already been accounted for, Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader, told Noticias Telemundo on Tuesday evening.
The information on the site has also been shared with foreign governments and international observers who have been monitoring Venezuela's election, López added.
The opposition also launched a public website in which Venezuelans can enter their ID numbers to see if the tallies from their precinct have already been counted, according to Machado, the driving force behind the opposition movement.
The Venezuelan government’s official election website was down for a third consecutive day on Wednesday.
González, Machado and López, all members of the opposition, insist that the release of those detailed voter tallies would show that Maduro lost the election.
The Carter Center, an independent U.S.-based institution that evaluates elections, had been invited by Venezuela's election commission to observe the presidential election on Sunday.
The organization has since been unable to verify the results, blaming election authorities for a “complete lack of transparency” in declaring Maduro the winner without providing any individual polling tallies.
Peru became the first nation to recognize González as Venezuela’s president-elect. Peruvian Foreign Minister Javier González-Olaechea accused Maduro of being “a person who wants to perpetuate himself in power through dictatorship.”
As a result, Venezuela severed diplomatic ties with Peru; Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil accused Peru of making “reckless statements ... which ignore the will of the Venezuelan people and our Constitution.” 
Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday called on Maduro, a close ally, to release polling center-level results as it is usually done in Venezuelan elections.
“The serious doubts that have arisen around the Venezuelan electoral process can lead its people to a deep violent polarization with serious consequences of permanent division,” Petro said in a post on X. “I invite the Venezuelan government to allow the elections to end in peace, allowing a transparent vote count, with the counting of votes, and with the supervision of all the political forces of its country and professional international supervision.""
On Tuesday, President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also urged Venezuela to release the vote tallies. 
Russia, Cuba, Honduras and Bolivia have accepted Maduro as the winner.

NBC_40,‘Lotus for POTUS’ energizes South Asian voters around Harris,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/lotus-potus-kamala-harris-indian-voters-rcna164323,2024-08-01 03:03:02.811621,,"Indian American voters supporting Kamala Harris’ presidential ticket have a new rallying cry: LOTUS for POTUS. 
It stems from a translation of the vice president’s first name. “Kamala” in the classical South Asian language Sanskrit means “lotus,” a flower native to the region that’s significant across many religions on the subcontinent. 
Abhay Dandekar took notice of this the Monday morning after President Joe Biden announced he was exiting the race. Between seeing patients, the 53-year-old pediatrician took out his phone and created a meme. It was Harris’ face behind white text that said, “In Sanskrit, Kamala means LOTUS. In America, Kamala means POTUS.” 
“There was just a newfound energy … mostly because of how much in common I have with Vice President Harris,” Dandekar said. “It felt like something that resonated in the moment. And in all honesty, I made that in a couple of moments before going in to see patients.” 
After he texted the meme to a few friends, it proceeded to blow up on WhatsApp groups, a town square for members of the South Asian diaspora all over the world. 
“The hyperloop of WhatsApp and social media kicked in,” he said. “I had friends who by the afternoon said, ‘I’ve gotten this in a couple of different formats and on Instagram and Twitter.’”
Some on X, formerly Twitter, gave dispatches from their family group chats, saying South Asian voters are energized by Harris’ campaign, they’re connecting to her shared identity and they’re ready to vote in November. 
A hesitant few on social media drew attention to the fact that the lotus flower conveys another powerful political message in India: It’s the symbol of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
During his address to a joint meeting of Congress last year, Modi praised Harris and invoked her Indian roots, drawing massive applause from the crowd and smiles from the vice president.  
Despite the tenuous lotus connection, others weighed in after Dandekar with graphics of their own, including the American flag superimposed onto a lotus flower with “Harris 2024” as a tagline. Within a week, merchandise began to emerge, with “Lotus for POTUS” T-shirts selling for $30 a pop to raise money for Harris’ campaign.
It’s part of a larger movement aimed at drawing in South Asian voters, who have the potential to make a significant difference in certain swing states. In Arizona, for example, the Indian American population is larger than Biden’s margin of victory in 2020. 
A new group, South Asian Women for Harris, raised over $250,000 for the campaign during a two-hour call last week, according to The Associated Press. Around 4,000 women attended, including panelists like actor Mindy Kaling and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.
Before his exit from the race, Biden had fallen by 8 points among Asian American voters from 2020 to 2024. Experts still question how Harris will fare with the demographic given her low popularity ratings as vice president. 
But 62% of Asian voters lean toward the Democratic Party, according to a Pew Research Center report published last year. And a survey of Asian American voters released in July showed Harris’ favorability is 10 points higher than former President Donald Trump’s.
“All the different elements of our diaspora and every diaspora that’s out there, they’re not monoliths and they’re not just voter blocs,” Dandekar said. “Hopefully the spirit of the Harris campaign will take that into account and find ways to build actual connection, not just through memes and not just through slogans.”

NBC_41,UAW union endorses Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/uaw-union-endorses-president-kamala-harris-trump-rcna164550,2024-08-01 03:00:02.811621,,"The United Auto Workers has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris over Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump.
The union’s endorsement shouldn’t be surprising. UAW President Shawn Fain has been outspoken against Trump. The Detroit union also has historically supported Democrats, including President Joe Biden.
It comes after Biden withdrew his re-election bid and endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee against Trump.
Fain and Trump have been at odds — publicly trading remarks — since the union leader was elected early last year. Trump called for Fain to be fired during a speech earlier this month at the Republican National Convention.
The union responded with a post calling Trump a “scab and a billionaire,” continuing “that’s who he represents. We know which side we’re on. Not his.”
Quickly after Biden dropped out of the election, the UAW praised him and showed support for Harris, who walked a picket line with union members during a strike in 2019.
“The path forward is clear: we will defeat Donald Trump and his billionaire agenda and elect a champion for the working class to the highest office in this country,” the union said in a statement July 21 after Biden had dropped out of the 2024 race. That statement stopped short of formally endorsing Harris.

NBC_42,Drag queen in Olympic opening ceremony has no regrets,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/drag-queen-olympic-opening-ceremony-last-supper-rcna164547,2024-08-01 03:00:02.811621,,"As a gay youth growing up in central France, Hugo Bardin never felt he lived in a world that represented who he was — a world in which he had a place.
And that is why Bardin, who performs as the drag queen Paloma, felt it was meaningful and important to be part of a Paris Olympics opening ceremony that presented a multifaceted, multiethnic France with people of different ethnicities and orientations.
“It was a really important moment for the French people and the representation of France around the world,” says Paloma, who took part in a single scene that has drawn some furious criticism — including from presidential candidate Donald Trump in the United States, who called it “a disgrace.”
Although the ceremony’s artistic director, Thomas Jolly, and other participants have repeatedly said the scene wasn’t inspired by “The Last Supper,” critics interpreted that part of the show as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting showing Jesus Christ and his apostles.
Paloma, best known for winning “Drag Race France,” appeared with other drag artists and dancers alongside Barbara Butch, a popular DJ who wore a silver headdress that looked like a halo. Butch has now filed a complaint alleging online abuse and harassment, and Paris police have launched an investigation.
Paloma is not, at this point, planning to take legal action over online harassment, and would prefer to focus on the many “loving messages” that have been pouring in. The performer been getting thousands of messages daily, she told The Associated Press, most of them positive but some that he described as “violent” and even “from the Middle Ages.”
Still, there are no misgivings, despite the backlash. Paloma said she was proud to have been part of a show that did not rely on a series of French cliches — for example, “the Parisian with a baguette under their arm.”
“It could have been a postcard from 1930,” she said of the ceremony. “But instead, it was a photograph of France in 2024.”
Many agreed, and praised the ceremony for its creativity, style and showmanship.
But French Catholic bishops and others were among those who said Christians had been offended, though Paris Olympics organizers have said there was “never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group” but rather to “celebrate community tolerance.”
Trump was asked on Fox News what he thought of the so-called “Last Supper” scene. “I’m very open-minded,” the former president and current Republican nominee told host Laura Ingraham, “but I thought what they did was a disgrace.”
Of Trump’s comments, Paloma said: “My first reaction is to say that if Donald Trump is not reacting, then we have not done our job.”
The criticism, she said, has been fueled by hate. “Where is the Catholicism, the Christianity in that? It is very hypocritical that their message is not about religion or kindness, it’s about hate towards Jews, fat people, queer people and trans people.”
“We have been accused of trying to impose our vision on the world,” Bardin said. “We are not. ... We just want to let people know that we have a place in the world, and we are claiming that place.”
Paloma spoke to the AP in a phone interview and later at her Paris workshop, a studio devoted to her drag performance. Bardin debuted the drag queen persona some five years ago, the Spanish name inspired by the films of Pedro Almodóvar.
Asked if she had any regrets, Paloma replied: “My only regrets is people’s reactions. I’m sorry if people are offended but we did not try to parody, to mock ‘The Last Supper.’ It was not the point. So I can’t regret what I did. I’m sorry for people to only see things in a bad way.”
She added: “Maybe change the perspective. Change the point of view. Try to see the beauty in what we did. Because it was just beauty. It was just only about beauty and reunion, and reparation.”"
NBC_43,56 days and counting: Two NASA astronauts are still in space as tests on Boeing capsule continue,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-astronauts-wait-space-station-boeing-tests-rcna164276,2024-08-01 03:00:02.811621,,"Their high-stakes mission was supposed to last about a week — but 56 days later, two NASA astronauts are still aboard the International Space Station, waiting as teams on the ground try to figure out how to bring them home safely in the Boeing spaceship they rode to orbit.
The beleaguered Starliner capsule has two problems: its propulsion system is leaking helium and five of its thrusters malfunctioned as it was docking with the ISS. Mission managers were aware of the leaks before the vehicle lifted off, but had said they were unlikely to affect the flight or the astronauts’ safety.
Over the weekend, NASA and Boeing engineers conducted a key test of the Starliner, which launched veteran astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore on the vehicle’s first crewed flight on June 5.
The “hot fire test,” as it is known, was the second such test of the Starliner’s thrusters while it has been docked at the space station. It involved firing 27 of the capsule’s 28 jets for bursts of no longer than 1.2 seconds. Engineers on the ground evaluated the thrusters’ performance one at a time and also checked the status of the helium leaks.
In a blog post published Tuesday, NASA said preliminary results were encouraging, with all of the tested thrusters performing well. 
“Both teams were very happy with the results,” Chloe Mehring, NASA’s flight director for the Starliner mission, said in a statement.
The agency also said it had verified that the Starliner’s propulsion system was stable and that helium leak rates had not increased in a way that might jeopardize a return trip to Earth. The helium system will be checked again before the Starliner capsule undocks from the space station, according to NASA.
Wilmore and Williams were seated inside the Starliner capsule during the hot fire test as part of their return preparations, NASA said.
The thrusters are crucial for maneuvering the spacecraft in orbit, such as when the capsule approaches the space station and when it backs away from the outpost during the undocking process.
The capsule's reaction control thrusters are also used to guide it into proper position before a different set of engines is fired to begin the journey out of orbit.The in-orbit Starliner tests came after weeks of work on the ground using a test engine at NASA’s White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico. Teams subjected that engine and thrusters — which were developed for future Starliner flights — to conditions similar to those that the capsule experienced on its way to the space station. Engineers also replicated conditions that the Starliner will experience as it undocks and prepares to re-enter the atmosphere.
In the coming days, NASA and Boeing officials will assess data from all the tests to date and may conduct a formal review to discuss when to bring the capsule and its astronaut crew home. 
NASA has not set a target landing date for the mission, but has said there are opportunities throughout August.Initially, NASA had set a 45-day time limit for Wilmore and Williams to stay at the space station because of constraints with the Starliner capsule’s batteries. But agency officials said earlier this month that the batteries were being recharged while the spacecraft is docked, thus lowering the risk of extending the capsule's time in orbit.
With this mission, Boeing was hoping to prove that its Starliner capsule could safely ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station — a key step before NASA can authorize the company to conduct routine flights to the orbiting outpost. Rival company SpaceX has been transporting NASA astronauts since 2020.
Starliner’s first uncrewed test flight, in 2019, also encountered problems and was cut short after software glitches prevented the capsule from attempting to dock at the space station. Subsequent fuel valve issues caused several delays before the vehicle succeeded in docking at the ISS without a crew in 2022. 
Then in the spring, the NASA astronauts’ launch was delayed twice before they finally lifted off.
Wilmore and Williams’ lengthy stay on the space station makes the orbiting outpost more crowded, but mission managers have said there are enough supplies and resources aboard to accommodate them.
As they await their return to Earth, Williams and Wilmore have been conducting science experiments and assisting with various space station duties alongside the seven crew members — four NASA astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts — who were already stationed there.
“This is a tough business that we’re in,” Wilmore said earlier this month in a news briefing from the space station. “Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with any spacecraft that’s ever been designed, and that’s the nature of what we do.”Denise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News."
NBC_44,Latest FAFSA issue could leave college students without critical aid as classes approach,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/latest-fafsa-issue-leave-college-students-critical-aid-classes-approac-rcna164467,2024-08-01 04:00:02.682843,,"Some students may be unable to receive their financial aid money in time to pay their bills, with classes only a few weeks away, after the Education Department announced Tuesday that colleges will not be able to submit corrections to financial aid records in bulk this year.
The announcement is yet another obstacle for students during what has been a turbulent rollout in the overhaul of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. Since the new form was released in December 2023, the rollout has been plagued by delays, glitches and processing errors in a system that helps millions of college students receive critically needed financial aid.
The department announced on Tuesday that “batch corrections” would be deferred until the 2025-2026 FAFSA cycle, after previously saying in June that it would be available by mid-August. 
“We know this decision creates additional burdens for institutions that are already experiencing a heavy workload and increased demands during this extraordinary FAFSA processing cycle,” it said in a statement.
The issues for students began with the application’s December launch and have included a series of glitches and formula errors in what was supposed to be a more streamlined process with more generous outcomes for some students. Instead, millions of households and campus officials have been left in bureaucratic limbo.
In April, Education Department officials disclosed that at least 30% of the FAFSA forms submitted by that time could contain errors resulting from widespread application glitches or other issues. The agency said at the time the forms would be reprocessed in the coming weeks.
In May, Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a letter to staff that the department was taking steps to improve its Federal Student Aid office after months of errors with the FAFSA application. 
Cardona said the department was conducting a “full-scale review of FSA’s current and historical organization, management, staffing, workflow structures, business processes, and operations,” as well as vendor contracts.
College institutions have previously been able to send batch corrections when FAFSA goes live, usually in October. The ability to submit corrections to financial aid applications in bulk is especially important for schools that may need to send thousands of corrected applications. 
Those corrections include assisting vulnerable students with special circumstances, including those whose parents have lost a job or have a major change in income as well as changes in dependency status and students savings.
The department said its decision to defer batch corrections was based on two factors: institutions would not be able to use them before they begin the fall semester, and because it was prioritizing developing a “well-tested, robust, and end-to-end launch of the 2025-26 form and need to ensure development resources are focused appropriately.”
It said that since launching its FAFSA Partner Portal earlier this month, more than 2,800 institutions have been able to successfully submit individual corrections. 
In its announcement, the Education Department also said it would make available no-cost technical assistance to help institutions submit corrections.
A nonprofit representing financial aid professionals said the decision was “a stunning failure.”
“The Department’s poor planning has led to a stunning failure: Some college students might not have financial aid dollars in their hands in time to start classes in the next few weeks,” Beth Maglione, the interim president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said in a statement Tuesday.
Maglione said that for schools, the impact of the announcement “means more than a few extra hours of work. It’s the difference between pushing a button versus making thousands of keystrokes in terms of administrative burden.” 
The organization has been pushing the Education Department on its new FAFSA rollout and calling for improvements and assistance. 
Maglione added that the department’s announcement “goes beyond impractical and approaches unworkable, redirecting even more time from other important tasks.”Daniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education."
NBC_45,Google announces steps to combat nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-announces-news-steps-combat-sexually-explicit-deepfakes-rcna164560,2024-08-01 04:00:02.682843,,"After a staggering increase in the number of fake pornographic videos and images uploaded online in the last several years, Google on Wednesday announced new measures to assist victims and reduce the prominence of deepfakes in top search results.
The search engine also committed to taking steps to derank websites that frequently host the nonconsensual sexually explicit fake videos — also known as deepfakes — meaning that they may appear lower in search results. Deepfakes refer to misleading fake media, which has increasingly been created using artificial-intelligence tools.
Nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes often “swap” a victim’s face onto the body of a person in a pre-existing pornographic video. Generative AI tools have also been used to create fake but realistic sexually explicit images that depict real people, or “undress” real photos to make victims appear nude. The practice overwhelmingly affects women and girls, both public figures and, increasingly, girls in middle and high schools around the world.
In 2023, more nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes were posted online than in all previous years combined. Google and other search engines have directed traffic to websites that allow deepfake creators to profit, as well as included links to deepfake videos and shown deepfake images in top search results. The platform has also included links to tools used to create nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes in top results. 
In its announcement Wednesday, Google said it will aim to filter explicit content from similar searches after victims successfully request the removal of explicit nonconsensual fake imagery through an online form. Currently, victims have to flag each URL containing the imagery. 
Google also said that it will scan for and remove duplicates of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfake images from search results after images are successfully flagged and taken down. 
“These efforts are designed to give people added peace of mind, especially if they’re concerned about similar content about them popping up in the future,” Google’s announcement said.
Google is not proactively scanning for new deepfakes to remove, and will only remove deepfakes if a victim successfully flags them. 
NBC News previously reported that when safe-search tools are turned off, results for queries like “deepfakes” and “fake nudes” would surface the material in top results, above relevant news articles about the growing trend. 
Now, Google said it aims to rank relevant news articles above deepfakes, including when someone is searching for a person’s name and the word “deepfakes.” 
“With these changes, people can read about the impact deepfakes are having on society, rather than see pages with actual non-consensual fake images,” the announcement said. 
Google also said it will also demote websites that have been associated with a high number of deepfake removal requests in search results. One of the most prominent websites for nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes, which ranks highly in some Google search results, has used a variety of tactics to monetize the material. 
“This approach has worked well for other types of harmful content, and our testing shows that it will be a valuable way to reduce fake explicit content in search results,” Google said.
The announcement follows pressure from lawmakers to address the issue. In June, Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sent a letter to Google’s CEO asking for details on how it plans to combat deepfakes. Federal legislation introduced by Durbin would allow nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfake victims to sue perpetrators; it passed the Senate last week and is awaiting a vote in the House.Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News."
NBC_46,South Korea's effortlessly cool sharpshooter becomes an unlikely Olympics star,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/kim-yeji-south-korea-sharpshooter-olympics-social-media-rcna164504,2024-08-01 04:00:02.682843,,"As fans are wowed by the impressive ballers, skaters, gymnasts and other athletes participating in the Paris Olympics, one woman in particular has emerged as a breakout star. 
Kim Ye-ji, a 31-year-old South Korean pistol shooter, has gone viral across social media this week, drawing countless new fans. While Kim took home the silver medal in the 10m air pistol women’s event on Saturday, it wasn’t all about her skill, but also her style, featuring futuristic steampunk-esque glasses and a savage demeanor, that catapulted her to internet fame. 
Some social media users praised her effortless confidence while others compared her to James Bond and character Satoru Gojo, a sorcerer in popular manga Jujutsu Kaisen.
Kim’s energy has prompted recognition from big names as well, including Elon Musk, who wrote that it would be “cool” to feature her in an action movie. But while her popularity has skyrocketed this Olympic Games, a recently unearthed clip of her performance during the International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in Azerbaijan this past May was what initially kicked off her viral fame. In it, Kim is sporting a backward cap, sharp bob, glasses and signature stone cold glare. After the event, during which she broke the world record in the women’s 25m pistol, she told reporters that there was “nothing to improve” before Paris, according to Yonhap News. “I don’t feel any pressure at all,” she told reporters. “My confidence comes from a reason. It’s confidence based on a foundation.”
This time around, the markswoman opted for a short ponytail. And though she’s been admired for her no-nonsense expression, she’s somewhat of a softy. Viewers pointed out that she competed while clutching a small stuffed elephant in her back pocket, which, according to the Olympics, belongs to her daughter. Kim also displayed her nurturing side when expressing support for teammate Oh Ye-jin, 19, who took home the gold.  “She is like my youngest sibling, and I always want to care for her and always be there for her. So, when she won the gold medal, I was extra happy,” Kim said. 
She added that she did not view Oh as her rival. 
“This is a big stage, the Olympics, and we won the gold and silver,” Kim said. “When we won these medals, we were so proud we are Koreans. I thought it did not matter who won the gold.”Kimmy Yam is a reporter for NBC Asian America."
NBC_47,"Weight loss drugs like Wegovy may trigger eating disorders in some patients, doctors warn",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/eating-disorders-increase-weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-zepbound-rcna162124,2024-08-01 04:00:02.682843,,"Over the past six months, psychologist Tom Hildebrandt has seen an increase in patients with eating disorders who are taking popular weight loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound.
“They start using this drug and next thing you know, they’ve developed what looks very much like anorexia nervosa,” said Hildebrandt, who leads Mount Sinai’s Center of Excellence in Eating and Weight Disorders in New York City.
The blockbuster medications have been hailed as wonder drugs for their profound effects on diabetes and weight loss, but a growing number of doctors are concerned that the medications are triggering or worsening eating disorders in some people.
This class of drugs, called GLP-1 drugs, which also include the diabetes drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro, work by mimicking a naturally occurring hormone released by the gut called glucagon-like peptide 1, which regulates blood sugar levels and curbs hunger. In one clinical trial, people taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s Zepbound lost 21% of their body weight. (The weight tends to return when people stop taking the drugs.)
In some cases, a person’s brain may interpret such dramatic, sudden weight loss as starvation, Hildebrandt said, making people more obsessive about food. People who are taking these new weight loss drugs, he posited, may then find themselves compelled to further limit how much food they eat, even when it endangers their health.
“The restrictive eating unintentionally spirals out of control” until people can’t help themselves, said Dr. Aaron Keshen, co-director of the Nova Scotia Eating Disorder Provincial Service in Canada and an associate professor of psychiatry at Dalhousie University. 
Experts don’t know what percentage of people taking the new class of weight loss drugs are at risk of eating disorders, because there are no published clinical trials addressing the question, said Keshen, who would like to see a rigorous study.
Misuse of over-the-counter and prescription medication, however, was common among people with eating disorders long before GLP-1 drugs came on the market. Some people with eating disorders take diet pills, which can contain appetite suppressants, caffeine or even amphetamines. Others misuse laxatives and prescription medications such as insulin and pills used to treat thyroid disorders. 
Yet in terms of the abuse of weight-loss drugs, “nothing compares to the phenomenon that we’re seeing right now with these GLP-1s,” said Melissa Spann, a psychotherapist and the chief clinical officer at Monte Nido, an eating disorder treatment group that runs 50 virtual programs in 28 states.
Because GLP-1 drugs are relatively new, there isn’t much published research on whether patients are abusing them to lose extra weight. One recent study,  based on an analysis of adverse event reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, found a greater risk of abuse among patients taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, compared to other  weight loss drugs.
People don’t need to abuse the new drugs, however, to develop eating disorders, Keshen said. He’s seen eating disorders develop in people who take the drugs as prescribed. One in eight American adults — about 30 million people — say they have taken a GLP-1 drug, according to a recent survey from KFF, a nonprofit group that researches health policy issues.
Cynthia Landrau, 28, started taking Mounjaro which contains the same active ingredient as Zepbound but is approved for diabetes, last year for obesity. She lost 30 pounds. (Landrau was not one of Keshen’s patients.)
The drug, she said, led her to stop binge eating After a few months, however, she said that she “went from one extreme to another,” restricting her diet even further, beyond what was medically recommended and  consuming only about one-third of the calories recommended for a woman her age.
“You begin to realize that you do not want to eat,” said Landrau, of Queens, New York. “You are not eating. And you are OK with that because you want to lose weight. That’s when it crosses the line” from healthy weight loss into an eating disorder, she said.
Landrau said she was in denial about the risks she was taking, even after fainting twice from low blood sugar levels. “It was very hard for me to prioritize my health over the weight loss,” she said.
The Collaborative of Eating Disorders Organizations, whose members provide treatment or support for people with disordered eating, has called for doctors to screen people for conditions such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder before prescribing the drugs for weight loss.
Landrau said no one warned her that Mounjaro could increase the risk of eating disorders. She credits her recovery and improved mental health in recent months to her psychologist, who is one of Hildebrandt’s colleagues at Mount Sinai. Although she continues to take the medication, she now spaces out the doses to prevent her appetite from disappearing. Landrau recommends that anyone who starts using obesity medication also see a mental health provider.
In a statement, Mounjaro’s manufacturer, Eli Lilly, said, “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority, and we actively engage in monitoring, evaluating, and reporting safety information for all our medicines. If someone is experiencing any side effects while taking any Lilly medication, we encourage them to speak with their healthcare provider.” 
Hildebrandt said those at the greatest risk of eating disorders related to anti-obesity drugs are people who “have an unhealthy relationship with food in your history, whether that’s eating too much, feeling out of control of your eating, having had periods where you lost weight and felt like you couldn’t get yourself to eat.”
Not all doctors, however, are seeing an increase in eating disorders among people taking GLP-1 drugs.
Anjali Uma Pandit, a gastrointestinal psychologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said that eating disorders are “not something I’m seeing frequently” among people taking the drugs.
“Our physicians are really, really cautious about their prescribing and do a very thorough intake,” Pandit said, adding that her colleagues who prescribe these drugs “sort of interview with potential patients before they’ll propose starting a medicine.”
Pandit said she’s also seen patients with binge eating disorder who have benefited from taking GLP-1 drugs.
Dr. Susan McElroy, the chief research officer at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio, which provides treatment for mental and behavioral health, and a professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, has herself prescribed them to patients for the condition.
Because the drugs reduce hunger, researchers are studying their use for the treatment of binge eating, McElroy said, though she added that there haven’t been any large, rigorous studies to prove that they work in this population.
Spann, however, said she worries that GLP-1 drugs could make the symptoms of binge eating disorder worse.
Many people combine binge eating with restricted eating, she said. Anything that helps people to limit their calorie intake will seem attractive.
“Any type of restriction and restrictive behavior is going to put somebody at risk for an eating disorder,” Spann said.
McElroy said she and her partners, who provide psychiatric treatment, screen all potential patients for eating disorders, as well as depression, anxiety and substance-use disorders.
McElroy and her colleagues published the story of a woman who abused a GLP-1 in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology. Her team first met the patient when she was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts.
The woman’s doctor had prescribed her a GLP-1 drug for weight loss, even though the woman, who had suffered from an eating disorder for 28 years, had abused numerous medications to lose weight. The woman lost 50 pounds in nine months and eventually confided that she often took more medication than prescribed “when she felt she ate too much.”
In the journal article, McElroy and her co-authors encouraged doctors to screen for eating disorders and monitor patients’ weight carefully, noting that patients like the one she described can suffer from “atypical anorexia nervosa” in which the symptoms of anorexia occur in people whose weight is above normal. The authors also noted that they’re particularly concerned about patients prescribed the drugs through large telehealth platforms, rather than through their regular doctors. 
Hildebrandt said he’s concerned that doctors aren’t adequately warning people about the potential risks of eating disorders before prescribing the medications. “Most of the people prescribing these drugs aren’t necessarily trained to assess or treat those kinds of risks,” he said. 
Some doctors are especially concerned about the potential for abuse or eating disorders in adolescents. Wegovy is approved for use in children ages 12 and up.
The prevalence of eating disorders has grown sharply in recent years. The percentage of people who develop an eating disorder at some point in life rose from 3.5% in 2000-2006 to 7.8% in 2013-2018. Among adolescents, medical visits for eating disorders spiked during the pandemic, both in outpatient clinics and emergency rooms.
 “We’ve seen adolescents, we’ve seen young adults, we’ve seen middle-aged folks” develop eating disorders after using a GLP-1 drug, Hildebrandt said. “It’s having a profound impact on their life in terms of disrupting the relationships that they do have.”
Eating disorders can be life-threatening. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder; about 5% of people with the condition die within four years of diagnosis.
Although the drug labels for obesity medications warn of common side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as serious side effects including suicidal thoughts, the medications carry no warning about eating disorders.
Spann said that needs to change. She would like to see drug labels warn people about the potential risk of eating disorders
Dr. Raveendhara Bannuru, vice president of medical affairs and quality improvement outcomes at the American Diabetes Association, said there’s not enough research on GLP-1 drugs to know if they increase or decrease the risk of eating disorders.
Neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the manufacturers of obesity drugs have announced any plans to update safety labels.
“Patient safety is paramount at the FDA and we continuously review available sources of data and new information on potential risks of drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, and update labeling as needed,” an FDA spokesperson said in a statement. 
Both Eli Lilly, which manufactures Zepbound and Mounjaro, and Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy, said they’re committed to safety.
In a statement, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said, “We trust that healthcare providers are evaluating a patient’s individual needs in determining which medicine is right for that patient.”
Some researchers say drug companies should make more of their data available to the public so that researchers can drill down to look for effects on eating disorders.
“The reports of eating disorders associated with these drugs raise concern and emphasize the need for independent analysis of the data,” said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who advocates for transparency in medical research and scrutinizes the evidence behind popular interventions. “We should have robust and publicly available data on the risks and benefits.”

In a statement Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission said  CarShield, which employs celebrity endorsers including rapper and actor Ice-T and sports commentator Chris Berman, had falsely lured customers with the promise of “peace of mind” and “protection” from the cost and inconvenience of vehicle breakdowns through its contracts. 
The FTC also charged American Auto Shield, LLC (AAS), the administrator of CarShield's vehicle service contracts, in the scheme. 
The agency said that at least one ad, which ran 18,000 times on television, stated, “With CarShield’s administrators, they make sure you don’t get stuck with expensive car repair bills like this.” It also touted CarShield contracts as “your best line of defense against expensive breakdowns.”
Yet many purchasers discovered that their repairs were not covered, despite making payments of up to $120 per month for CarShield's product, the FTC said. 
""Instead of delivering the ‘peace of mind’ promised by its advertisements, CarShield left many consumers with a financial headache,"" Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.  
""Worse still, CarShield used trusted personalities to deliver its empty promises,"" Levine said. ""The FTC will hold advertisers accountable for using false or deceptive claims to exploit consumers’ financial anxieties.”
Representatives for CarShield and AAS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CarShield, based in Missouri, has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau — but the company's BBB listing features more than 300 pages of complaints and a 1.6 out of 5 customer rating. A recent report from a Missouri-based news station said CarShield had sued the BBB, with the case being settled out of court.

NBC_50,Richard Simmons' family slams Pauly Shore for suggesting he didn't write his social media posts,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/richard-simmons-family-slams-pauly-shore-suggesting-didnt-write-social-rcna164542,2024-08-01 04:00:02.682843,,"The family of Richard Simmons is hitting out at actor and comedian Pauly Shore, who cast doubt on whether the late fitness icon was actually behind his own social media posts.
Simmons, a beloved figure known for his eccentric personality and workout videos, was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home on July 13, one day after his 76th birthday. His family confirmed his passing in a statement, saying: “We are in shock.”
His cause of death is under investigation pending a report from the medical examiner, Los Angeles Police said earlier this month. 
Pauly Shore made headlines for his plans to play Simmons in a biopic about Simmons’ life, developed at The Wolper Organization, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers. However, Simmons had said on social media in January that he never gave permission to Shore for the movie.
In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Shore cast doubt on whether Simmons, who became a recluse in recent years, was even behind his social media posts. 
""I know he wanted me to do it,"" he said on the biopic. ""I don’t even know if that was him tweeting the whole time. I don’t know who that was,"" Shore said.
Those comments drew ire from Simmons’ camp. 
His staff wrote on X on Wednesday: ""Pauly Shore has recently made comments to Entertainment Tonight concerning his attempts to proceed with an unauthorized movie about Richard. You’ve seen here on Richard’s account what he had to say about the biopic.""
In a following post, the account shared a statement from Simmon’s brother, Lenny Simmons, that said: “Dicky absolutely wrote his own posts.”
“He worked on them a week in advance, going over and over them to get the right message,” he said. “He would often read them to Cathy and I beforehand. What he has NOT done was to text, email or call Pauly with anything; not even to wish him 'Good Luck' as Pauly has stated many times.”
The fitness coach was known for his bubbly persona and “Sweatin’ to the Oldies” workout videos, rising to fame in the 1970s and '80s after opening gyms and making frequent appearances on television talkshows. Marlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_51,Federal protections of transgender students are launching where courts haven’t blocked them,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/federal-protections-transgender-students-are-launching-courts-havent-b-rcna164604,2024-08-01 05:45:02.817066,,"New federal protections for transgender students at U.S. schools and colleges will take effect Thursday with muted impact because judges have temporarily blocked enforcement in 21 states and hundreds of individual colleges and schools across the country.
The regulation also adds protections for pregnant students and students who are parents, and details how schools must respond to sexual misconduct complaints.
For schools, the impact of the court challenges could be a combination of confusion and inertia in terms of compliance as the academic year begins.
“I think it is likely that school district-to-school district or state-to-state, we’re going to see more or less a continuation of the current status quo,” said Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.
The rights of transgender people — and especially young people — have become a major political battleground in recent years as trans visibility has increased. Most Republican-controlled states have banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, and several have adopted policies limiting which school bathrooms trans people can use and barring trans girls from some sports competitions.
In April, President Joe Biden’s administration sought to settle some of the contention with a regulation to safeguard rights of LGBTQ students under Title IX, the 1972 law against sex discrimination in schools that receive federal money. The rule was two years in the making and drew 240,000 responses — a record for the Education Department.
The rule declares that it’s unlawful discrimination to treat transgender students differently from their classmates, including by restricting bathroom access. It does not explicitly address sports participation, a particularly contentious topic.
It also enhances protections for students who are pregnant or have children, widens the scope of the sexual misconduct cases schools must investigate, and removes a Trump administration rule requiring schools to let the accused cross-examine their accusers in live hearings.
The U.S. Department of Justice has asked the Supreme Court for permission to enforce components of the rule that were not challenged by states, but it’s not clear when the justices might rule.
Meanwhile, Title IX enforcement remains highly unsettled.
In a series of rulings, federal courts have declared that the rule cannot be enforced in most of the Republican states that sued while the litigation continues. In a ruling Tuesday, a judge in Alabama went the other way, allowing enforcement to start in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
A Kansas-based federal judge appointed by former President Donald Trump added another wrinkle, asserting power over states led by Democrats: He said the rule cannot be enforced in schools attended by the children of members of Moms for Liberty or colleges with members of Young America’s Foundation or Female Athletes United. That’s keeping the regulation from taking effect in hundreds of colleges and some 1,700 schools in states where it can otherwise be enforced.
In many school districts across the country, the rule is to be enforced in some schools but can’t be followed in others.
“There aren’t many other parallels I can give you of two different sets of rules applying in the very same place, one school on one side of the street operating from a different playbook from a school on the other side of the street,” said Brett Sokolow, chair of the Association of Title IX Administrators.
Administrators have been frustrated by lack of guidance from the Biden administration, he said. When the Education Department recently sent schools information about implementing the new policies, it noted that they don’t apply in many places. Sokolow said some districts may need to consider having two separate teams — one trained on the previous rules, the other on the 2024 version — to be prepared for either scenario.
Jay Warona, the deputy executive director and general counsel for the New York State School Boards Association, said his state already offers transgender students some similar protections, but not all of the other components of the new regulation are addressed in state policy.
Warona said he’s fielding messages from school districts wondering what to do, and he’s telling them to check with their district lawyers.
Caius Willingham, senior policy advocate at the National Center for Transgender Equality, said it’s important to note that the injunctions don’t prevent school districts from having similar policies, even as they bar the federal government from enforcing its new regulations in some places.
Meanwhile, students are facing real impacts. Some people barred from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender hold their bladder all day, avoid hydrating or even drop out of school, he said.
“If you can’t meaningfully participate in the educational systems as your true self,” Willingham said, “you’re not going to be able to thrive.”
For Kaemo Mainard O’Connell, a transgender and nonbinary high school senior in Arkansas, the lack of federal protections seems like a signal to encourage behavior such as deadnaming and bullying.
“It means I’m going to have to work much harder to be respected by teachers and by students,” they said. “What not having federal protection does is, it makes it seem like my issues are not real issues.”
Since Arkansas now prohibits transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity, Kaemo has instead been using a single-person restroom at the school, and is required to sign in and often wait before using it.
Similar worries are shared by families of trans kids in Utah, where lawmakers in June passed resolutions instructing state employees to disregard the Title IX directive. Utah is among the states challenging the rules in court, but is struggling to enforce its bathroom restrictions meanwhile: A tip form to report possible violations has been flooded with hoax submissions, and the state official tasked with filtering through them has made his lack of enthusiasm known.
“The bathroom law brought unpleasant conversations and definitely made our kiddo feel othered,” said Utah mom Grace Cooper, whose child is nonbinary. “It also brought a lot of allies out of the woodwork, but without federal protections, my worries as a mother are ever-present.”‎ "
NBC_52,"White House chef, first woman and person of color in role, retires after nearly 30 years",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/white-house-chef-first-woman-person-color-role-retires-nearly-30-years-rcna164544,2024-08-01 05:30:02.817066,,"The White House’s executive chef has retired after nearly three decades of making meals and cooking up state dinners for five different presidents and their families.
Cris Comerford is the first woman to hold the job, and is also the first person of color to be executive chef. Her last day was Friday. First lady Jill Biden thanked her for her service in a statement on Tuesday.
“I always say, food is love. Through her barrier-breaking career, Chef Cris has led her team with warmth and creativity, and nourished our souls along the way,” Jill Biden said in a statement. “With all our hearts, Joe and I are filled with gratitude for her dedication and years of service.”
Comerford, 61, sharpened her culinary skills while working at hotels in Chicago and restaurants in Washington before the White House brought her on in 1995 as an assistant chef.
A naturalized U.S. citizen and a native of the Philippines, she was named executive chef in 2005. Her responsibilities as executive chef included designing and executing menus for state dinners, social events, holiday functions, receptions and official luncheons.
She and pastry chef Susie Morrison — also the first woman in that job — formed a duo that has tantalized the taste buds of guests at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue with their culinary creations for nearly a decade.
A lavish state dinner is a tool of U.S. diplomacy, a high honor reserved for America’s longstanding and closest allies and the food is the signature event. Comerford’s last state dinner was for Kenyan President William Ruto and his wife, Rachel, in May.
The team served a three-course meal of chilled heirloom tomato soup and a “best of both worlds” main course of smoked beef short ribs and butter-poached lobster. Dessert was a homemade white chocolate basket of raspberries, peaches and other fruit.
Chef and humanitarian José Andrés seemed to break the news Monday evening with a post congratulating her. “You are a national treasure, a culinary diplomat who has shown the world how an immigrant can celebrate American food & share it with the world’s leaders,” he posted. “Congrats on retiring, we love you Cris.”"
NBC_53,Harris' foreign policy is a work in progress: From the Politics Desk,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/harris-foreign-policy-doctrine-progress-politics-desk-rcna164594,2024-08-01 05:25:02.817066,,"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.

How Vice President Kamala Harris, now the de facto Democratic nominee, would lead the country as commander in chief remains an open question. 
Interviews with nearly three dozen current and former U.S. officials who have worked with Harris and her team on foreign policy issues, as well as a review of her voting record in the Senate and her public comments, offer limited clues to how she would respond to some high-stakes national security challenges facing the U.S.
President Joe Biden has an extensive foreign policy record from his decades in political office, and former President Donald Trump has his own record from serving four years as commander in chief. 
Harris’ lack of a clear record on foreign policy issues — and no definitive doctrine — is a marked difference and potentially opens a front in the battle over voters’ national security concerns in the 2024 campaign.
Critics say Harris’ reticence is a sign that she lacks both a foreign policy vision and deep expertise. Supporters say that she treaded carefully because she did not want to disagree openly with Biden and his aides, and that she gained a great deal of foreign policy experience as vice president.  
Harris has kept her views closely held during Situation Room meetings and policy debates, according to more than a dozen current and former administration officials. 
Her approach was shaped early in her tenure as vice president by what these officials saw as a lack of confidence in her foreign policy chops, particularly when stacked against Biden’s résumé and hardened positions on key issues. Administration officials — from the Pentagon to the State Department and the White House — have at times tried to decipher Harris’ positions based on questions she asks on specific topics.
Five current and former officials said they believed that distrust of Biden’s inner national security circle left Harris concerned that the president’s aides would leak details of her comments if she expressed any dissent.
Officials close to Harris also acknowledge that she was not confident in her knowledge of foreign policy at the beginning of the Biden administration.

Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly’s stature as a border-state senator who has held hawkish positions before it was popular in the Democratic Party has led some Harris allies to see him as an ideal running mate who could help neutralize what may be her biggest political vulnerability.  
Trump has put immigration at the center of his case against Harris. And unlike other VP contenders, such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kelly is the only one getting a serious look who lives in a state along the southern border and has been out front on the issue.
While he has been a Biden ally on most issues, Kelly has also been a vocal critic on border security. He went after the White House for inadequately funding Arizona’s migrant programs and urged the administration not to reverse a Trump-era policy known as Title 42, which made it easier to turn away migrants at the U.S. border. When the White House revoked the policy anyway in 2022, Kelly called the decision “wrong” and “unacceptable” in a statement.
“We’ve worked together on it in a very positive way. At times, there were disagreements,” Kelly told NBC News while praising “the steps that the administration has recently taken and the results that we have seen from it” in bringing down border crossings, including an executive action restricting who can claim asylum. 
Kelly tried to blunt Trump’s immigration-related attacks during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday, criticizing the former president for his role in sinking a bipartisan border security bill earlier this year.
 “On their side of the field, we realized, we’ve got to get operational control over the border. I realized this, Kamala Harris realizes this, and this legislation was going to do that,” Kelly said. “And our goal here was to get this legislation passed and then start working on comprehensive immigration reform. But this was stopped dead in its tracks by Donald Trump because he wanted to have this as an election issue. Like a lot of other Republicans, they don’t actually want to solve this problem.”

NBC_54,Simone Biles allegedly blocked by former Olympic teammate who criticized Paris team's work ethic,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/simone-biles-allegedly-blocked-social-media-former-olympic-teammate-cr-rcna164533,2024-08-01 05:15:02.817066,,"MyKayla Skinner, who filled in for Simone Biles and won a vault silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, faced an apparent clap back from Biles one month after criticizing the depth, work ethic and talent of the current U.S. team.
Upon winning the gold medal in Tuesday's team final, Biles posted a photo to Instagram with the caption, ""lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,"" which appeared to be a reference to controversial comments made by Skinner during the U.S. Olympic trials.
Now, Skinner has reportedly blocked Biles on social media, according to an Instagram story posted by newly-minted gold medalist Jordan Chiles and a post on X by Biles.
Skinner did not immediately respond to NBC's request for comment.
In a YouTube video that has since been deleted, Skinner shared her live reactions to the 2024 Olympic Gymnastics Trials in June, where the team that won gold on Tuesday was named.
“I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t what it used to be ... obviously, a lot of the girls don’t work as hard,"" she said in the video.
Though she said Biles was an exception to this observation, Skinner faced swift criticism for disparaging the work ethic of the current U.S. national team and issued an apology on social media.
""I want to formally apologize to Team USA and our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes,” Skinner said in a post on X. ""It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work.""
She also claimed in the deleted video that SafeSport, an organization forged to prevent abuse in wake of the Larry Nassar scandal, was partially responsible for what she described as a decline in the coaching quality in the sport, though she also acknowledged positive aspects of its implementation.
Coaches ""have to be really careful about what they say,"" Skinner said. ""Which in some ways is really good, but at the same time, to get where you need to be in gymnastics, you have to be … a little aggressive and a little intense.”
Biles, who has said she is among the survivors of Nassar's abuse, appeared to respond to Skinner's comments in early July, saying ""not everyone needs a mic and a platform"" in a post on Threads. She and other members of the national team unfollowed Skinner on Instagram in the days after her comments.
The disgraced doctor for the U.S. women’s gymnastics team, Nassar was convicted of molesting hundreds of young girls and sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.
Biles testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2021 surrounding the FBI’s mishandling of the case against Nassar.  The Justice Department later agreed to pay over $138 million to victims of Nassar and apologized for the FBI’s failure to follow through on early reports of abuse by the former Team USA doctor.
Her Instagram post on Tuesday immediately attracted support in the comment section from her fellow U.S. Olympic gymnasts, including Suni Lee, McKayla Maroney, Laurie Hernandez and Nastia Liukin.
""It doesn’t get more iconic than this ... Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name,"" said Maroney, who is a two-time Olympic medalist and was among the first Olympic gymnasts to publicly accuse Nassar of abuse. 
She and Skinner have the same first name, though they spell it differently.
While this apparent feud with Biles has been particularly high-profile, Skinner also faced criticism in 2016 for sharing a photoshopped picture on social media, replacing the face of 2012 Olympic all-around champion Gabby Douglas with her own. She was an alternate for the 2016 Olympic team and was slammed for sharing the post, which some fans described as being racist.
Skinner traveled to Tokyo as an individual competitor for the U.S., meaning she was not a part of the Olympic team that won silver in 2021. She initially did not qualify for any Tokyo finals, but after Biles withdrew from the vault final due to the twisties, Skinner took her place and earned a silver medal.
She retired from gymnastics after the Tokyo Olympics and gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte, in September.I’m the newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital and cover all things gymnastics, culture and breaking news.

NBC_55,Watchdog slams William Barr over 'chaotic' response to 2020 Black Lives Matter protests,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/watchdog-slams-ex-ag-william-barr-chaotic-response-2020-black-lives-ma-rcna164494,2024-08-01 05:12:02.817066,,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department's internal watchdog on Wednesday issued a damning report criticizing former Attorney General William Barr for overseeing a ""chaotic and disorganized"" response to protests, unrest and rioting in the nation's capital following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.
The report found that Barr, who served as attorney general under then-President Donald Trump in 2019 and 2020, ""pressed DOJ law enforcement components to deploy personnel without sufficient attention to whether those personnel were properly trained or equipped for their mission.""
The Justice Department's inspector general criticized the deployment of government agents who weren't wearing uniforms that noted the agency they belonged to, let alone wearing name tags or numbers that would allow them to be individually identified if they used excessive force, in responding to protests in 2020.
""We were troubled by the Department leadership’s decision-making that required DOJ law enforcement agents and elite tactical units to perform missions for which they lacked the proper equipment and training,"" the report from DOJ's Office of Inspector General stated. ""Multiple witnesses also told us that leadership did not timely and effectively communicate these deployment decisions to subordinates and non-DOJ agencies involved in the response.""
It was Barr’s idea to bring in federal prison employees to handle civilian protests, even though those employees had no experience with such situations and were only used to handling unrest in carceral institutions where individuals were convicted criminals with restricted constitutional rights, as opposed to free American citizens with full rights under the constitution.
At the time, a senior Justice Department praised Barr’s move, saying it reflected “outside the box“ thinking, and saying they’d done “amazing” with the logistical elements.
But multiple experts, including a former Justice Department inspector general, contemporaneously criticized the approach, particularly the deployment of anonymous federal agents from an unknown agency patrolling the streets of Washington during a volatile situation.
“Overall, we shared the serious concerns expressed to us by law enforcement personnel and were most troubled by the Department leadership’s decision-making in putting DOJ law enforcement agents and elite tactical units in close proximity to the public and requiring them to perform missions for which they lacked the proper equipment and training,” the report stated. “Multiple law enforcement witnesses told us that these deployment decisions appeared to have been made hastily and without sufficient understanding of, and priority given to, the capabilities of those deployed, and that leadership did not timely and effectively communicate their decisions to subordinates and other non-DOJ agencies involved in the response.”
Directions from Justice Department leaders led to “standard practices being set aside, resulting in law enforcement components having to compromise between following the Department’s directives and ensuring that any deployments were safe and effective.”
Neither Barr nor a number of other former DOJ officials cooperated with the inspector general's investigation. Barr did not to a request for comment from NBC News.
Barr, the report said, ""was directly involved in making tactical decisions that typically are handled by the Department’s law enforcement components, such as decisions about the deployment of agents to particular locations.""
The report specifically referenced Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officers being deployed to an area outside the White House on June 1, 2020, when law enforcement cleared protesters before Trump walked across the street to a nearby church and held a Bible for cameras.
Barr’s chief of staff sent an email at the time telling the BOP ""to deploy personnel to the White House immediately"" even though BOP staff had ""received no guidance"" about their mission or rules of engagement, the report said.
""One BOP supervisor stated that he did not have his personnel bring shields with them because they were unaware that they were going to be assisting with crowd control,"" the inspector general report said. ""It was not until after they arrived at Lafayette Park that they learned of their role, less than an hour before the clearing operation began.""
The report concluded that Barr ""did not impact the timing of the clearing operation,"" but that a statement to the press from Kerri Kupec, who was then Barr's chief spokeswoman and now works for Fox News, ""gave the inaccurate impression Barr had personally ordered the operation and led to significant public confusion regarding DOJ’s role in it.""
The inspector general report confirmed that Kupec was the ""senior DOJ official"" who told reporters that Barr told law enforcement to ""get it done"" just before they cleared the area outside the White House using force and less-lethal munitions but witnesses indicated Barr never made those remarks.
Kupec did not cooperate with the inspector general’s investigation either and did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
Barr did direct DOJ’s law enforcement components “to supply specific numbers of personnel for deployments before establishing and communicating a mission"" for those personnel, the report says.
Ultimately, 13 BOP personnel reported firing 72 pepper balls at members of the crowd during the June 1 clearing operation, according to the report. The lack of markings on their uniforms ""was due to the fact that the BOP does not traditionally deploy personnel in a public-facing role outside the prison setting,"" the report said.
The former head of the BOP told investigators that BOP staff had never dealt with a civilian protest like the one they encountered, but said they were used to doing crowd control ""in a different environment"" and that the tactics and formations were no different in a civilian environment versus inside a prison.
In prison, BOP staffers ""know our use of force, we know exactly what we can and can’t do when an inmate does something in a facility,"" said Michael Carvajal, the BOP director, told investigators in a comment included in the report. “A little bit different out here, with a teenager and a cellphone.” 
Notes from the director of the U.S. Marshals Service said that Barr told officials in a conference call on June 1 that they needed to deploy ""max strength"" in Washington and ""dominate the streets."" Those comments came after Barr had communications with the White House about a fire that had broken out at the St. John’s Church parish annex near the White House, where Trump would hold a Bible during a photo-op that afternoon.
The report also notes the media coverage of law enforcement personnel not wearing nameplates or even gear that identified their agency. The report noted that photographs they reviewed showed BOP officers ""dressed in green or black shirts equipped with tactical gear including helmets, vests, shields, and various munitions,"" and noted that one administrator told investigators the ""hodge-podge"" uniforms were a result of pulling personnel from different prisons. One official said they only became aware of the issue through media coverage.
Carvajal told reporters on June 4, 2020, that he could have done a better job marking BOP officials and told the IG it was an ""oversight,"" and the IG report notes that the BOP soon worked with private vendors to get patches made to identify officers.
""He also said that subsequent to this deployment, the BOP developed standardized markers for its crisis management teams that both identifies the wearer as a member of the BOP and also has a personal identifying number for each BOP officer,"" the report stated. ""Following the failure of the BOP and other federal law enforcement officers who responded to civil disturbances during the summer of 2020 to identify themselves or wear identifying insignia, Congress amended Title 10 to require federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members to visibly display each individual’s name or other unique identifier, as well as the name of the federal agency that employs that individual.""Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News."
NBC_56,‘Top Chef’ star Shirley Chung decides to keep her tongue after tongue cancer diagnosis,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/top-chef-star-shirley-chung-diagnosed-stage-4-tongue-cancer-s-chosen-k-rcna164591,2024-08-01 05:00:02.817066,,"Shirley Chung, “Top Chef” alum and restaurateur, announced she’s been diagnosed with Stage 4 tongue cancer.
“Hiiiii loves, I have some personal news to share with you,” Chung wrote in the caption of her Instagram post on July 26. The post includes a slideshow of photos and video of Chung shaving her head while receiving cancer treatment.
The Beijing-born chef detailed a series of dental issues she’d been experiencing since December, including “severely” biting her tongue, fracturing a tooth and the development of ulcers in her mouth. While she initially thought it was all because of her heavy teeth grinding, an oral surgeon discovered a tumor under her tongue while treating the ulcers.
“A few days later,” she wrote, “I was diagnosed.”
Chung goes on to say she was “very calm” when she first heard the news, adding that she’s always been someone who thrives under pressure: “I was extremely focused on getting all the tests and scans as fast as possible, so I can start on the treatment plans.”
Then, reality set in on June 2, when her oncologist called to discuss treatment plans.
“I broke down, crying, trying to put thoughts together and ask questions but physically couldn’t, all I heard was ‘option 1, surgery, 100% removal of your tongue,’” Chung wrote.
She then heard about a “unicorn case” out of the University of Chicago, where another chef, Grant Achatz, was cured using radiation and chemotherapy.
“I still don’t understand how surgeons say, the only anything we can do is cut your tongue out; we have to cut your tongue out, first step, cut your tongue out,” Daniel J. Haraf, medical director of radiation and oncology at UChicago Medicine said in an interview. “And I go, why should that be the first step?”
While Chung was aware that tongue removal had a higher success rate, that didn’t matter as much to the TV personality.
“Higher survival rate, or keep my tongue? I chose to keep my tongue,” Chung said. “I am a fighter, I am a chef, I can be that unicorn too.”
So, she headed to Chicago and, as of Friday, finished her first six weeks of chemo, with “many more to go.” She called her four-times-weekly trips to the hospital “a full time job,” and said it’s been working so far. “My tumor is shrinking, my speech is much better and I can eat most normal food now,” she added.
Chung, who immigrated to the U.S. at 17 years old, had a Silicon Valley career prior to becoming a chef. She then worked her way through different restaurant groups until she opened her own modern Chinese restaurant in Orange County, California, called Twenty Eight. She was a contestant on seasons 11 (where she made it into the top three) and 14 (runner up) of Bravo’s “Top Chef.”
She said through the trials that come with fighting cancer, she’s learned to lean on others and accept support, “to let go, to be more vulnerable.” It took her two weeks to decide whether she should tell her parents about the diagnosis, and until Friday, the only other people who knew were her “close circle of friends” and her sister.
“I am learning, I can be strong 98% of the time, it’s ok to be not ok,” she wrote. “I have a long road to recovery in front of me. Your love and support will carry me through. Cheer me on, Shirley Chung 2.0 will be reborn in 2025!”
Her cheering section got loud, with friends and chefs like Alex Guarnaschelli, Kardea Brown, Aarti Sequeira and Jet Tila leaving supportive comments on the post.
Guarnaschelli told Chung to not “be a chef at this time,” but instead “be a person who’s cool with getting support and love.”
“Can I just speak to the person you are,” Brown wrote in the comments. The chef said she met Chung the day before she received her treatment plan, “but we had no clue about the battle you were fighting.” She continued on, writing about how Chung cooked that night and “had the biggest smile on your face the entire time,” which she wrote “speaks volumes about your character.”
“This cancer clearly hasn’t met Shirley Chung,” Sequeira wrote. “Like, why would you even try?”
A seemingly endless stream of other chefs — Andrew Zimmern, Gregory Gourdet, Nina Compton, Leah Cohen, Michael Voltaggio and more — chimed in as well with words of encouragement and support.Rachel Askinasi is a reporter covering the food industry including restaurants, trends, agriculture, industry news and more for TODAY.com."
NBC_57,Donald Trump says again he would 'absolutely' pardon Jan. 6 rioters,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/donald-trump-says-absolutely-pardon-jan-6-rioters-rcna164565,2024-08-01 06:55:02.749288,,"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump said once again Wednesday that he would pardon Jan. 6 rioters if he wins the 2024 election, repeatedly lying about what happened during the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol that injured more than 140 police officers.
""Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,"" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists on Wednesday. ""They were convicted by a very tough system.""
More than 1,400 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and prosecutors have secured more than 1,000 convictions on charges ranging from unlawful parading to seditious conspiracy. Hundreds of cases remain pending, and more arrests are expected before five-year statute of limitations runs out in early 2026, but all the Jan. 6 cases could theoretically be brought to an end if Trump wins and his appointees take over the Justice Department.
Trump has referred to Jan. 6 rioters as warriors, ""unbelievable patriots,"" political prisoners and ""hostages."" Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan and has overseen numerous Capitol attack trials, has expressed shock at the ""preposterous"" rhetoric about convicted criminals that Republicans regularly use about Jan. 6 rioters. “In my thirty-seven years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream,"" Lamberth said this year.
On Wednesday, when asked about his plans for Jan. 6 rioters by Rachel Scott of ABC News, Trump engaged in whataboutism, falsely claiming that there had been a ""horrible attack on the Capitol"" last week when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Congress. That's not true: Police successfully kept pro-Palestinian demonstrators away from the Capitol. 
Trump appeared to be referencing protests at Columbus Circle by Union Station, where protesters burned flags, spray painted a 1912 monument to Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and a 49-year-old replica of the Liberty Bell, and assaulted officers. One officer appeared to have been dragged by the collar from behind when he attempted to effectuate an arrest. Ten individuals were arrested, and the U.S. Park Police are seeking the identities of six other individuals, including for assaults on officers and vandalizing federal property.
“They viciously attacked our government, they fought with police, they fought with them much more openly than I saw on Jan. 6,” Trump claimed of the pro-Palestinian protesters.
While there were assaults on officers on July 24, those assaults are not comparable to the multitude of assaults on law enforcement that took place during the hours-long Jan. 6 attack, which left multiple officers with life-altering and career-ending injuries and resulted in the line-of-duty death of Officer Jeffrey Smith. Another officer, Brian Sicknick, died the day after the attack of natural causes, but a medical examiner said that what transpired during the attack ""played a role"" in his death.
Jan. 6 defendants were caught on tape brandishing or using firearms, stun guns, flagpoles, fire extinguishers, bike racks, batons, a metal whip, office furniture, pepper spray, bear spray, a tomahawk ax, a hatchet, a hockey stick, knuckle gloves, a baseball bat, a massive “Trump” billboard, “Trump” flags, a pitchfork, pieces of lumber, crutches and even an explosive device during the brutal attack. 
Trump claimed that the spray paint on the monuments that he falsely stated were at the Capitol ""will never actually come off, especially in the limestone"" and that the paint will be seen on the stone ""100 years for now.""
When an NBC News reporter visited Columbus Circle on Wednesday evening, the cleanup effort appeared to have been effective, though there were some remnants of the vandalism remaining around the site. Trump's claims about permanent damage to the monument are suspect: The monument — which few visitors even realize is dedicated to Columbus — has regularly fallen into disrepair and neglect, and the National Park Service noted in 2016 that the statuary had already “been painted over to hide expanding discoloration.” This isn't the first time the monument has been spray painted — back in 1991, the Columbus Fountain was hit with red paint and ""500 years of genocide"" graffiti.
When Scott asked Trump directly whether he would pardon Jan. 6 rioters who were seen on video assaulting officers with flagpoles and dragging officers down the stairs of the Capitol, Trump didn't answer and instead pivoted to talking about the officer who shot and killed a Jan. 6 rioter.
""They shot a young lady in the face who was protesting,"" Trump said, referring to Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed as she jumped through a broken window leading into the House Speaker's Lobby as members of Congress were fleeing the mob that was attempting to break into the House chamber. The Black officer who shot and killed Babbitt has come under racist attacks and threats in the aftermath of the shooting and said he only shot her ""as a last resort"" after law enforcement barricaded the doors with every piece of furniture they could find.
""You went after the J6 people with a vengeance,"" Trump said Wednesday, before repeating a conspiracy theory that officers were ""ushering everybody into the Capitol."" In reality, officers at the Capitol were overwhelmed by a hostile mob, with one lifelong Republican officer testifying at a recent trial that the scene he saw at the Capitol was unlike anything he'd encountered in his decades in law enforcement.
Trump claimed that there were ""two systems of justice"" and that he is facing criminal charges related to Jan. 6 and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election not as a result of his own actions but because he was being targeted due to politics.
""We're going to win our cases and we're going to be vindicated, but I have to spend a lot of time on that, and money, that's what they want,"" Trump said. ""After the election, they won't care ... although, in my case, I think they probably will, because the hatred is deep.""
Trump's trial over his efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power by lying about the election results will not happen until after the November election due to the Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity. That court ruling is also likely to weaken special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 case against Trump.
The former president's comments came the same day the Justice Department announced three new cases against Jan. 6 defendants.
Michael Kieth Williams was arrested in Texas, with authorities saying he stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 while ""carrying a flag depicting then-President Donald Trump as the character 'Rambo.'"" Williams, authorities said, made it onto the floor of the Senate and then faced off with officers outside of the Capitol and ""aggressively waived the large Trump flag towards officers for several minutes,"" which they said helped prevented officers from moving forward and interfered with the effectiveness of the chemical irritants officers used to try to keep the pro-Trump mob at bay.
Paul Marvin Nowell was arrested in North Carolina, with authorities saying he approached a police line on the west front of the U.S. Capitol while wearing a black paintball mask and then yelled, ""You are not Americans"" at officers and refused police orders to move back before he pushed against officers' shields.
Jason Robert Tasker was arrested in Arizona, with authorities saying he harassed officers outside the Capitol, yelling, ""All of you are dismissed, go home!” before lunging at officers during two confrontations and attempting to grab two officers during a struggle with police. He found another way into the building, then confronted officers inside the Capitol, prosecutors say. Tasker then bragged about his actions in a phone call while on the steps of the Capitol.
""I was like the first person in Momma,"" Tasker was recorded saying.Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News."
NBC_58,"Gen x, millennials face higher risk of 17 cancers than older generations",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-gen-x-millennials-17-types-reverse-trend-rcna164376,2024-08-01 06:31:02.749288,,"Younger generations have a heightened risk of some cancers, new research found. 
A study published Wednesday in Lancet Public Health found that Gen X and millennials are more likely to be diagnosed with 17 types of cancer, including nine that had been declining in older adults. Researchers aren’t sure why, but say obesity is likely a leading cause.
“What is happening in these generations can be considered a bellwether for future cancer trends,” said Hyuna Sung, a cancer epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, who led the research. 
Rates of colorectal cancer — one of the 17 types — have been rising among younger people for decades, a troubling trend that sparked investigation into other types of cancer. Sung and her colleagues used cancer diagnosis and mortality data from two databases –– the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics –– to analyze cancer trends in people born between 1920 and 1990, who were diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2019. 
The data included 34 types of cancer, nearly 24,000,000 diagnoses and more than 7 million deaths. To get a better view of how cancer diagnoses and mortality rates changed in groups of people born around the same year –– called a birth cohort –– the researchers grouped people by birth year in five-year intervals. For example, people born in 1920 through 1924 were all one birth cohort. 
Seventeen of the 34 cancers had increasing incidence in younger people. The risk was two-to-three times higher in people born in 1990, for pancreatic, kidney and small intestine cancers, compared to people born in 1955. Liver cancer diagnoses in women followed the same pattern. 
“The most important thing it tells us is there is something that changed for the group of individuals born after this period of time. They have been exposed to some environmental or lifestyle factor that is leading to this shift,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved with the research. 
After declining for decades, these types of cancers ​​have begun to climb again: 
While the study found that mortality declined or was stable in younger generations for most cancers, mortality rate increased among younger age groups for endometrial, intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder, colorectal and testicular cancers, as well as liver cancer among women. 
Endometrial cancer was the fastest growing for both diagnoses and mortality.
“That was a sobering finding,” said Sung. “Although many cancer rates are rising, we don’t necessarily see this increase in mortality because we are treating them a lot better than before.”
Many of the cancers found to be on the rise are still rare in young people and, while rates have increased, the overall number of cases is comparatively low. 
“It is clearly happening. Almost all the oncologists I know of can say they see it,” Brawley said, adding that despite the alarming increases, it’s important to keep in mind that most cancer diagnoses still happen in people older than 50 years. 
“In the 1990s, 10% of people diagnosed with colon cancer were under age 50. Now it’s 20%, but we should not forget the 80% that are still over the age of 50,” he said. 
Looking at people born within a specific time period can give important clues into why certain types of cancer are rising among younger generations. 
“All of these cancers are linked to the obesity epidemic. We know that’s the second-leading cause of cancer right now, behind tobacco use,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Oncology and Epidemiology Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved with the new study. 
About 20% of cancer diagnoses in the U.S. are linked to excess body weight, according to the American Cancer Society. Obesity rates in the nation changed little in the 1960s and 1970s, but increased sharply after that. About 13% of adults had obesity in 1980, compared to 34% in 2008, according to data from the Surgeon General. 
Among children, obesity rates grew from 5% to 17% in the same period. Today, more than 40% of American adults and about 20% of children and adolescents are obese, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. 
If obesity is a culprit, it’s likely one of several lifestyle and environmental factors that is leading to the rise. Other factors could be more sedentary behavior or something in the food or the water, common medications or chemical exposures or chemical agents, the experts said.
The overuse of antibiotics is another possible link under scrutiny. Antibiotics are known to change the gut microbiome, which has been linked to colorectal cancer. While antibiotics are needed to treat many bacterial infections, they’re often misused and taken for issues that are not bacterial, or that do not require antibiotics.  
“The list of things we are potentially investigating is very long,” Cercek said. “Antibiotics are one of the top culprits on the list.”
Researchers still don’t understand what’s behind the rise in certain types of cancers among younger generations. Although obesity and antibiotics are primary suspects, “we can’t rule out other chemical exposures or chemical agents,” Brawley said.

Mohammed, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin ‘Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi will plead guilty to some charges as early as next week at Guantanamo Bay, the Office of Military Commissions said.
The terms of the agreement are not available, the Pentagon said in a statement.
They are expected to plead guilty to lesser charges that could spare them the death penalty.
Mohammed and several other defendants, including the two others included the plea agreement, were initially charged and arraigned in 2008 in connection with their alleged role in the attack, according to the statement.
Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and held with other al Qaeda detainees at Guantanamo Bay.Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

NBC_60,NBC Select editors’ favorite products from July 2024,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/editors-favorites-july-rcna97559,2024-08-01 06:00:02.749288,,"If you’re like me or the rest of the NBC Select staff, July was a big spending month. After Amazon Prime Day, Target Circle Week and ongoing weekly sales, I, alongside my colleagues, went a little spending heavy. To put things into perspective, during Amazon’s 48-hour member-exclusive sale, our team spent over $2,300. That’s only two days out of the 31 we had this month.
Below, we’re sharing some of our favorite standout purchases from July. Some are items we bought ourselves, others are courtesy samples from brands. We have favorites across every major category, including helpful pet finds, skin care products, summer essentials and more.

While New York City always gets hot and humid in the summer, this year has been especially rough, given our several heat waves. I finally caved and bought this popular handheld fan from Amazon, and honestly, I wish I had gotten it sooner. Only slightly larger than a bar of soap, it has three-speed settings — all of which are cooling —  a built-in flashlight and it even works as a power bank for charging your phone. I like that the blades aren’t sharp at all, it’s relatively quiet and the battery lasts me hours. I especially prioritize using it during my commute to and from work and during walks outside. — Cory Fernandez, commerce editor
Earlier this month, I moved apartments within my neighborhood, which meant walking many of my items to my new place. This wagon was a game changer during the moving process, making carrying multiple heavy boxes stress-free. It’s surprisingly spacious, so I could fit around three to four large boxes or five to six medium boxes plus other small items simultaneously. It can hold up to 265 pounds, so items like my cast-iron pans, a loaded toolbox and a desktop computer were easy to maneuver. I had no issues steering the cart around the crowded streets of New York City, and it collapses into a flat, portable shape when I’m done. — Mili Godio, updates editor
I grew up in a Rao’s marinara sauce household, and even as an adult, I rarely stray from my preferred brand when making homemade pizza and pasta. But after learning about Sauz’s origin story — founded by two friends around my age — I was intrigued. The brand sent me its line of sauces to try: Hot Honey Marinara, Creamy Calabrian Vodka, Summer Lemon Marinara and Wild Rosemary Marinara.
I’ve been going through each one over the past few weeks and cooked with them for my family and friends so everyone could try it. We’re all officially obsessed. Each sauce is incredibly flavorful, and I love the addition of ingredients like hot honey and Calabrian chili peppers that take a standard sauce and amp it up. The Hot Honey Marinara, for example, added spicy sweetness to my flatbread, and the Wild Rosemary Marinara took my vegan meatballs from good to fantastic. — Zoe Malin, associate updates editor
I’m a pour-over coffee fan, so I look forward to my coffee-making ritual each morning. I previously made my pour-overs using a coffee filter in a generic glass carafe, but in a moment of clumsiness, I dropped it and shattered it a few weeks back. I replaced it with the Chemex, which I had been eyeing for a while after multiple experts recommended it to me in our pour-over coffee guide, and it has become one of my favorite purchases this year.
I use the brand’s coffee filters, which fit comfortably inside the spout and don’t rip like many other paper filters I’ve tried. The coffee tastes rich and not diluted, and pouring it out of the carafe is seamless. Plus, it comes with a wooden collar, so it’s super easy to handle, even with hot coffee inside. – Mili Godio, updates editor
I’m very, very picky when it comes to protein powder. I’ve tried dozens of them over the years, and I often have to abandon formulas because they taste artificial or give my smoothies a powdery, gritty texture. I picked up Shaklee’s gluten-free, vegan Life Shake at an event the brand recently hosted and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. The vanilla flavor isn’t too sweet for my preferences and blends seamlessly into my smoothies, giving them an extra creamy texture. The resealable bag keeps the protein powder fresh and comes with a little scoop to measure portions. I feel nourished after drinking my smoothie with Life Shake in it, and it refuels me after a long run or strength training session. — Zoe Malin, associate updates editor
Brooklinen makes some of my favorite bed and bath items, so I decided to switch things up and try a new set from the brand. The Luxe Sateen bed sheets have a silky-soft feel with a subtle sheen. The best part is that I don’t overheat in these while I sleep, which I often do and is usually a dealbreaker for me.
For example, I recently accidentally fell asleep before turning on my air conditioner, and when I woke up, I wasn’t hot or sweaty and felt like I was at the right temperature thanks to these sheets. On top of being soft and breathable, they’re also easy to clean (they hold up well after multiple washes), and the fitted sheet doesn’t come undone easily. — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
My friends are my biggest influencers, so after trying out Malin’s bath mat from Dorai, I knew it was an absolute must-have for my new apartment. Although it looks and feels like natural stone, it’s made from a smooth, fast-drying ceramic-like material. This allows the bath mat to repel water quickly rather than absorb it like a traditional one would, preventing the growth of mold and bacteria, according to the brand. In addition to drying in literal seconds, it’s also one of the most aesthetically pleasing pieces in my bathroom.  — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
This Tineco vacuum makes cleaning my hardwood floors less of a chore. It functions as a cordless vacuum and a mop simultaneously, eliminating my need to buy two appliances and cutting down on my time spent cleaning — a win-win. I fill up the water tank, add the included cleaning solution, press start and choose one of the four modes available: auto, custom, suction and max. I typically use auto mode, which detects messes and decides how much suction and water it needs to release. After using it a few times already, I’m impressed by how much dirt and grime it picks up. I can see how filthy my floors were when I empty the dirty water tank. Since getting it, I even convinced my mom to purchase her own, and we both agree that it’s one of the most convenient home items to have. — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
Wearing a pair of eye masks while watching TV on the couch is my favorite way to wind down after a long day, so I jumped at the opportunity to try these. The eye masks are made from hydrogel, a somewhat sticky material that grips my skin well and gives off a cooling sensation. They’re infused with vitamin C, peptides, hyaluronic acid and allantoin, ingredients that help brighten dark circles, stimulate collagen production and hydrate skin, according to the brand. After wearing these eye patches, my skin feels tighter and refreshed. My favorite thing is that they’re not goopy or dripping with excess fluid. The side that doesn’t touch my skin is covered in a fabric-like material, so I can wear my glasses on top of them. — Zoe Malin, associate updates editor
Summer in New York City clogs my pores, so I focus on double cleansing and finding the right products for my naturally dry, eczema-prone skin. After getting a facial at Naturopathica’s spa, I haven’t stopped thinking about and using their cleansing balm. I’ve tried other options before, and I thought I loved them, but this one is gentle on my skin, smells like a jar of honey, and is super effective at removing layers of skin care, makeup and grime that accumulates throughout the day. Surprisingly, my skin feels soft and moisturized after using it. Usually, other balms leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but that’s not the case with this one. To say I’m in love is an understatement, but who wouldn’t when it feels like they have a spa in their bathroom?  — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
I’m an avid flosser and can say with confidence that this is the best floss I’ve ever used. I discovered Cocofloss after it won an NBC Select Wellness Award for best floss earlier this year; reading the positive feedback from my co-workers who tested it influenced me to try it out, and I haven’t looked back. I notice a major difference in how my teeth feel when I go a few days without using this floss.
At first, it felt a little uncomfortable since I used string floss instead of woven, but I got used to it quickly. It reaches places other floss doesn’t and my mouth genuinely feels cleaner.  – Kelsey Fredricks, production coordinator
I’m always looking for hair care products that better define my curls and eliminate frizz, which this mask does. Aveda sent me it to try, along with a selection of its other curly hair products, and I’ve been using it once a week for the past month after I use clarifying shampoo. As I use my fingers to comb the masque through my curls, I feel how much softer they get — it’s like my hair is drinking up all the moisture and holding on to it. It makes my curls look bouncier, shinier and less frizzy. Plus, my bathroom always smells amazing after each use. Multiple people compliment my hair lately, which is always the best feeling. — Zoe Malin, associate updates editor
I run dry, so I need skin care products that are hydrating and designed for my type, specifically serums.  This serum from Prequel feels like hydration in a bottle — I’m not exaggerating. I apply a few pumps of it during my nighttime routine right after toning, and it immediately cools and hydrates my skin. After massaging it in, my skin appears less dull and has a more radiant glow. Plus, the serum not only makes my skin look more plump and bouncy, it also doesn’t irritate my dry eczema-prone skin.  When I wake up to complete my morning skin care routine,  my skin is in noticeably better shape than the day prior. – Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
On my recent trip to France, I stopped by the pharmacy but didn’t have time to grab everything I wanted to try out. This edit from Dermstore saves the day by having full-size and sample-size products, including skin care and hair care items from French brands, like Caudalíe and Avène. Some of these products are ones I’ve tried before, others I’ve been eyeing for the longest time, and others I haven’t heard of, so it’s a perfect way to try out new-to-me brands. — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
I’m terrible at remembering to clean my makeup brushes. This soap from Jenny Patinkin makes it so easy to do, so now I’m more inclined to clean my brushes regularly. (The brand sent me a courtesy sample to test.) All I have to do is wet my makeup brushes, swirl them around the soap in the container, rinse them under water and repeat until both the soap and brushes run clear. Afterward, I’ll lay my brushes out to dry and leave the tin container open to fully dry the soap. The results on both my new and old brushes were astonishing. What was once an old brush coated in makeup now looked brand new. Plus, the bristles felt softer and had no soapy residue on them. — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
Over the years I have acquired many items from Baggu including its medium crescent bag, laptop case, fanny pack, a now-discounted water bottle sling and a bunch of its lightweight reusable bags, so you could say I’m a fan. I recently decided I hate carrying around a hard glasses case since it takes up so much space in my bag and is heavier than I want. I knew Baggu would have the perfect solution. This soft-sided padded case is lightweight and easy to spot in my bag. It has a magnetic closure, which I appreciate since the Velcro on the similarly padded earpods case I have from Baggu has frayed over time. — Lindsay Schneider, commerce editor
There’s no better compliment than getting asked where you bought something because a friend or co-worker also wants to buy it. That’s exactly what happened to me with this phone chain and case. It’s a two-piece endeavor you buy individually: a clear phone case with little ball connectors on the bottom and your chain of choice. (You can attach or detach your chain by connecting them to little silver balls at the bottom of the compatible case. That way, once you buy the case, you can keep accessorizing it with as many chains as you’d like.)
The chain hangs from the bottom of my phone so it never gets in the way of my camera when I need to take photos. I’m currently using a tulip-inspired option and I love that the chain is both functional (you can wear it around your wrist to hold onto your phone) and that it feels like a piece of jewelry — they’re a great way to express my mood or pair with my outfit of the day. There are many chain designs to choose from and now I want a million more. — Lindsay Schneider, commerce editor
If I could wear sweatpants every day for any occasion, I would. And for most at-home leisure or work-from-home tasks, I do. But finding ones that I feel comfortable wearing when walking my dog outside is hard — most are too baggy, long or generally oversized for my taste. These Amazon sweatpants, on the other hand,  look and feel great. They’re soft inside and have a high-waisted fit with a comfortable, stretchy waistband and drawstring. The wide-leg design is flattering and modern, plus the length is perfect for me (I’m 5 feet and 3 inches tall, for reference). I also love that it has deep pockets, so I can easily take essentials like my wallet, keys and phone without needing to grab a purse on my way out. – Mili Godio, updates editor
I wear a claw clip every day and had yet to find one that felt elegant or chic until I bought this handmade-in-Italy clip from Undo Hairware. Its glossy, silky texture feels smooth in my hand and looks sophisticated and polished IRL. It’s not the strongest claw clip I’ve ever used but it still gets the job done. I haven’t seen any comparable option that looks or feels like this so it’s a win. — Lindsay Schneider, commerce editor
I recently took this Baggu bag to the beach and could comfortably fit my favorite 22-ounce water bottle, the essentials (keys, phone and wallet), SPF lip balm, a bottle of face and body sunscreen, my e-reader and more. (I couldn’t fit my Kindle Scribe on top of those other items, but I could squeeze in my Paperwhite.) I  like how adjustable the new 47-inch extended strap is and how the bag comes with two internal zip pockets. It’s comfortable and lightweight and I see why it’s one of Baggu’s bestsellers. – Kelsey Fredricks, production coordinator
Trying to get my cat to take a pill is the most humbling thing I’ve ever experienced. I’ve tried everything — mixing it into her food, using pill pocket treats, crushing it up into baby food and canned tuna… the list goes on. She somehow outsmarts me every time, which practically leaves me in tears and her without medication. I found this pill wrap on Amazon and the reviews convinced me to buy it. Shoppers say their difficult cats love it, so I tried it. It’s genuinely a miracle product.
I take a little bit of the bacon-flavored paste and use it to cover my cat’s pill, which totally disguises it, as well as masks its smell and taste. My cat gobbles up her pill the second I put it in front of her, making my life significantly more peaceful. Every pet parent needs to keep this at home in case they find themselves in a situation like me. — Zoe Malin, associate updates editor
I love being influenced by NBC Select content. The social team recently posted a video about this rubber fur broom, and I instantly added it to my cart. Once in a while, you’ll find a product that feels like a game changer, and this is one of those situations. I constantly clean my apartment floors since my dog’s hair always piles up, especially during the hotter months of the year. This broom makes life a bit easier when it comes to cleaning the carpet, especially because sometimes a vacuum doesn’t always get the job done. – Jordan Bowman, commerce editor
My 8-year-old pitbull has a big neck, so many collars that I’ve tried in the past on her, don’t actually fit around her. This one from Approved by Fritz does. It’s a true size large and adjustable, so I can put it around her neck comfortably without worrying if it’s too loose or tight. The collar and leash are also easy to clean. My dog’s previous collars were more of a fabric-like material that attracted and retained a lot of odors and stains, even after I repeatedly scrubbed them. This one’s made from water-resistant plastic-coated nylon, which, in my experience, has been durable and easy to clean. (I do so by quickly swiping a wet wipe.) Overall, it’s approved by Fritz, Baylor, and me.  — Bianca Alvarez, associate reporter
After wearing my AirPods for eight hours or more a day, they started to feel a little uncomfortable in my ears with my constant sweating. This convinced me to switch to the AirPods Max over-ear headphones and I feel solid about my decision to convert. I love how sleek these look and how seamlessly they connect to my other Apple products, like my MacBook and iPhone. They charge quickly and have a long battery life, up to 20 hours of listening on a single charge, according to the brand. Also, the noise-canceling feature is effective, but I prefer the transparency mode, which lets me hear the ambient sound around me, so I can be aware of my surroundings. . – Jeffrey Kelly, intern
I started feeling uncomfortable tucking my AirPods Pro earbuds into my ears daily and needed to clean them more often, so I splurged and bought these over-ear headphones on sale during Prime Day. I like how easy the Bose app is to navigate and how I can enable soothing background noises (like white noise and rain sounds) to help block out even more sound.

NBC_61,Team USA men's basketball cruises to win in rematch vs. South Sudan,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/team-usa-mens-basketball-cruises-win-rematch-vs-south-sudan-rcna164596,2024-08-01 06:00:02.749288,,"After barely escaping with a one-point win vs. South Sudan in an exhibition earlier this month, USA had a much easier time on Wednesday.
The States cruised to a 103-86 win, moving to 2-0 in group play. South Sudan fell to 1-1 with the loss.
The U.S. led for the vast majority of the contest. After a little bit of back-and-forth action early, USA took a lead with just under four minutes to go in the first quarter and would hold on to it for the rest of the night. 
Bam Adebayo was the star performer in the game. Coming off the bench, he scored 18 points on 8-for-10 shooting, draining two 3s and adding seven rebounds and two blocks for good measure. It was a balanced effort elsewhere, with five other players scoring in double digits. 
It was a little bit of a different look for the U.S. compared to its opener against Serbia. In that game, Joel Embiid started at center while Jayson Tatum infamously never made it on the court. Against South Sudan, coach Steve Kerr started Anthony Davis in place of Embiid, and Tatum in place of Jrue Holiday.
Embiid didn’t play at all, while Holiday was part of the bench group that included Adebayo, Kevin Durant, Derrick White and Anthony Edwards. Tyrese Haliburton also saw his first action of the Olympics, meaning 11 players earned minutes Wednesday.
Outside of a very brief injury scare to Davis in the second, and a South Sudan run that cut the lead from 21 points to 10 in the third, the U.S. didn’t run into any trouble. It was quite a reversal from the exhibition the two countries played on July 20. In that game, the States squeaked out a 101-100 win thanks to a LeBron James layup in the waning seconds.
South Sudan had the U.S.’s full focus on Wednesday, and it was overwhelming. The ball movement was popping offensively, while the defense was stifling, particularly the second unit led by Adebayo, Holiday and White. South Sudan turned the ball over 19 times, a big no-no as the U.S. thrives in the open floor. 
Coupled with a blowout win over Serbia to start group play, the U.S. has been taking care of business to start the Paris Games. It will wrap up group play versus Puerto Rico on Saturday. Rohan Nadkarni is a sports reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_62,"In battleground Pennsylvania's 'Latino belt,' undecided voters are paying attention",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/battleground-pennsylvanias-latino-belt-undecided-voters-are-paying-att-rcna164526,2024-08-01 07:00:02.744911,,"READING, Pa. — In this majority-Latino city, brothers and barbers Samuel and David Delacruz said that lately, the talk of the town is politics — and they're newly energized to cast their ballots.   
The brothers, who are of Dominican descent, first spoke to NBC News before former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt in the state and before he announced his pick of Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate — and before Vice President Kamala Harris became the de facto Democratic presidential nominee.
""Wow. It’s been exciting. It’s been such a unexpected change,"" Samuel Delacruz said of the changes in the national political scene. He said Harris ""has direction, and it evens the playing field between the two candidates."" 
Samuel Delacruz and his brother David are firmly undecided about who to vote for in November’s elections. 
The population of Reading is 67% Latino, and it's one of the cities and towns referred to as the state's ""Latino belt.""
Both parties are paying attention to this battleground state's growing number of Latino voters. 
In 2020, Joe Biden won the state by 80,000 votes; that same year, more than 610,000 Latinos were eligible to vote in the state. While Biden won Reading by about 46 points in 2020, Trump saw a 15-point gain there compared to 2016.   
Last month, Latino Americans for Trump touted the opening of a Trump campaign office in Reading, while the Biden and now Harris campaign told NBC News it has 24 offices throughout the state.  
Jamell Garcia, 18, a student at the brothers' Berks Barber School, will be voting in his first election. According to UnidosUS, 1 of every 5 Latino voters this year will be casting ballots for the first time. 
He said he wasn't sure who he was voting for yet, and he was feeling ""kind of nervous"" about the prospect of casting his ballot for one of the presidential candidates. 
Milves Teresa, a paralegal, said she voted for Biden in 2020 but will be voting for Trump this year, citing her frustrations over the high cost of living and the cost of running a business. Tanya Melendez, who works for a nonprofit, said she will be voting for Harris, citing the fact that Harris came to the area last year and spoke at the local community college.
Restaurant owner Cesar Lopez also recalled the Harris visit, but said he hasn't made up his mind about who he'll vote for. 
""I think everybody is waiting for the next debate,"" he said. ""Let's see what happens.""George Solis is a national correspondent with NBC News.

Former President Trump said Tuesday that he thinks decisions in the White House are being made by a group of ""fascists, communists"" and ""Marxists.""
""I'm the opposite of a threat to democracy — they're a threat to democracy,"" Trump said of Democrats on ""The Ingraham Angle."" ""I mean, look at what they just did.""
Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that Democrats participated in a ""coup"" by replacing Biden at the top of the 2024 ticket with Vice President Kamala Harris months after millions of primary voters cast their ballots.
""They took the presidency away. His wife didn't want it to happen. They took the presidency away like he was a child,"" he told Ingraham. 
Ingraham asked Trump who’s running the country while Harris hits the campaign trail and President Biden faces concerns about his mental acuity.
""A group of people that are fascists, communists, Marxists,"" Trump said in part, adding that they ""circle"" the Oval Office and Department of Justice.

""You're saying Biden isn't making any of the big decisions?"" Ingraham asked. 
""I don't think so, no. I don't think he knows he's alive,"" Trump responded.

Ingraham noted Harris, in her X bio, states her pronouns as she/her. 
""What are your pronouns?"" she asked Trump.
""I have no… I don't want pronouns,"" he said. ""I don't want pronouns… Nobody even knows what that means. Ask her to describe exactly what that means.""
TRUMP SLAMS OPENING CEREMONY OF 2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: ‘THOUGHT IT WAS A DISGRACE’

The 2024 GOP nominee said the country needs to be brought back to ""sanity"" because the Democratic Party is going ""crazy.""
Trump said Republicans want low taxes, good education and the American Dream for younger generations. 
""We want the American Dream for our children. I want the American Dream. I want my children to say, ‘Man, this is great.’ You don't even hear about the American Dream anymore.

Fox News host Sean Hannity discusses how Kamala Harris' campaign is suddenly trying to alter her stance on many major issues on ""Hannity."" 
SEAN HANNITY: We begin with an important message from the Harris campaign. They have kindly now requested that every American disregard anything and everything pretty much Kamala Harris has ever said and done. 
And instead, they want you to focus on their candidates' sudden, miraculous election year conversions on massive, major issues. Here's a whole new person now. Apparently amazing. What a transformation. In fact, today in Atlanta, Kamala well sported a brand new southern accent. Very impressive. I lived in Georgia for years.

FOX_3,IDF kills Hezbollah commander behind brutal attack on children's soccer field: officials,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-kills-hezbollah-commander-brutal-attack-childrens-soccer-field-officials,2024-07-31 09:00:02.778514,politics,"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the response from Israel to the deadly rocket attack on 'Special Report.'
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday announced the death of Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah commander who was behind a drone strike that killed 12 children and teens over the weekend.
Shukr, who was also known as Hajj Mohsin, joined Hezbollah in 1985. He was also sought by the U.S. government over his connection to the 1983 suicide bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beruit that killed 241 U.S. service members.
Shukr served as a senior adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah at the time of his death in an IDF strike on Tuesday in southern Beirut.
The IDF confirmed the news in a press release, announcing that its fighter jets ""eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organization's most senior military commander [Shukr]"" in Lebanon's capital city.
Hezbollah has not confirmed that Shukr is dead.

""As the Head of Hezbollah's Strategic Unit, Fuad was responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs,"" the release said. ""He was responsible for force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel.""
Recently, Hezbollah killed a dozen children on a soccer field in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in a rocket strike on Saturday. Hezbollah has denied involvement, though the IDF and U.S. military dispute that claim.
The strike infuriated Israeli officials, prompting the IDF to launch missiles at Lebanon shortly after. One missile struck an apartment building next to a hospital in the Haret Hreik neighborhood of Beirut.

A senior Israeli official told Fox News earlier on Tuesday that Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant was in contact with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin regarding the present situation. 
""This was about sending a clear message. We don’t want to see a wider war,"" the source said. ""Now this is in the hands of Hezbollah. Within 24 hours after the rocket attack in the Golan Heights, this response was being discussed among other options.""
On X, Gallant said Shukr ""has the blood of many Israelis on his hands.""
""Tonight, we have shown that the blood of our people has a price and that there is no place out of reach for our forces to this end,"" he added.

FOX_4,Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reportedly assassinated,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated,2024-07-31 13:00:02.778514,world,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard announced Wednesday, but nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Israel was immediately blamed for the assassination after pledging to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders over the terrorist group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State, which killed 1,200 people and roughly 250 others were abducted, according to The Associated Press.
Haniyeh was in Tehran for Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's swearing-in on Tuesday. Pezeshkian was sworn in with chants of ""Death to America, Israel.""
On Tuesday morning, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted on the social media platform X that he met with Haniyah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement Secretary General Ziyad al-Nakhalah.

Iran did not provide any details on how Haniyeh was killed. The incident is under investigation.
Analysts on Iranian state television immediately cast blame on Israel for the assassination.
Israel did not immediately comment, but it usually does not make public comments on assassinations carried out by their Mossad intelligence agency.
""The fact that such a high ranking Hamas leader was assassinated on Iranian soil was an added bonus for Israel particularly directly after he participated in the inauguration ceremony of the new Islamic Republic president,"" Lisa Daftari, Middle East analyst and editor-in-chief at The Foreign Desk, told Fox News. It sends a clear message that Israel does not differentiate between the Islamic Republic and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.""
""We have seen Israel conduct very targeted and strategic hits against key players in the Islamic Republic such as nuclear scientists,"" Daftari continued. ""We've also seen Israel conduct targeted hits on weapons depots and other critical infrastructures in Iran, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Given the numerous threats that surround Israel, it has been forced to use its military and intelligence capabilities to pinpoint direct threats and to strategically eliminate them. We assume at this point that the assassination of Haniyeh was made by the same calculations.""
Hamas said Haniyeh was killed ""in a Zionist airstrike on his residence in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of Iran’s new president.""
""Hamas declares to the great Palestinian people and the people of the Arab and Islamic nations and all the free people of the world, brother leader Ismail Ismail Haniyeh a martyr,"" the statement said.

The group, in another statement, cited Haniyeh as saying that the Palestinian cause has ""costs"" and ""we are ready for these costs: martyrdom for the sake of Palestine, and for the sake of God Almighty, and for the sake of the dignity of this nation.""
Haniyeh left the Gaza Strip five years ago and was living in exile in Qatar. The top Hamas leader in Gaza is Yehya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attack against Israel.

FOX_5,Delaware Republican running for governor aims to flip one-party rule in Biden's home state after three decades,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/delaware-republican-running-governor-aims-flip-one-party-rule-bidens-home-state-after-three-decades,2024-07-31 17:43:06.418004,politics,"Mike Ramone, a Republican state representative running for governor of Delaware, spoke with Fox News Digital about his campaign to flip the governor's office to GOP control for the first time in 32 years.
A Republican primary candidate for governor of Delaware, Mike Ramone, said in a conversation with Fox News Digital that he intends to beat what he called one-party rule in President Biden's home state. 
Currently serving as the minority leader of the state House, Ramone said he intends to flip the governor's office red for the first time in more than three decades come November. 
""Delaware has been controlled by one party for 32 years. And I am here to give Delaware a choice,"" Ramone said. ""Balance brings discussion and discussion brings vetting, and vetting avoids unintended consequences…. There is the far red and the far blue that both will be out to vote. But I believe that many far-blue might even consider that they can do better also in the state of Delaware."" 
Under Democratic leadership, Ramone argued that Delaware has morphed into one of the worst states when it comes to education, health care, safety, traffic, and business friendliness. 
He said it's the only state in the nation that had negative GDP. 
""We need to go back to line item reviews of every single expense we make because we're spending people's taxes. It's not our money. It's their money. And I do think Ronald Reagan had it best, you know, ‘Are you better off today than you were then?’ And if people feel they're better off, we won't have a Republican,"" Ramone said. ""But if they feel that they're tired of the drama in politics, if they feel they want to have a leader who leads from the front but supports from the back, if they feel that it's time to move into the technology and the job development in fintech, in pharma, in other aspects like Pete DuPont did for our state when he moved us into being the corporate capital of the world, then they're going to vote for Mike Ramone. They're going to vote for a business person.""
Ramone, who has more than 40 years of experience in the business sector, said Delaware voters need to consider ""management style"" when electing their leaders.

""The way we manage our state currently is dysfunctional. Our education system is one of the highest funded and one of the lowest in results. Our health care system is absolutely havoc-ridden,"" he said. ""I do not believe digesting hatred or negativeness or tainting facts is something I will ever be part of … I just think there are so many things we can do better. We need to stay focused. We need to create a vision."" 
According to latest voter registration data available this month, Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two to one in the state. Delaware also has about 16,600 more independent voters than registered Republicans, and Democrats currently control nine statewide offices. Additionally, Ramone's campaign comes at a pivotal point nationally after Biden exited the presidential race. 
""Joe Biden. We are all proud of Joe. I'm a Republican, and I can say that because he's the first Delawarean to ever become a president of the country,"" Ramone said. ""And I think that's just wonderful. However, I don't think the style of leadership we watched in the last years of presidential campaigns and so forth are what's indicative of Delaware."" 
Mike Ramone said Delaware has one of the highest funded and lowest performing education systems in the country.  (Mike Ramone Campaign )
Ramone, who first went into business at age 20, taking out an $8,000 loan to open his first flower shop, said he’s willing to put his reputation on the line to run the state in a way that’s ""fiscally responsible"" again. 
Delaware lost the three c’s – credit cards, chemicals and cars – when two major car manufacturers, the juggernaut DuPont, and MBNA closed their doors, Ramone said. 
He argued the state has the ideal location to become a fintech hub with Silicon Valley-esque initiatives to bring higher-paying jobs in different sectors to the state, not what he called the ""$15 Amazon jobs."" 
Ramone described education as a ""catastrophe"" in the state, arguing that most funding gets tied up in administration in the state’s 19 school districts and department of education, rather than being used in classrooms.
First elected to the state House 16 years ago, Ramone has survived eight separate elections to hold onto his district, which has more registered Democratic voters per capita than the state has as a whole. 
DEMOCRAT GOVERNORS REEL FROM BIDEN'S PUTIN-ZELENSKYY GAFFE, IMPLICATIONS FOR US LEADERSHIP ON WORLD STAGE
Mike Ramone is running as a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Delaware.  (Mike Ramone Campaign )
""My belief is simple. My district is 8,000-something Democrats,"" Ramone said. ""It's somewhere around 5,000 Republicans and around 5,200 independents. I'm the only elected official lucky enough to be reelected eight times in the state of Delaware, representing the third party, not the second party. I was in the minority minority. There's more independents than Republicans, so I think I have a pretty good feel of building relationships. I think I have a pretty big feel of listening, and I think I have my fingers on the pulse of what Delaware is about. Delaware is a state that has an enormous amount of people who are fiscally reasonable, financially conservative, and socially moderate to liberal. In other words, leave people alone. Let them live their lives. But don't clobber me for taxes and have overzealous government."" 
A father and grandfather, Ramone said he intends to make Delaware a state where younger generations can afford to live and prosper, instead of having to move elsewhere. 
Delaware's last Republican governor was Mike Castle, who served in the position from 1985 to 1993.
Despite running during a presidential election year, Ramone said he believes his resume and business acumen will win him the governor's office. 
""When I ran in my district, Mike Ramone signs were right next to a lot of Joe Biden signs, Mike Ramone signs right next to a lot of Donald Trump signs and Mike Ramone signs were in a lot of yards with no signs. So Delaware is small enough that I believe the national rhetoric may involve a higher level of turnout. But I don't believe that turnout will help nor hurt me,"" Ramone said. 
Mike Ramone promised to make Delaware a state where his grandchildren can afford to live and thrive.  (Mike Ramone Campaign)
Any traction for former President Trump in Kent and Sussex counties, Ramone argued, would be offset in New Castle County, where more Democrats would be motivated to bring out the vote against Trump. 
""I think it's almost what you call revenue neutral. I think it's going to offset itself. I'm not worried about what goes on nationally. I'm worried about what goes on in my community, in my state, and in each one of our three wonderful counties,"" Ramone said. ""You get into these campaigns, and they get so busy throwing bombs at each other, they forget to say why they should even be there. I'll be focused on why I should be there. I'll be focused on what I can do to help people. I will be focused on making Delaware a better place to live."" 
In Delaware, the governor's office is term limited, so current Democratic Gov. John Carney cannot run for re-election this year.

Ramone will still need to advance through the Sept. 10 Republican primary. 
Jerry Price, a former New York Police Department officer, first announced his GOP bid for governor of Delaware in December. Ramone entered the primary race in May, and a third Republican, Bobby Williamson, launched his bid just earlier this month. For Democrats, current Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long and New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer are competing in the gubernatorial primary.
The winner from each party will face off in the Nov. 5 general election.

FOX_6,Leonard Leo says efforts to ‘delegitimize’ Supreme Court through media attacks are meant to undermine rulings,https://www.foxnews.com/media/leonard-leo-efforts-delegitimize-supreme-court-through-media-attacks-meant-undermine-rulings,2024-07-31 17:01:06.418004,politics,"Leonard Leo told Fox News Digital that Democrats and their media allies are working to undermine the Supreme Court.
EXCLUSIVE -- Conservative activist Leonard Leo says Democrats and liberal media outlets working to ""delegitimize the Supreme Court"" are simply attempting to undermine its rulings. 
""The effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court has now been going on for, probably three or four years, and I think it really reached a peak right after the Dobbs case was decided, and in the run-up to it,"" Leo told Fox News Digital. 
""Democrats in the Senate knew full well that when a number of these conservative justices were appointed, and confirmed, that they were going to render decisions in big cases like abortion, religious freedom, the Second Amendment, they were going to render decisions in those cases that hard-left billionaire donors and advocacy groups on their side didn't like,"" Leo continued. ""And ultimately, they lost those confirmations. The left groups that they’re in bed with have lost a lot of these cases."" 
In 2022, the Supreme Court famously overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ending recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and giving individual states the power to allow, limit, or ban the practice altogether. The ruling, which came in the court's opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, put a target on the Supreme Court, and it has since been attacked on a regular basis by Democrats and their allies in the media.

Leo, an influential fundraiser and legal activist known for his work with the Federalist Society that has helped shape the conservative judiciary and who has attracted enormous media attention and hostility, believes efforts to ""tear down"" the court are attempts to delegitimize its rulings.
""It's very unfortunate because this is an institution that's very important in our country. I think all of the justices – conservative as well as liberal – are deciding these cases based on their view of the law,"" Leo said.
""They're not making decisions based on some form of undue influence or conflict of interest,"" he added. ""I don't think any justice on the court is doing anything but trying to faithfully interpret the law as they see it."" 
Leo said he feels ""justices on the liberal side of the court spectrum get it wrong,"" but that doesn’t mean they have bad intentions. 
""I think they are trying to do the same thing that conservative justices are doing, interpreting the Constitution as they believe a judge should,"" he said. 
JUSTICE THOMAS ALLY PENS SCATHING WSJ OPINION PIECE DETAILING ‘ERRORS AND DECEPTIONS’ IN RECENT REPORT
Leonard Leo is ""very troubled"" by the way media outlets have covered the Supreme Court. (Fox News Photo/Joshua Comins)
Leo is ""very troubled"" by the way media outlets have covered the Supreme Court and its work over the years for a variety of reasons. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow has called it ""flagrantly corrupt."" Ex-MSNBC host Keith Olbermann called for the entire institution to be ""dissolved"" for overturning the banning of former President Trump from the Colorado ballot, and those attacks are just the tip of the iceberg.
""First of all, many of the stories that get written about the court's work are couched in terms of what the outcome of the case is, and whether people like or don't like the particular outcome of a case,"" Leo said. 
""And that's not really what the work of the court is all about. The question isn't whether you like or don't like a particular outcome. The question is what the law calls for,"" Leo continued. ""And unfortunately, lots of media reporting treats the court more like it's a legislature or a political institution… and they encourage people to view the court that way, and to think about whether they like what the court is doing or not based on personal preferences, as opposed to what the law calls for."" 
Leo has been the subject of critical coverage himself, due to his influence and prolific fundraising over the years that's helped steer conservative judges to the bench.
MSNBC’s Chris Hayes in 2023 called him ""possibly the most powerful person in the world who almost no one knows about,"" and not in a flattering way.
""If there is one single man… aside from Donald Trump, one single man responsible for Roe v. Wade being overturned, it’s him,"" Hayes said of Leo. 
Leo is regularly criticized by Rolling Stone, which recently referred to him as a ""Supreme Court Puppet Master,"" and several negative profiles have been published about him by liberal news organizations.

""Leo has shaped this Court and acted effectively to keep its Republican justices from abandoning his – and their – sectarian-right vision of America,"" Lawyers Defending American Democracy’s Dennis Aftergut wrote in Salon. 
ProPublica published a more than 9,000-word piece on Leo in 2023, calling him too important to ""ignore."" The New York Times admitted in 2022 that Leo’s success has made ""him a leading target of criticism from the left.""
""Trump Isn't Remaking The Supreme Court. Leonard Leo Is,"" blared HuffPost in 2018. The Guardian once called him the ""architect of the rightwing takeover of the American judiciary.""
Asked how he felt about being in the media's crosshairs, Leo simply praised the team effort across more than a generation to bring textualism back to the judiciary. He said it was the success of the movement that's motivated President Biden's radical overhaul efforts he announced this week for the Supreme Court, which would include term limits and a new ethics code for justices.
""I think the effort within the conservative movement to transform the Supreme Court and the federal courts and to bring it back to the Constitution, as it was originally understood, has been an enormously successful team effort, going all the way back to Ronald Reagan in the 1980s,"" he said. ""And so what we've seen today on the court, these decisions that the Democrats are very upset with and what's motivating the Biden ethics and term limits roll out, what you're seeing is really the culmination of many, many years of hard work by many conservatives going all the way back to Ronald Reagan. It's probably the greatest success story of the modern conservative movement..""

Leo is also irked that recent media coverage harped on issues like flags flying outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas being accused of accepting lavish gifts that influence his decisions. Their spouses have come in for attacks as well.
""There have been all these stories about ethics and undue influence and hospitality and flags, and, you know, the various justices’ wives might fly,"" he said. 
""The problem with all of this is, it creates this atmosphere of scandal. But where's the smoking gun? Where's the set of decisions that came out differently because the justices' wives are conservative, or because there's been some undue influence, or some external pressure,"" Leo added. ""Where's the smoking gun?""

FOX_7,Hamas leader Haniyeh assassination: Foreign governments condemn attack,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hamas-leader-haniyeh-assassination-foreign-governments-condemn-attack,2024-07-31 17:20:06.418004,world,"Former DIA intelligence officer Matt Shoemaker discusses the death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh on 'Fox News Live.'
Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Iran on Wednesday, and several foreign governments criticized the attack as a ""heinous crime"" that will ""lead to further escalation of tensions"" in the region.
Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but Israel was quickly blamed after pledging to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders over the terrorist group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish State.
Israel did not immediately comment, but it usually does not make public comments on assassinations carried out by their Mossad intelligence agency.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said it is ""Iran's duty to avenge Haniyeh's blood because he was martyred on our soil.""

""We will make the terrorist occupiers regret the cowardly assassination, we will defend our honor,"" Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said.
Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said: ""Haniyeh's martyrdom in Tehran will strengthen the deep and unbreakable bond between Tehran, Palestine, and the resistance.""
The Hamas leader's son, Abdul Salam Haniyeh, said his father ""survived four assassination attempts during his patriotic journey, and today Allah has granted him the martyrdom that he always wished for.""
""He was very keen to establish national unity and strived for the unity of all Palestinian factions, and we affirm that this assassination will not deter the resistance, which will fight until freedom is achieved,"" he added.
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said: ""This assassination by the Israeli occupation of Brother Haniyeh is a grave escalation that aims to break the will of Hamas and the will of our people and achieve fake goals. We confirm that this escalation will fail to achieve its objectives.""
""The assassination of Haniyeh will be met with a harsh and painful response,"" Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said.
Deputy Russian foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov called the attack ""an absolutely unacceptable political murder, and it will lead to further escalation of tensions.""
""Qatar strongly condemns the assassination of Dr. Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and considers this a heinous crime and a dangerous escalation, as well as a major violation of international and humanitarian laws,"" the Qatar Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
""The foreign ministry affirms that this assassination and Israel's reckless, continuous targeting of civilians in Gaza will push the region into a circle of chaos, as well as limit the prospects of peace.""

The Turkish Foreign Ministry said: ""Hamas is a concept and an institution and not persons. Hamas will continue on this path regardless of the sacrifices and we are confident of victory.""
Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs added, in part, on the social media platform X that Haniyeh ""was a figure who became the symbol of the glorious Palestinian resistance. His cherished memory will live on in the just cause of the Palestinian people.""
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. government would seek to ease tensions but that it would help defend Israel if it were attacked.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold a situation assessment hearing with the heads of the defense establishment on Wednesday in the wake of the assassination. Israel will also increase security at Jewish institutions around the world.

Rep. Lee Zeldin reacts to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech before Congress and comments on VP Kamala Harris’ views on the Israel-Hamas war.
If it weren’t for double standards, Albany Democrats wouldn’t have any standards at all – especially when it comes to ""green"" energy.  
As new reporting shows, New York's renewable energy plans have been decimated, highlighting a disconnect between radical policy proposals and real-world execution. 
In 2019, New York state set a whimsical goal of reaching a renewables target of 70% by 2030. But in a new report that serves as a devastating blow to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s agenda, the state now admits they are on track to massively miss that target – and not by a small margin.

New York is on pace to reach just a 44% renewables target by 2030.  
US ENERGY FUTURE 'UNDER THREAT' FROM BIDEN POLICIES: GOP REPORT
Hochul’s administration now wants to push the renewables deadline to 2033. Three additional years won’t get them there either. 
But New York realizing (and admitting) they’re not on track to meet their ""green"" goals has not stopped them from trying to enforce those same goals on private companies.  
Earlier this year, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against a beef producer, JBS USA, for allegedly misrepresenting the environmental impact of their production and misleading consumers by claiming that the company would ""achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040."" 
NEW YORK CLIMATE LAW DEFINES RITZY COMMUNITIES WITH MILLION-DOLLAR HOMES AS 'DISADVANTAGED'
It’s the height of hypocrisy that the state is now targeting JBS for allegedly misleading consumers for coming up short of that 2040 trajectory while the state itself is also failing to meet their own unattainable goals. 
Instead of admitting that the state is guilty of misleading New Yorkers, New York is now coming up with their own excuses as to why they’re failing to meet their objectives. 
They’re blaming a variety of factors like ""supply chain disruptions"" and ""geopolitical developments."" Another attempted excuse from the state is that developers backed out of contracts amid record high ""Bidenflation"" and rising costs. 
BLUE STATE DELIVERS CRIPPLING BLOW TO GREEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, JEOPARDIZING BIDEN'S CLIMATE GOALS
The state expects private companies to meet standards they themselves will not achieve. And instead of recognizing the flaws in the Hochul plan and abandoning the unattainable goals and counterproductive net zero targets, they are doubling down by attempting to enforce them on private companies. They should be embarrassed by their rank hypocrisy. 
Further, their failures undermine their credibility to sue others for similar shortcomings, but it also calls into question the practicality of these renewable energy and net zero targets. 
If Hochul wants to present a serious energy plan for New Yorkers, it should be based on energy abundance, affordability, choice, innovation, reliability and common sense – not on unattainable, counterproductive goals pushed by radical environmentalists that don’t work in the real world and ultimately hurt New Yorkers. 
CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER
All of this only underscores the need for reliable energy and the need to reverse the state’s ban on the safe extraction of natural gas.  
Not only would reversing the ban on natural gas extraction help create more jobs in the Southern Tier, but it would also revitalize communities, drive down energy costs, and provide an abundant source of reliable energy for the entire country. 
As these renewable deadlines approach, we can expect Hochul's administration to continue to move the goalposts rather than addressing the underlying problems.

New York policymakers failed to foresee the economic conditions impacting renewable energy’s viability. Ultimately, New York's shifting timelines reflect poorly on the state. 
The bottom line: New York's lofty climate goals are little more than political posturing and an embrace of a ""rules for thee, but not for me"" mindset. Our leaders must make serious course corrections focused on achievable targets, a sincere commitment to sustainable energy practices, and an all-of-the-above approach that strengthens our workers and gives our job creators the best opportunity to succeed.

FOX_9,Biden-Harris aided illegal immigrants and made Americans pay for it,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-harris-aided-illegal-immigrants-made-americans-pay,2024-07-31 17:00:06.418004,opinion,"'Outnumbered' panelists sound off on the left's narrative after President Biden tasked her with leading efforts to stem migration at the southern border in 2021.
It was at the top of the agenda at the GOP convention: 12 million illegal immigrants have entered the country over the last four years. Cities from Denver to New York City have pulled resources from Americans to reward individuals who came here illegally with free housing, education, activities and universal health care.  
But these policies – supported by then-Senator Kamala Harris – have financial costs and human consequences, and those should not be borne by the American patient or American taxpayer. Yet six states plus D.C. use creative accounting and financing gimmicks, under the guise of ""compassion,"" to do just that.  
Beginning on January 1, 2024, California’s SB 184 allows all illegal immigrants, including those ages 19-64, to qualify for the state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. After its passage, Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom bragged that California would be the first state in the nation to provide universal health coverage, regardless of immigration status.  
FEARING TRUMP VICTORY, NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN SETS OFF TOWARDS US BORDER
The change adds, at most conservative, 700,000 adult illegal immigrants living in California’s sanctuary cities to the Medi-Cal rolls and is anticipated to cost $3.1 billion per year. But, by federal law, California cannot use federal taxpayer dollars to fund the program. So how does California pay for it? Federal taxpayer dollars, just laundered with the state’s Medicaid gimmicks.

California’s Medicaid program is the largest in the country, with a proposed budget of $156.6 billion in 2024. But it’s not just California’s taxpayer money that is being spent – it’s federal taxpayers’ dollars. In fact, California spends nearly three federal dollars for every one, state dollar.  
Aligning with California’s decision to spend taxpayer money on health care for illegal immigrants, the Biden-Harris Administration approved a legal loophole to get the federal government to spend more on the California Medicaid program with the expressed purpose to avoid using the state’s dollars on the Medicaid program.  
In the name of compassion, California operated a decades-long expansion of benefits to more and more people. But to do this, they raided payments to health care providers.  The less these providers got paid to see Medi-Cal patients, the harder it was for the disabled or truly needy to see a provider, leading to dangerously long wait times.  
And with 40% of all Californians on Medi-Cal, there are a dwindling number of providers who can financially afford to see a comparatively larger number of patients. In fact, the approved increase in federal funding was to fund higher provider pay; ironically, when Newsom needed money to solve his $45 billion budget deficit, he pillaged provider pay yet again rather than cut universal health care for illegal immigrants.  
No wonder Medi-Cal patients in California have sued their state’s health commission for providing them with substantially worse access to health care than Californians who had different insurance.  
California might be the most egregious example, but isn’t the only state abusing federal dollars – and American patients – to provide universal health care for illegal immigrants. New York also uses Medicaid dollars to provide health coverage to illegal immigrants, under a similar funding scheme.  
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The Biden-Harris administration granted both Washington and Colorado waivers to use the federal Obamacare program for illegal immigrants, despite the law very clearly prohibiting participation of unlawful residents in Obamacare. The administration limited the use of these waivers for innovative health arrangements by states for American patients, but he has allowed states to use them for illegal immigrants. 
Other, little-known federal agencies, like the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) manage the Health Center Program, which provides funding to community health centers that provide low-income Americans access to medical care.  
California’s Medicaid program is the largest in the country, with a proposed budget of $156.6 billion in 2024. But it’s not just California’s taxpayer money that is being spent – it’s federal taxpayers’ dollars. In fact, California spends nearly three federal dollars for every one state dollar.  
The border crisis has put a financial strain on these providers, increasing the need for federal funding and risking their ability to serve American patients. Other programs at HRSA, like the 340B Drug Pricing Program, have been scrutinized for funding subsidized care for illegal immigrants.  
But Republican governors are fighting back – in Virginia, Governor Glenn Youngkin vetoed a health care bill for not including reporting on the usage of programs, like the one above, to provide care to illegal immigrants.

In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis passed a law to require hospitals that participate in the state Medicaid program to merely add in a question on a patient’s immigration status upon emergency room intake. It didn’t force ERs to turn away illegal immigrants, or even force a would-be patient to answer. But the inclusion of the question has reportedly decreased these Medicaid expenditures by 54%.  
Ultimately, the consequences of Democrats’ open borders should not be borne by the American taxpayer – and certainly not the most vulnerable American patient.

Fodor, known as Mrs. Frazzled, regularly makes content where she uses what she describes as a ""teacher voice,"" speaking as if addressing children while correcting people about things like ""mansplaining.""
Though her comments regarding how to address race were the more highlighted portions, Fodor also discussed how to discuss politics with friends and family.

She continued, ""Over half of the people, over half of White people or almost half of White people voted for Donald Trump both times he ran for president. So you know someone you need to talk to. Do it. Maybe don’t hit him with a ‘got it, got it’ or ‘catch a bubble’ like I do in my skits. We can save that for when we are among friends.

Fodor also encouraged the other attendees to not lose hope or get discouraged in their efforts.
""Research tells us that personal connections between friends or family members can be more persuasive than any online debate with a troll or even an advertisement run by a candidate,"" Fodor said. ""So remember I said you are all influencers. However, if Kamala can use Brat, I can say let us touch grass, friends.

Donald Trump and his allies keep talking about a coup.
I don’t quite see what that gets them.
It seems more an expression of frustration than anything else. The campaign spent two years preparing to run against Joe Biden, with frailty and mental acuity an overriding issue, and now they’ve got an energetic, 59-year-old vice president who has not been fully defined the way presidential nominees usually are by this point.
THE ‘WEIRD’ CAMPAIGN: THE STUNNING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HARRIS AND VANCE COVERAGE
In his interview with Laura Ingraham, Trump said: ""They staged a coup against the President of the United States. They went in and they told him, you're leaving. You're way down in the polls, 17 points, I think. It's like you're in a fight with somebody, and you're really winning, and they take him out and they put somebody else in. Nobody ever heard of this before. This is a coup.""
Now I can understand the argument that 14 million people voted for Biden in the primaries and none for Harris — though she was on the ticket with him — and that they have been disenfranchised.
Then the mainstream media and Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi, through increasingly blatant leaks, pressured Biden into stepping aside.
A side-by-side view of former U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. (Getty Images)
But the reason it’s not a coup is that Harris, armed with the president’s endorsement, was the only candidate who emerged. Not one Democrat challenged her. Not Gretchen Whitmer, not Gavin Newsom, not Pete Buttigieg, not Josh Shapiro, not any of the other names that have been bandied about. 
Now that reflects in significant measure the worry about a backlash for passing over the first black woman and Asian-American woman to seek the presidency. Harris also deserves credit for assembling enough delegates to win in just 32 hours. So she ran unopposed. 
JD Vance, in a recording obtained by the Washington Post, told donors in Minnesota that the VP represented a unique challenge.  
KAMALA RIDES TSUNAMI OF POSITIVE PRESS, BUT SKEPTICS SEE A RISKY CHOICE
""All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,"" Vance said. ""The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did…
""Let’s be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about ’em. Love ’em or hate ’em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years. But Kamala Harris, people don’t really know.""
Now that’s candor behind closed doors.

It also underscores that the battle to define the vice president’s image over the next few weeks will make or break her candidacy.
In his first ad since clinching the nomination, airing in battleground states, blames Harris for the mess at the border, with the tagline: ""Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.""
Vance has also had a rough rollout. CNN reports that he said several years ago: 
""We think babies are good because we’re not sociopaths…
THE RACE TO DEFINE KAMALA HARRIS, AS PELOSI ENDORSES HER AND NO CHALLENGERS EMERGE
""And the fact that so many people, especially in America’s leadership class, just don’t have that in their lives.
""You know, I worry that it makes people more sociopathic and ultimately our whole country a little bit less, less mentally stable.""
As for Twitter, ""almost always, the people who are most deranged and most psychotic are people who don’t have kids at all.""
As I’ve argued, the mainstream press seems far more interested in Vance’s history of controversial statements than in Harris’ past ultra-liberal stances, including promoting a bail fund for BLM rioters in 2020.

The New York Times described her old clips and comments as ""weaponization"" by Republicans, as if the media don’t have an obligation to dig as well. 
In other news from the ""Ingraham Angle"" interview:
–Trump made a false accusation against the president on classified documents. ""Now, with Biden, he really was convicted of that case. He was let go of that case. And, by the way, you're talking about many more [documents]. And he didn't have the Presidential Records Act…They said he was incompetent and, therefore, he can't stand trial, and yet he would have been allowed to be president.""
Biden wouldn’t have to stand trial because special counsel Robert Hur declined to bring charges. He voluntarily contacted authorities upon realizing that he had many classified documents from his vice-presidential years and turned them over.
Trump, who was indicted for withholding documents, boasted that the case had been thrown out – by the Florida judge he appointed, Aileen Cannon, who has made many rulings favoring him. That is being appealed.
–He sent mixed signals on the debates, saying he will ""probably"" debate Harris, ""but I can also make a case for not doing it.""
–Trump cleaned up a furor over telling a Christian audience that they won’t have to vote in four years because he will have fixed everything. He said he was telling them ""you never vote. This time, vote. I will straighten out the country. You won't have to vote anymore. I won't need your vote. You can go back to not voting.""
–The former president said Harris ""got rid of the laugh. I noticed I haven't seen that crazy laugh that she's got. She's crazy. That laugh, that's the laugh of a crazy person.""

""It sends a clear message that Israel does not differentiate between the Islamic Republic and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah,"" she added.
HARRIS SAYS ISRAEL HAS RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AS IRAN, RUSSIAN AND LEBANON CONDEMN IDF STRIKE ON HEZBOLLAH
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. government would seek to ease tensions, but that it would help defend Israel if it were attacked.
Hamas said Haniyeh was killed ""in a Zionist airstrike on his residence in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of Iran’s new president.""
Hamas declared Ismail Haniyeah a ""martyr."" 
""Hamas declares to the great Palestinian people and the people of the Arab and Islamic nations and all the free people of the world, brother leader Ismail Haniyeh a martyr,"" the statement said.

Haniyeh left the Gaza Strip five years ago and was living in exile in Qatar. The top Hamas leader in Gaza is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel. He remains alive.

FOX_14,Pompeo slams White House after report about Iran's election meddling: 'Weakness and appeasement',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pompeo-slams-white-house-report-irans-election-meddling-weakness-appeasement,2024-07-31 19:01:02.920049,politics,"Former U.S. Treasury Terror Analyst Jonathan Schanzer reacts to the IDF targeting the commander of Hezbollah after an attack killed 12 Israeli children on 'America Reports.'
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called out the White House after a recent intelligence report found that Iran is trying to sabotage former President Trump's presidential campaign, arguing that the Biden-Harris administration's policy of ""weakness and appeasement"" strengthens Tehran.
The findings were revealed during an Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) press briefing on Monday. An official said that U.S. spy agencies ""observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election,"" likely because Iranian leaders want to avoid escalating any conflicts with the U.S. 
The regime is allegedly using ""vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills,"" to spread disinformation. Though the ODNI did not explicitly say that Iran was aiming at Trump, an official said they ""haven’t observed a shift in Iran’s preferences"" since 2020, meaning that Tehran was still targeting the Republican candidate.
Speaking to Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Pompeo said that he was not surprised by Iran's attempts to influence the election. The Fox News contributor explained that Iran was ""isolated, broke, and weak,"" when he left office in January 2021 — and accused the Biden administration of enabling the Iranian regime.

""It is not surprising that the Iranian regime would want to do everything in its power to prevent a second Trump administration,"" Pompeo said.
""The Biden-Harris administration, on the other hand, has pursued a program of weakness and appeasement, and Iran is flush with cash and powerful once more as a result.
The former Secretary of State also said that Tehran ""despises"" American values and expects them to continue interfering with the 2024 presidential election.
""It will do everything it can to meddle in our democracy to support Kamala Harris, who will continue the same policies of weakness and keep the regime rich and powerful,"" Pompeo added.
On Monday, the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran denied the interference allegations.

""Iran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,"" a spokesperson said. ""A significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.""
Tehran has also been accused of a separate plot to kill Trump on July 13, after a gunman shot the former president at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran has called the claims ""unsubstantiated and malicious.""
During a joint hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the FBI's deputy director Paul Abbate said that officials are ""not ruling anything out,"" regarding Iran's possible involvement.

""We have no information that there are any co-conspirators, foreign or domestic, including Iran, related to this, but we're not — I want to be clear — we have no evidence of that,"" Abbate explained. ""We're not ruling anything out. We're looking into all possibilities and leaving our minds open to that.""

FOX_15,Hezbollah terrorists hold ‘massive’ stockpile of Iranian arms security experts warn,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-hold-massive-stockpile-iranian-arms-security-experts-warn,2024-07-31 19:29:02.920049,world,"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the response from Israel to the deadly rocket attack on 'Special Report.'
The Hezbollah terror organization in Lebanon has a ""massive"" armament stockpile that is significantly backed through Iranian financing and shared technological weapons development.
Israel's military carried out a targeted strike that it said killed a high-ranking Hezbollah commander in Beirut on Tuesday following a deadly attack on a children’s soccer field Saturday on Israel's Golan Heights. U.S. and Israeli officials said all evidence pointed to the Lebanon-based terrorist organization despite Hezbollah's denials.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said that the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1 with a warhead containing more than 100 pounds of explosives.

IDF KILLS HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER BEHIND BRUTAL ATTACK ON CHILDREN'S SOCCER FIELD: OFFICIALS
However, the Falaq-1, according to security experts at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), is just the tip of the iceberg of Hezbollah's significant military stockpile to pull from for these types of attacks. 
Along with an estimated 40,000 combatants at its disposal, Hezbollah is believed to have some ""150,000 mortars, short- to long-range unguided rockets, unguided short-range ballistic missiles, and smaller numbers of intermediate-range unguided Scud-B/C/D ballistic missiles.""
Like the rocket used to hit the children’s soccer field, Hezbollah is believed to possess between 40,000-80,000 short-range rockets that ""could bombard northern Israel with saturating fire.""

However, thanks to Iranian assistance in weapons development, the terrorist group is also capable of reaching cities deeper into Israel.
MASSACRE BY IRAN'S TERROR PROXY HEZBOLLAH COULD LEAD TO FULL-BLOWN WAR IN MIDEAST
""When Hezbollah first became a rocket threat in 1983, one of the IDF’s chief operational goals was to push the group 40 kilometers north of the border,"" authors of the FDD report titled ""Analysis: A greatly expanded arsenal means this is not the Hezbollah of 2006,"" said. ""Hezbollah’s increased medium and long-range fires capabilities mean Israel can no longer rely on strategies that simply push the group north beyond the ranges of its arsenal.""
""The IDF would need to push Hezbollah’s forces north of Tripoli to prevent its reach into Israel,"" the report added.

Hezbollah reportedly relies on an integrated network of subterranean facilities to store its arsenal, all of which are located under or near populated areas in southern Lebanon, the capital city of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley – an area near Lebanon’s shared northeastern border with Syria. 
""This situation presents serious challenges for the Israel Defense Forces and underscores Israel’s requirement for sufficient quantities of munitions to defend its citizens and defeat Hezbollah in a major war that could come sooner rather than later,"" the report found.
Attacks by Islamic terror groups against Israel have drastically increased following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel which triggered Jerusalem’s retaliatory war in Gaza – including nearly 3,000 attacks levied against the Jewish state by Hezbollah alone.

Significant amounts of civilian casualties in Gaza have prompted the international community to call on Israel to reach a cease-fire agreement and prevent further escalations in the region.  
A spokesperson for the State Department on Tuesday said despite the increasingly escalatory attacks in the Middle East, officials do not believe ""an all-out war is inevitable.""
""That's exactly why we're remaining focused on diplomacy,"" Principle Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters.

Though Richard Goldberg, a senior advisor for FDD who sat on the White House National Security Council during the Trump administration and who has been sanctioned by Iran, argued that war actually might be ""inevitable.""
""But not necessarily today,"" he said. ""Hezbollah has 200,000 rockets, missiles and drones pointed at Israel, ready to inflict a massive amount of destruction on Tehran's orders – perhaps at a time when Israel finally takes out Iran's nuclear program. 
""No democracy can live with that kind of threat on its border,"" he warned.

FOX_17,Biden-Harris border crisis slams Ohio town. Here's how state can fight back,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rural-ohio-town-overrun-illegal-immigrants-heres-how-state-can-fight-back,2024-07-31 19:00:02.920049,opinion,"FOX Business correspondent Madison Alworth takes a look at the financial impact of the migrant crisis on sanctuary cities on 'Special Report.'
Rural America is enduring some of the most devastating consequences of Biden’s border crisis. Springfield, Ohio – a small town of roughly 60,000 residents west of Columbus – is the latest example. Under President Biden’s leadership nearly 20,000 Haitians have resettled there. Now, the community is facing an emergency housing crisis. 
On July 8, Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck sent a letter to Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Tim Scott, R-S.C. – chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs – alerting them to this crisis.
According to Heck, these Haitians have been resettled in the U.S. because of Biden’s parole program, which is supposed to be sparingly used, temporary and ""only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.""

Springfield has experienced a 33% increase in their population since Biden took office because of the surge of illegal aliens crossing our border. In comparison, from 2010 to 2020, Ohio’s population rose 2.3%, and Clark County’s population – where Springfield is located – decreased 1.7%. 
HARRIS FAILED TO COMBAT ‘ROOT CAUSES’ OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, FORMER BORDER PATROL UNION CHIEF SAYS
Setting aside concerns about crime and space in schools, a large and rapid increase in population for a midsize town can be ruinous for its residents, especially when affordable housing is already an issue for Americans nationwide.
Biden’s inflationary economic policies have made owning a home more difficult across the country, but his open border had only exacerbated the housing crisis, especially in places like Springfield.
In addition to competing for housing with millions of illegal aliens, Americans’ taxes are also directed to help immigrants with housing. For example, Michigan provides aliens a ""newcomer rental subsidy"" so they may afford housing. At a time when Americans are struggling financially, the politicians are putting illegal aliens first.
Thankfully, states like Ohio can fight back by enacting laws that make it more difficult for illegal aliens to reside in the state. While some commentators think that Ohio’s rural counties need more immigration, residents in Springfield and across the state can and should request that their politicians develop more responsible policies to protect their state. 
VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR HIT WITH IMMIGRATION AD TYING HIS POLICIES TO HIS 'NEW FRIEND' KAMALA HARRIS
First, Ohio currently does not require use of the E-Verify system, nor does it have a law targeting employers’ business licenses for violating state immigration laws. Developing policies to require E-Verify and suspending business licenses work in tandem and would be a strategic first step since most illegal aliens come to the U.S. for economic opportunities. 
Second, Ohio should adopt policies specifically prohibiting sanctuary jurisdictions. Ohio currently has two sanctuary jurisdictions – Hamilton County and Franklin County. Sanctuary jurisdictions are a threat to public safety because they protect criminal aliens by not communicating or cooperating with ICE. 
Sanctuary jurisdictions also facilitate illegal aliens’ prolonged residence within the jurisdiction, which provides aliens more time to work, send money to their home country, and receive downstream benefits and equities here in the U.S., which aliens use as a shield against deportation. Mississippi has passed model legislation prohibiting sanctuary jurisdictions for illegal aliens in their state.
Third, Ohio does not currently have explicit laws prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving downstream benefits such as driver’s licenses, license plates, or business, commercial, and professional licenses. Complete proof of an alien’s legal status should be presented before obtaining any license. Creating laws with explicit language, like Alabama has done, is necessary to prevent any implications or ambiguity in the law.
FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION SHATTERS US RECORD AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION GOES UNCHECKED: STUDY
Fourth, Ohio should revise their definition of a state resident. Currently, Ohio defines ""resident"" as ""an individual who is domiciled in this state."" The definition should include that state residents are U.S. citizens and lawful immigrants. 
Fifth, Ohio should prohibit non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from obtaining or keeping state and local business licenses, contracts, and grants if they transport or assist with the facilitation of illegal alien smuggling. 
NGOs, including faith-based organizations, have received billions of dollars to facilitate Biden’s mass illegal immigration crisis. While NGOs claim they are helping vulnerable populations, they are really participating in a global human-smuggling operation.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The past three and a half years have seen a growing trend of states passing immigration legislation and joining lawsuits against the Biden administration’s open border agenda. Like other states, Ohio can take more control of preventing illegal immigration within its own state borders to protect Ohioans from the physical and economic adverse effects of mass illegal immigration. 
Springfield’s suffering shouldn’t go unnoticed. If conservatives in Ohio and other states make proactive changes today, they can prevent crises tomorrow.

A trio of Cuban American House Republicans is comparing President Biden to some of Latin America's most notorious autocrats over his proposal to transform the Supreme Court.
Florida GOP Reps. Maria Salazar, Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Gimenez recorded a video earlier this week arguing that Biden's plan falls in line with methods used by former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and current President Nicolás Maduro, whose recent re-election was widely denounced by the international community as illegitimate. 
Salazar said Biden's plan ""is outrageous"" and ""goes against the system, the American exceptionality, that we all enjoy.""

""I mean, look, we've seen this happen in history time and time again. When somebody, for political reasons, tries to change the institutions – the Supreme Court, by the way, has been instrumental in maintaining the rule of law and democracy in this country,"" Diaz-Balart said.
""It is highly dangerous, unacceptable, and that is real threat to democracy and to all of the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States.""
Gimenez chimed in, adding, ""We had a great example of a threat to democracy yesterday, when the Maduro regime invalidated an election and tried, or is trying to, stay in power.""
""What's the first thing that Hugo Chávez did when he became president 24 years ago? He actually reformed the Supreme Court of Venezuela, so he made things legal for himself,"" Gimenez continued. ""Touching the judicial system is one way to maintain power, and so this is really, really dangerous for the national security, for our security, and the security of democracy here in the United States.""

Salazar then jabbed Democrats' warnings that former President Trump represents a threat to democracy, adding, ""The president of the United States is saying that he wants to change the democracy. Not President Trump, but President Biden. So be very careful, because touching the Supreme Court is touching the core of the American system.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.
Biden detailed his plan for a binding code of ethics as well as a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity and mandated term limits for Supreme Court justices in an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Monday.
The plan was near-universally heckled by Republicans, but Biden's Democratic allies, who have been pushing for similar or more radical Supreme Court changes, praised the initiative.

However, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., signaled that any such changes would not be taken up by a GOP-controlled House.
""This proposal is the logical conclusion to the Biden-Harris Administration and congressional Democrats’ ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme Court. Their calls to expand and pack the Court will soon resume,"" Johnson said Monday. ""This dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris Administration is dead on arrival in the House.""

FOX_19,Could Kamala Harris being a cook influence the White House race? The Los Angeles Times investigates,https://www.foxnews.com/media/could-kamala-harris-being-cook-influence-white-house-race-los-angeles-times-investigates,2024-07-31 21:06:02.835095,politics," Fox News host Laura Ingraham reacts to the Democratic Partys efforts to elect Vice President Kamala Harris on The Ingraham Angle.
Vice President Harris’ experience as a cook could be a political asset, a Los Angeles Times article suggested on Monday.
""Food has long been part of politics. It can reveal a bit of personality and connect a candidate with voters. But pitfalls abound. When a culinary moment doesn't work — John Kerry ordering a cheesesteak in Philadelphia with Swiss cheese instead of Cheez Whiz, or Gerald Ford attempting to eat a tamale without removing its corn husk wrapper — a politician can seem elitist or even, yes, chowderheaded,"" it read.
The article continued, ""Harris, though, seems equipped to navigate potential food faux pas, because she harbors genuine culinary expertise, and has for years made it part of her public persona.""
The story cited the vice president’s 2019 YouTube series ""Cooking With Kamala"" where she displayed ""subtle kitchen skills true cooks appreciate.""

SCIENCE MAG TOUTS HARRIS BRINGING SCIENCE EXPERIENCE TO WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE OF HER MOM’S CAREER, GETS TRASHED
""Among her abilities: She can deftly crack an egg with one hand. Moments before a TV interview, she advised a journalist on how to brine a Thanksgiving turkey. She reads cookbooks to unwind and has mused that one day she'll write one,"" it listed.
Though Harris being a cook while campaigning ""flies in the face of norms,"" the LA Times quoted experts listing the benefits if she would embrace becoming the ""best cook to ever serve as president.""
""She really ought to say, 'When I am in the White House, I am going to share recipes with you,’"" Bruce Kraig, author of ""A Rich and Fertile Land: A History of Food in America,"" said. ""It would undercut a lot of the right-wing Americans yelling about getting women back in the kitchen.""
""Some politically minded people would say [to Harris], 'Tamp back on being in the kitchen, because we are fighting an uphill battle running a woman for president,'"" Bennett Rea, whose blog centers on cooking politicians' favorite recipes, said. ""She doesn't seem to be doing that. Her refusal to set that part of herself aside speaks to how important it is to her.""
Some people suggested Kamala's cooking experience could be a strategy for right-wing voters. (Getty Images)
Rea also agreed it could help sway right-wing Donald Trump voters who value traditional roles.
""That's the thing his supporters love,"" she said. ""It could be a strategy.""
Last week, the outlet Scientific American became the subject of mockery on social media for publishing a piece saying that Harris will bring a scientific perspective to the presidency if she wins because her mom was a cancer researcher.
The headline of that article read: ""What a Kamala Harris Presidency Would Mean for Science."" The subhead added: ""As the daughter of a cancer researcher, Kamala Harris would bring a lifelong familiarity with science to the presidency, experts say.""

Some conservative X users mocked the L.A. Times cook article as an odd way of promoting Harris.

FOX_20,Kamala was a rogue Soros-like prosecutor before it was popular among woke elites,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-rogue-soros-like-prosecutor-before-popular-among-woke-elites,2024-07-31 21:01:02.835095,opinion,"Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo weighs in on a report that Biden is to endorse major changes to the Supreme Court and Hunter Biden wanting his tax and gun cases tossed.
Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign advertises her as the good prosecutor, to distinguish her from former President Trump, whom they brand as the bad felon. 
As San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011 and California’s attorney general from 2011 to 2017, Harris has willingly – nay, eagerly – participated in the destructive criminal justice policies that have ruined the Golden State. 
She is giving the Trump campaign a gift if she continues to rely on her terrible law enforcement record.

In San Francisco, she was a rogue prosecutor long before George Soros started funding the soft-on-crime DAs who have wreaked havoc in our cities. She made a centerpiece of her program the protection of sanctuary city policies that shielded illegal aliens – including those with criminal records – from deportation, prosecution and the death penalty. 
KAMALA HARRIS’ RECORD AS PROSECUTOR IN CALIFORNIA SPELLS ‘TROUBLE’ FOR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: LAWYER
For example, Harris put her personal policy preferences above the law and refused to seek the death penalty for Edwin Ramos Umaña, an illegal alien and MS-13 gang member. He previously had been convicted – but not deported – of crimes such as robbery and assault, including assaulting a pregnant woman. 
On June 22, 2008, Ramos murdered Anthony Bologna, a grocery store night-shift manager, and his two boys, Michael and Matthew, as they were driving home from a family barbecue. Harris’ office dithered over the case and Ramos wasn’t even convicted until after Harris left office three years after the crime. Bologna’s widow and surviving children were forced into witness protection.
Harris again put her personal beliefs above the law when she refused to seek the death penalty against the killer of a police officer. On April 10, 2004, gang member David Lee Hill murdered San Francisco Officer Isaac Espinoza, who was only 29 years old, and severely wounded his partner, Officer Barry Parker. 
Harris publicly announced that she would not seek the death penalty quickly after Hill’s arrest, angering career prosecutors, police officers and Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. In part because of Harris’ opposition to the death penalty, the jury found Hill guilty of second-degree murder, which usually carries a sentence of 15 years to life. Hill only received life without parole because California law imposes a mandatory sentencing enhancement for killing an on-duty police officer.
HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP
Worse yet, Harris showed that her personal views on crime would give way to her political ambitions. 
She flip-flopped in 2014 when a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled California’s death penalty unconstitutional. As California’s attorney general, Harris appealed the ruling, in part making the weird argument that it ""undermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants."" 
She also flip-flopped on ""Jessica’s Law,"" which imposed harsher penalties on child molesters. Harris publicly supported Jessica’s Law in 2006 as San Francisco DA, but then when it became politically expedient, she ordered parole officers to ignore its restrictions on where sex offenders could live.
Beyond Harris’ elevation of her personal views above the law, she has taken delight in abusing her prosecutorial power. For example, as DA and AG she bragged about punishing parents with fines and jail time for truancy if their kids skipped school, along with collateral charges such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor and domestic violence. 
The most vulnerable parents, of course, were those who were low-income, minority and/or disabled whose children attended public schools. Harris bragged that ""as a prosecutor in law enforcement, I have a huge stick,"" in order to frighten these families, and sent homicide and gang prosecutors to schools to scare both administrators and parents. 
KAMALA HARRIS SUPPORTED ‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ IN 2020 RADIO INTERVIEW, BEFORE BIDEN CAMPAIGN SAID OTHERWISE
It didn’t work; according to the state Department of Education, overall truancy continued to rise. 
But perhaps Harris’s worst prosecutorial behavior was fighting to keep innocent people in jail and to uphold wrongful and overturned convictions that had been secured through unconstitutional official misconduct such as perjury, evidence tampering, and hiding potentially exculpatory evidence.
For example, as DA, Harris violated the Constitution when she did not disclose to defense attorneys crucial information about a police laboratory employee who stole drugs from the lab, intentionally sabotaged its work, spent time in an alcoholic rehabilitation center, and had been convicted of assault and domestic violence. 
Harris’ unconstitutional and unethical behavior was so egregious that more than 600 cases were dismissed and thousands more placed into question. The courts condemned her and her office for systemically violating defendants’ constitutional rights. Harris blamed the police and the judge for her choices.

As AG, Harris continued violating the Constitution and defendants’ civil rights. For example, she insisted on keeping an innocent man, Daniel Larsen, in prison for an additional two years after a federal court threw out his conviction and found him ""actually innocent."" Even after Larsen was finally freed, Harris continued to appeal and challenge his release. 
Worse, she did her best to keep Efrain Velasco-Palacios in custody even though the court found that a local prosecutor had inserted a falsified confession into the transcript of a defendant’s statement. Harris argued that the court was wrong to describe it as ""outrageous government misconduct"" that ""shocked the conscience"" because the prosecutor’s evidence tampering didn’t involve ""abject physical brutality."" 
In a similar case, Baca v. Adams, the 9th Circuit slammed Harris at oral argument for defending a wrongful conviction which prosecutors unconstitutionally obtained by putting on perjured testimony from a jailhouse informant and a prosecutor, both of whom lied under oath. The 9th Circuit scolded Harris and her office so badly that she was forced to dismiss the case.

These examples barely scratch the surface of Harris’ failures as the top prosecutor in San Francisco and then California. She has also selectively investigated and prosecuted entities for her own political benefit, failed to protect her female staff from sexual harassment by her top male aide, and overseen thousands of marijuana-related convictions which disproportionately affected Black and Latino communities, all while bragging about her own marijuana use in high school and college. 
The more Harris invokes her prosecutorial record, the more she will raise doubts about her candidacy for the presidency.

Statistician Nate Silver released on Tuesday his first election model since Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee.
Silver wrote in Substack that although Harris is favored to win the popular vote, she is ""a modest underdog to Trump in the Electoral College, risking a repeat of the popular vote-Electoral College split that cost Democrats the 2000 and 2016 elections.""
He added that Harris is in a better position than President Biden was when he was the incumbent challenger. Furthermore, Silver said that Biden had a 27% chance of beating Trump before he withdrew from the race.

Harris quickly coalesced Democratic Party support in the two days after Biden's July 21 announcement that he was ending his 2024 re-election bid against former President Trump and endorsing his vice president.
""Harris will give Democrats a fighting chance,"" Silver wrote.
He added that the trend of Democrats winning the popular vote could continue: ""In fact, she’s a slight favorite over Donald Trump in the popular vote, which Democrats have won in all but one election since 2000. If an election were held today, we’d enter the evening with a lot of uncertainty about the outcome, both because the polling in the pivotal Blue Wall states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) has been close since Biden dropped out of the race and because there’s some intrinsic uncertainty about where the race stands given how much news there’s been lately.""
1 OF THESE 5 DEMOCRATS COULD BE HARRIS' RUNNING MATE

Silver noted that Biden’s 2020 victory showed a large ""Electoral College-popular vote gap"" as he barely won several states despite winning the popular vote.
""But this is still a problem for Democrats, and we show Harris as having a slightly wider popular vote-Electoral College gap than Biden had in his version of the forecast,"" he said.
Silver is notable for successfully predicting 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential election. He also predicted President Barack Obama’s 2012 victory.
As Harris is now considered the party's presumptive presidential nominee, she is reportedly going to pick her running mate by Tuesday.

Chris Coons, D-Del., breaks down President Biden's proposed radical changes to the Supreme Court and his decision to step aside from the 2024 race on 'Your World.'
Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance says he was prepared for the deluge of negative media coverage that came after former President Trump tapped him to be his running mate.
In an interview with NBC News, Vance said he does not believe Trump is disappointed about picking him.
""No,"" Vance said. ""I mean, I knew that when I came out of the gate there was going to be a couple of days of positive media coverage and then immediately they would go and attack me over everything that I had ever said in my life.""
""The price of entry of being on the national ticket and giving me an opportunity to govern is you have to ... take the shots, and so I sort of expected it,"" he added. ""I think that, frankly, the people who’ve made a lot of money and acquired a lot of power screwing the country up are not going to go easily.""

Vance went on to say he would want to target border policy once in office, essentially undoing the work of Vice President Kamala Harris. President Biden tapped Harris to address the flow of illegal immigration in 2021.
THE ‘WEIRD’ CAMPAIGN: THE STUNNING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HARRIS AND VANCE COVERAGE
""It all starts with strength — strong borders, strong families, a strong economy and a strong president,"" Vance said in a recent rally speech. ""Of all of Kamala Harris’ faults, the worst of all is that she left America weak and vulnerable. The entire world now knows that she helped cover up Joe Biden’s declining mental capacity for years.""

""Our adversaries,"" Vance added, ""are licking their chops and the world is in disarray because of weak American leadership.""
Vance also defended comments that Democrats have used to attack him. A highlight was an old interview in which he criticized Harris and various Democratic women as ""childless cat ladies."" He clarified the comment to NBC but did not back down or apologize.
KAMALA RIDES TSUNAMI OF POSITIVE PRESS, BUT SKEPTICS SEE A RISKY CHOICE
""What I was criticizing and continue to criticize is a particular neurosis in American leadership that I think leads people to say crazy things, like you shouldn’t have children because climate change is a threat to the future,"" he told the outlet. ""Climate change may very well be a problem, but it is not a problem that should motivate people to not have families. And I think that attitude is quite damaging. It’s quite destructive.""

This Election Day will be a big one for me personally: It’s exactly the 10th anniversary of my mother’s death, I’ll be six months pregnant with my first child, and our rabidly partisan politics will have everyone talking as though being born or dying is less important than whether your team wins the White House. 
I found out I was pregnant the same day as former President Donald Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts. I heard the heartbeat for the first time the same day as President Biden’s disastrous debate performance. I started writing this piece the same day as Trump’s assassination attempt. 
What a world I get to tell my kid about. What a decade my mom missed. 
‘FRIDAYS WITH KAT’: KAT TIMPF JOINS ‘THE GUY BENSON SHOW’ AND DISCUSSES KAMALA, THE OLYMPICS AND HER DISGUSTING CONCERT EXPERIENCE
I’m glad, before the birth of my first, that I wrote a book (""I Used to Like You Until,"" out in September, available for pre-order now!) telling him or her how not to view the world and those who live in it — that is, through a binary lens.
It’s something my mother also taught me… or, more accurately, showed me. A woman who was such a walking example of Impossible-to-Categorize that I once overheard the nurses at the hospital where she died describe her as ""that lady, the one with all of the pictures of the pope and the dick jokes."" 
Kat Timpf with her mother Anne Marie Ochab Timpf. (Family photo)
I never expected to find myself in this situation. Actually, I’d prepared myself for every outcome but this one: First, I expected that I wouldn’t get pregnant, especially not naturally. Once I did, I expected that I’d probably miscarry. I mean, I am 35, which makes mine a geriatric pregnancy, medically speaking. If you listen to some of the dudes in the comments section, you’d be shocked a 35-year-old woman found anyone to have sex with her at all! 
Finding out I was pregnant was also nothing like I thought it would be. In my imagination, I would wake my husband, who would sit up abruptly, look at the test, and be overwhelmed by this life-changing moment, leading us into a passionate embrace that we’d remember for the rest of our lives. 
The reality? I had a hard time waking him up, and when I finally did rouse him, he said he couldn’t really see the line and rolled back over to sleep. 
For me, too, it was less of an arresting moment, and more of a slow realization: The line kept getting darker. Then a blood test confirmed it. Then a week went by, and then another. We heard the heartbeat for the first time, and then we heard it again. It was never this exciting emotional rush of OMG, WE’RE GOING TO BE PARENTS!!!! Because I was far too aware of all the things that could go wrong to become intoxicated by such an impassioned reaction.
Kat Timpf and her husband Cam Friscia. 
There was also something else working against the possibility of me experiencing all-encompassing astonishment, and that was, well, I was just too damn tired.
Before I got pregnant, I’d heard that the first trimester could be ""exhausting,"" and I thought I could imagine what that might feel like. I have, after all, always pushed the limits of physical possibility. I frequently work for weeks on end without a single day off, including many instances when my touring and television schedules have left me time for just three hours of sleep three nights in a row. On the flip side, I’ve also been one to come home from nights out long past the sunrise. I’ve been both the person heading out to work and the person heading home from the club at the hours when the city sees those two groups of people meet. 
Those two scenarios may seem to conflict, but they have one thing in common: The exhaustion that they left me with was a physical manifestation of things I loved about myself: The Hardest Working Woman I Know, The Most Fun Girl at the Party. Both had always been intrinsic to my identity, and I’d worn them as a badge of honor. 
But pregnancy exhaustion is worse. I’ve had insomnia my entire life, with fears about the future racing through my brain as I desperately try to fall asleep. These days, I’m literally always ready for a nap — even though I might have more to be afraid of now than ever. Like, I’m about to have a baby, and I don’t even know how to hold one!
Before pregnancy, the exhaustion was proof that I was hardworking and fun. Now, as a pregnant woman, I fear I will never be those things again. I see every break I need from work as a sign that I’ve gotten too soft. I see every time I need to decline an invitation because I’m too tired as a sign that I’ve gotten too boring. I fear that I’m losing the exact things I've loved about myself for so long… and all of this only compounded by the realization that it’s not like life’s gonna get any easier once there’s a little dumb human living outside of me that I’m responsible for keeping alive.
It can be really, really hard, and I can be really, really hard on myself. I’m not cut out for this. I’m not any good anymore. I’m lazy. Let me tell you, early pregnancy will have you waking up after a full night of sleep feeling like you just spent 37 straight hours partying in Berlin, not only in terms of exhaustion, but also in terms of emotional stability… that is, having absolutely none at all.
There were moments that I felt so tired and so hopeless that I would just completely break down crying and say: I can’t do this.
So why did I allow myself to get knocked up, even though it’s so embarrassing to get pregnant by a man? For one thing, my husband just absolutely rules as a dude. I never wanted kids before I met him, but meeting him made me feel like it could actually be a cool thing to do. Part of it was feeling like something was missing in my life. Part of it was simply that I was curious. Part of it was that, well, I low-key felt like I had done everything else already. Part of it was, as ridiculous as this sounds, I thought that it would be funny. Not that the baby is a bit — like, except for in the way that everything kind of is, but you know what I mean — but more so that I know there would be lots of laughs along the way, and laughing is my favorite thing about being alive.

Every reason to have a child sounds kind of selfish, doesn’t it? Oh, I was kind of depressed and empty, so I decided to create a whole other human being… forcing them to enter a world where they’ll face these exact torments themselves! But then you’re also called selfish if you don’t have children. The only way around it, it seems, is to be, well, a man.
Anyway! I’m sure that women who have been pregnant before are probably reading this like, ""Yeah, bro. I felt bad too; you’re not special."" But my point in writing all of this is not that I think I’m some kind of unique victim. It’s the opposite!
I feel a sense of unity and solidarity with all the women who have gone through this. If I’m being honest, though, I also feel sadness about there being one woman in particular whom I’ll never be able to share this connection with: my mom. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’m very excited to be pregnant. I’m lucky to be able to do this, and to do it as part of a relationship that has given me the kind of happiness, security, and peace I once doubted could have ever been possible for me. 
I feel a sense of unity and solidarity with all the women who have gone through this. If I’m being honest, though, I also feel sadness about there being one woman in particular whom I’ll never be able to share this connection with: my mom. 
Still, it’s felt cruel, at times disorienting, and a bit unfair to have to try and figure out how to be a mother when I can hardly remember what it’s like to have one. It’s not that I don’t remember her, of course. It’s just that, after Nov. 5, 2014, everything I’ve done, I’ve done without her. I got my job at Fox News without a mom. I got into and out of a seriously abusive relationship with a narcissist without a mom. I became a New York Times bestselling author without a mom. I got married without a mom. 
Ten years later, I am an entirely different person — which is a great thing, as anyone who somehow endured the 20-something version of me will tell you. But the fact that I don’t recognize this person from the past is also to say I don’t recognize the last version of myself that will ever be a person with a mother.
Kat and Cam's dog Carl and cat Cheens are ready to welcome a new baby to the family. 
Ten years is a long time. The fact that it’s really been that long will be at the top of my mind this Nov. 5… all as The Discourse pretends that the only thing worth considering will be the election. 
But guess what? The fact that I’ll have something else on my mind on that day also doesn’t make me a unique victim. Many people will have things on their minds that aren’t politics. 
I do want to acknowledge that Election Day is probably a little easier for me, politically speaking, because I count myself among the millions of Americans who are independent. I am not a Democrat or a Republican, but I do have meaningful relationships with both.

One underlying theme in the new book is the way that politics makes us fight with the people we actually know on behalf of people who don’t even know we exist. As I write in its introduction: ""All too often, we will let a single difference in viewpoint or association be enough to write off another person entirely, even if we know nothing else about them."" Worse? Politicians weaponize this division for the sake of their own power at the expense of our relationships with each other.
Kat Timpf's latest book releases on Sept. 10. 
I’ve faced this firsthand quite a few times. In fact, you might have done it to me as you’ve been reading! Perhaps, my admission that I’m not in either party has angered you, because you think I’d have to be an idiot to not be in yours. There are others still who will see that this piece is on FoxNews.com and think that tells them enough to know that they don’t want to click on it at all. 
I’m not, of course, saying that politics doesn’t impact our lives. It absolutely does! But we also shouldn’t invent unnecessary impacts based on incorrect assumptions.
The stuff that transcends politics, and why it’s so important to transcend politics, is what my new book is about. It’s also something that I also hope to bring to my project after that, which will be, of course, the kid. I want my child to realize, for example, that a woman having a room full of pictures of the pope doesn’t mean she won’t also have some great dick jokes.

And if you’re tempted to judge me for using my pregnancy to sell books? Well, first of all, you read this for free, and I wrote this for $0. Second, babies are expensive, especially in New York City… and also, if it doesn’t sell well, I’ll see it as devastating confirmation of my lifelong fear that I can’t be a mother and a woman with a thriving career at the same time. 
And if you’re tempted to judge me for using my mother’s death? Be careful about judging what you don’t know. Because, chances are, you didn’t know her, and even if you did, you probably still don’t know what she said to me on her deathbed, something I can still hear her say this entire decade later:

FOX_24,IDF reveals 4 reasons why it killed Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-reveals-4-reasons-why-killed-hezbollah-commander-fuad-shukr,2024-07-31 23:35:02.833539,world,"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the response from Israel to the deadly rocket attack on 'Special Report.'
The Israel Defense Forces revealed Wednesday four reasons why it killed Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah commander responsible for a drone strike that left 12 children and teens dead over the weekend in northern Israel. 
Shukr served as a senior adviser to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah at the time of his death in an IDF strike on Tuesday in southern Beirut. The IDF says its fighter jets ""eliminated the Hezbollah terrorist organization's most senior military commander [Shukr]"" in Lebanon's capital city. 
Here’s why Israel’s military says it took out Shukr: 
The IDF says Shukr, who joined Hezbollah in 1985, rose up the ranks of the terrorist group to obtain a position close to its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

""He planned Hezbollah terrorist attacks for 30 years and has Israeli, American, French and other civilians’ blood on his hands,"" the IDF said Wednesday. 
The Israeli military added that within Hezbollah, Shukr was its ""senior advisor for strategic affairs and wartime operations."" 
The IDF alleges that for the past ten months – since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, 2023 – Shukr has been ""orchestrating rocket and UAV attacks"" against Israelis. 
The attacks, they say, have forced ""60,000 civilians in northern Israel to evacuate their homes.""

The Israeli military has been engaged in frequent skirmishes along its northern border with Lebanon. 
The IDF says Shukr was the planner for this past weekend’s deadly Hezbollah rocket attack in the northern Israeli village of Majdal Shams. 
The scenes there on Sunday were ones of sadness, shock and devastation as the residents of the mostly Druze village buried the young victims of the Hezbollah strike that killed at least 12 and injured some 29 others — mostly ages between 10 and 20 as many of them innocently played soccer on Saturday. 
The IDF says Shukr was instrumental in developing precision-guided missiles.

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is reportedly urging Wall Street donors to make their donations immediately due to a rule that limits donations to certain presidential tickets.
Harris' campaign has reportedly been citing an SEC rule that bans some employees of financial institutions from contributing to a presidential ticket that includes a sitting governor, leading many on Wall Street to conclude her pick will be a governor, Axios reported Wednesday.
Harris' campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
The five candidates considered most likely to secure a spot on Harris' ticket are currently Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelley, D-Ariz., Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. If the indications are correct, however, the three governors could be the ones to watch.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 10 days without holding a press conference since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee. 
Harris announced that she'd locked up the nomination late on July 22, declaring that she'd won commitments of backing from a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention. She’s since hit the campaign trail, spoken at various events, and even chatted with reporters here and there, but hasn’t done a formal press conference or wide-ranging interview in the 10 days that have followed. 
Harris, who became the likely nominee without receiving a single primary vote when President Biden announced he would step aside, has been so elusive that The New York Times published excerpts from an interview she conducted last year to see where her answers ""land now.""

Much of the Democratic Party – including governors, senators and House members as well as party leaders – quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden's blockbuster news. But critics have started to take notice that Harris hasn’t faced tough questions since. 
National Review senior writer Noah Rothman asked his social media followers on Wednesday, ""When is Kamala Harris going to hold a press conference?""

NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham expects her to follow President Biden’s 2020 playbook, when he was famously accused of hiding in his basement during the COVID pandemic. 
""Kamala Harris should absolutely hold a press conference. One would expect it when she names her vice-presidential pick. But we cannot expect her to break from Biden's serial avoidance of press conferences,"" Graham told Fox News Digital. 
""Since the 2020 campaign, we have witnessed the bizarre spectacle of Donald Trump granting wide access to networks that suggest he's a fascist and hammer him daily, while Biden and Harris won't grant interviews to media outlets that gurgle all over them and their ‘historic accomplishments,’"" he continued. ""Either they think the press can never be servile enough or they are projecting a complete lack of confidence in their efforts to put complete sentences together.""

DePauw University media studies professor Jeffrey McCall believes the Harris campaign is ""well aware that Biden dodged the media throughout his 2020 campaign and still got elected.""
""The Harris camp is also well aware that their candidate doesn't do well in unscripted settings, not to mention that a presser or legitimate sit-down interview would necessarily require her to defend some of her positions, previous statements and record. Thus, a rerun of the Biden basement campaign sounds pretty good, as long as you throw in a couple of rallies with Megan Thee Stallion,"" McCall added, referring to the rapper who appeared at Harris’ Atlanta rally on Tuesday. 
He suggested that Harris doesn’t feel pressure ""to do a press conference just because she has fallen into the nomination"" because Democrats will support her either way. 
""The supporters rallying around her don't expect her to be accountable and have little interest in her policy positions and so on. That she's not Biden, or Trump, is sufficient for those supporters,"" McCall said. 
""From a rhetorical strategy standpoint, however, it would behoove Harris to actually do a presser and do real journalistic interviews,"" he continued.  ""At some point, it would seem, she'll have to attract moderates or undecided voters who want to see her take questions.""
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FOX_27,Flashback: Harris proposed middle class tax increase for ‘Sanders-lite’ health care plan,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flashback-harris-proposed-middle-class-tax-increase-sanders-lite-health-care-plan,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,politics,"Stagwell CEO and former Clinton adviser Mark Penn joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the accusations that Vice President Harris is 'flip-flopping' on major issues after announcing her 2024 candidacy.
During Vice President Kamala Harris’ run for president in the 2020 election cycle, the then-California senator proposed a new health care plan that had potentially high costs for the American middle class.
An archived version of Harris’ campaign website reviewed by Fox News Digital details her ""Medicare For All Plan,"" which Harris, who personally authored the proposal, promised would provide ""comprehensive health insurance that covers every American.""
Harris cited fellow presidential primary rival Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare For All plan as the model for how to pay for her plan, with the then-California senator specifically pointing to an ""income based premium paid by employers, higher taxes on the top 1%, taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income, among others.""
Harris also provided a link to the Sanders plan, which included a 7.5% payroll tax increase for employers and a 4% increase in income taxes on households making over $29,000.

While Harris praised the Sanders plan for having ""good options,"" she accused the Vermont senator of going too far with the 4% tax increase, instead proposing that the new tax only apply to households making over $100,000.
""I would tax Wall Street stock trades at 0.2%, bond trades at 0.1%, and derivative transactions at 0.002%. Think of it like this: that’s a $2 fee on a $1,000 trade by investors and big banks,"" Harris continued. ""I would also end foreign tax shelters by taxing offshore corporate income at the same rate as domestic corporate income. Together, these proposals would raise well over $2 trillion over ten years, more than enough to make up the difference from raising the middle class income threshold.""
However, the proposed 7.5% bump to employer payroll taxes and 4% tax hike on households over $100,000 was panned by critics, including those who ended up joining Harris in a future President Biden administration.
Then-Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield, who would go on to serve as the White House communications director from 2021-2023, called the plan a ""Bernie Sanders-lite Medicare for All and a refusal to be straight with the American middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.""
JD VANCE ADDRESSES PAST CRITICISM OF TRUMP AFTER HE'S CHOSEN AS VP: 'BOUGHT INTO MEDIA'S LIES AND DISTORTIONS'
Despite Harris’ pledge to target employers and high-income households with the burden, some experts argue the cost would mostly be borne by middle-class workers.
Thomas Savidge, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, told Fox News Digital that any payroll tax increase to employers is likely to be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages.

""The cost of payroll tax increases are ultimately borne by employees,"" Savidge said. ""Increases in payroll taxes on employers take money away that could have been used to increase employee pay, offer better benefits, or hire additional staff.""
Savidge noted that the 4% increase in income taxes would cover a large percentage of the American middle class and would be especially harmful in the current economic environment, where concerns over inflation already have many tightening their belts and spending less.
According to U.S. Census Bureau data, over 37% of U.S. households make over $100,000 and could be impacted by the tax, representing a large chunk of middle-class workers.
THE ‘WEIRD’ CAMPAIGN: THE STUNNING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HARRIS AND VANCE COVERAGE
Savidge also argued that the Harris proposal represents the most ""extreme"" way to tackle American concerns over the cost of health care, noting that such a plan would distort the market while having significant impacts on wait times and quality of care.
""This is an extreme way to go about it,"" Savidge said. ""It’s going to end up making the problems that we have much worse.""
Harris’ current campaign website does not yet include her platform, and the new Democratic nominee also has yet to unveil a new health care plan.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital inquiry on whether Harris stood by the plan or if she would support one similar to it in this campaign.

However, the Harris proposal was slammed by the office of Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who the Trump campaign has touted as its ""policy attack dog on Kamala Harris."" 
""After four years of sky-high inflation rushing household budgets, the last thing the American people need is another tax hike from Kamala Harris, Vance spokesman William Martin told Fox News Digital. ""Her middle class tax increase would hit millions of households, and has drawn comparisons to Bernie Sanders from this in her own party. There is no place for her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda in the White House.""

Kathy Hochul if she was upset by Kamala Harris' VP short-list containing only White men on Wednesday during an interview.
CNN host Kate Bolduan asked Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday if she was upset that all of Vice President Harris' potential vice presidents are White men.
""One thing that is noteworthy that cannot be missed in when we put up the screen of the shortlist, if you will, all of them, most of them, all of them are White men. Most of them are Democratic governors. You are a very prominent, very well-known, and respected Democratic governor yourself. Does it bother you that they’re all White men?"" Bolduan asked the governor. 
Harris' VP shortlist includes Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
Hochul said she wasn't bothered at all and added, ""I don’t want to look at gender here. I really don’t think it’s fair, because we have a lot of talented women governors. I text them all the time. The men are very talented. So that’s the beauty of what we have here, is that we have a lot of talent.""

""So I‘m not going to take offense that she doesn‘t pick a woman or a person, you know, from some particular state at all. Whoever she picks, it’s going to be a dynamic duo. No doubt about it,"" Hochul continued. 
Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, is reportedly close to making a decision on a running mate and will kick off a battleground tour next week. 
The vice president will make appearances next week in key battleground states with her choice of vice president, indicating that she is close to making her decision, Reuters reported.
Former Obama strategist David Axelrod suggested on Tuesday that Gov. Tim Walz was running the most ""aggressive"" VP campaign.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calls out unanswered questions following the Trump rally shooting on 'Hannity.'
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., joined ""Hannity"" after grilling the acting Secret Service director for answers on the security failures at the Pennsylvania rally where former President Trump narrowly escaped assassination. Hawley said whistleblowers have since stated that law enforcement was assigned to be on the roof where the gunman fired. 
TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AFTER SECRET SERVICE FAILURES PROMPTS CALLS FOR DRASTIC AGENT RECRUITMENT CHANGES
JOSH HAWLEY: What whistleblowers tell me is that actually there was law enforcement assigned to be on that roof. I asked the Secret Service director about that today, and he said, 'well, gee, I'm not sure.' And I said, how can you not be sure? Seventeen days have gone by. But here's the reason why: Secret Service hasn't even talked to local law enforcement. They've done zero local law enforcement debrief or interviews since the shootings. Zero. I mean, it just begs the question, what is going on? Are they really trying to get the facts or they're just trying to cover their rear ends? And it sure looks a whole lot to me like the second thing, the American people deserve the truth here. Not whitewashing, not stonewalling, not a bunch of bureaucratic gobbledygook. They deserve the truth and I am not going to stop pushing until we actually get it. 
[…]
I don't trust any of these people to give us the facts. We saw it today. All we get is this stonewalling garbage. I went [to Butler] myself and the FBI came onto the property and said 'we're doing an investigation, you need to get out of here.' To which I said, I don't care what you're doing, I've got my own oversight to do.

Whistleblowers previously told Hawley that a law enforcement officer who was assigned to monitor the roof of a building that would-be Trump assassin Thomas Crooks fired from on July 13 left their post because it was ""too hot.""
Crooks, 20, fired multiple rounds from the roof of American Glass Research (AGR) Building 6, which was outside the rally perimeter but had a direct line of sight to where the former president was standing on stage at his campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
""This comes from a whistleblower with direct knowledge of the Secret Service plan and setup that day,"" Hawley said. ""And what this whistleblower tells my office is that there was at least one law enforcement person assigned to the roof itself. In other words, the plan called for a law enforcement individual to be on the roof at all times during the rally. And that did not happen. And what the whistleblower tells me is the law enforcement individual who was assigned to that roof abandoned it.""

A vocal anti-Israel activist, who has made several donations to Rep. Rashida Tlaib's, D-Mich., House campaigns, mourned the assassination of a top Hamas leader on Wednesday, saying his ""martyrdom is not in vain.""
Zahra Billoo, a disgraced former Women's March leader and the executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in San Francisco, took to social media after it was reported that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, prompting Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to vow ""revenge"" for the attack.
 ""Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead—in fact, they are alive! But you do not perceive it,"" Billoo said in the first part of her post, appearing to quote the Quran. 
""Tonight, we mourn Ismail himself but know his martyrdom is not in vain,"" she continued, using a controversial phrase pushed by anti-Israel activists to mean the elimination of Israel. ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.""
IRANIAN LEADER KHAMENEI SAYS IT'S A 'DUTY TO TAKE REVENGE' AFTER HANIYEH ASSASSINATION

""I mourn yesterday’s martyrs because I can see the horrific path killing peace negotiators leads to,"" Billoo added in a follow-up X thread, accusing Israel of a ""genocide.""
Billoo's initial post immediately drew backlash from social media users, with some people mocking the Quran quote and saying the Hamas leader is definitely ""not alive."" 
""Probably important to remember this, too, whenever you see the name CAIR,"" journalist Bari Weiss said.
Billoo, who has donated almost $1,000 to multiple Tlaib campaigns, has been a lightning rod of controversy in recent years over her anti-Israel rhetoric, which led to the left-wing Women's March board severing ties with her in 2019 after only serving two days. She posted a 25-post Twitter thread at the time blaming her ouster on an ""Islamophobic smear campaign"" and ""right-wingers.""
RASHIDA TLAIB RIPPED FOR HOLDING 'WAR CRIMINAL' SIGN DURING NETANYAHU’S SPEECH: 'ABSOLUTE DISGRACE'
Despite the backlash, Tlaib came to Billoo's defense the day after the ouster, posting, ""#FreePalestine always sis! They won't silence us for speaking out against human rights violations.""
""They will lie, smear our names and call us anti this and that, but we always be pro-humanity & we have the truth on our side. Stay strong,"" she continued.
Several of Billoo's controversial posts were circulating on social media shortly after she was announced as a Women's March board member.
""If you support Israel, you are no doubt supporting baby killers,"" Billoo wrote in one unearthed 2014 post that was circulating ahead of the ouster. In other posts she described Zionism as ""racism"" and said she was a ""proud anti-Zionist.""
""In looking at the tweets in question, I acknowledge that I wrote passionately. While I may have phrased some of my content differently today, I stand by my words,"" Billoo said in 2019 about several of her controversial posts.

Prior to the Women's March controversy, Billoo took a ""selfie"" with Tlaib outside her Washington, D.C., congressional office in early 2019 and said, ""Not all sheros wear capes, some like Rep. [Tlaib] wear Congressional pins!""
""So good to see you sis! I will always speak truth to power because I got you to protect,"" Tlaib responded.
Billoo was also in attendance at a Tlaib fundraising event in California in 2021, according to a Facebook post.
This is not the first time a CAIR leader has ignited backlash on social media. Last December, Nihad Awad, the executive director and co-founder of CAIR, said he was ""happy to see"" the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of Israel and that the Jewish state did not have a right to self-defense because it is an ""occupying power.""
""And yes, the people of Gaza have the right to self-defense — have the right to defend themselves. And yes, Israel as an occupying power does not have that right to self-defense,"" he said.

In addition to Billoo's anti-Israel rhetoric, she has also repeatedly attacked Memorial Day and smeared the U.S. military, questioning why fallen soldiers should be remembered.
""You think we should honor people who commit war crimes?"" she asked in one post.
""Did not and does not celebrate #MemorialDay,"" Billoo posted in a long 2019 thread. ""There cannot be any honor earned through participation in dishonorable wars.""

Former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown was candid about Vice President Harris' chances in the 2024 presidential race in a newly published interview.
Brown, who has been open about his extramarital relationship with Harris in the ‘90s, said he was nervous about the VP’s likability with voters in the weeks before she became the presumptive Democratic nominee.
""Brown worried out loud that Harris had ‘the Hillary syndrome’ — that ‘people don’t like her’ — and fretted it was not fixable,"" Politico reported on Wednesday. 
The interview was conducted before President Biden's disastrous debate and weeks before he dropped out of the 2024 race.

Brown said he was no longer in touch with Harris, according to Politico, but believed Biden should step down immediately to give the country time to see her as president ""before the election."" He also advised Harris to downplay her gender and ethnicity in the presidential race because ""the voters want her to answer them."" 
On her far-left record, Brown suggested she cling to a more vague political platform. 
""If she keeps people continually guessing then she can adjust the interpretation of your guess every time she sees you,"" he told Politico.
The Democratic Party has been energized by Harris' decision to run since Biden exited the race, raising record-setting fundraising amounts for her campaign.

Harris has also enjoyed a dramatic boost in the polls since entering the 2024 race. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted a week after President Biden exited the race, her overall favorability rose from 35% to 43% compared to the week prior, while her unfavorability rating fell from 46% to 42%.
Fox News Digital reached out to Brown and Harris' offices for comment, but did not hear back.

Harris met Brown while at the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in the mid-90s. She went on to date the-then California Assembly Speaker, who is 30 years her senior, while he was estranged from his wife.
Brown also appointed Harris to several well-paid state commissions: the state Insurance Commission, the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and, later, the California Medical Assistance Commission.
In 2019, Brown wrote a column for The San Francisco Chronicle admitting the pair's past extramarital relationship. He also conceded that he helped boost Harris' career, but said that he had also helped other prominent California Democrats like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Gov. Gavin Newsom.
""Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was [California] Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco,"" he wrote at the time.
In 2020, Brown also weighed in on Harris' political career, urging her in a Chronicle column to say no to the vice presidency and aim for a role as attorney general in the Biden administration instead.
He even suggested the position would boost her chances at taking the White House in 2024 or 2028.
""Best of all,"" he wrote, ""being attorney general would give Harris enough distance from the White House to still be a viable candidate for the top slot in 2024 or 2028, no matter what the state of the nation.""

The White House could not confirm reports from Tehran that Hamas' top political leader was killed Wednesday by an airstrike. 
National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Kirby told reporters he could neither confirm nor deny a statement by Hamas that accused Israel of assassinating Ismail Haniyeh. No one has claimed responsibility for the assassination, but Israel is suspected to be behind it after vowing to eradicate Hamas' senior leaders following the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages. 
""I've seen the statement that Hamas put out. I can't confirm or verify. We have no independent confirmation,"" Kirby said during the White House press briefing Wednesday afternoon. 
Neither could Kirby say, when asked, what potential impact the killing could have as the U.S. continues to negotiate a potential ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90,000 wounded in the war in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, although the count does not differentiate between civilians and terrorists.

""I think it's too soon to know what any of these reported events could mean for the ceasefire deal,"" Kirby said. He quickly added that the Biden-Harris administration continues to seek an agreement that would bring an end to the war in Gaza and provide humanitarian relief to the Palestinians who live there. 
""In fact, we have a team in the region right now as we speak, to try to continue to work with our counterparts to move this forward because it's that important,"" Kirby said. 
""It's always been complicated work. And it's not like the complications with every passing day get easier, and that includes today."" 
A U.S. military official earlier told Fox News the American military had ""no involvement"" in the assassination of Haniyeh, who led Hamas' political bureau and had lauded the Oct. 7 attacks as a humiliating blow to Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel ""will exact a very heavy price from any aggression against us on any front"" but did not mention the killing. ""There are challenging days ahead,"" he added.
The alleged assassination has poured gasoline on the conflict in Gaza and threatens to fuel a wider regional conflict in the Middle East — precisely the outcome the Biden-Harris administration hopes to avoid. 
In a statement on his official website, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said revenge was ""our duty"" and that Israel had ""prepared a harsh punishment for itself"" by killing ""a dear guest in our home.""
It remains to be seen if Hamas will withdraw from ceasefire negotiations pushed for by Biden.

FOX_35,Vance brands Harris a 'coward'; Trump dinged for 'attacks and insults' as campaigns war after fiery event,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-brands-harris-coward-trump-dinged-attacks-insults-campaigns-war-after-fiery-event,2024-08-01 06:39:02.749288,politics,"Fox News host Harris Faulkner speaks about former President Trump's address at the National Association of Black Journalists' convention in Chicago on 'The Story.'
The Trump and Harris campaigns mixed it up on X Wednesday afternoon after the former president's heated appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago, and the Republican vice presidential nominee blasted Vice President Harris as a ""coward.""
""Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at Black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency, while he failed Black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Michael Tyler said in a statement after the event.
""Today’s tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies this entire campaign,"" Tyler continued. ""It’s also exactly what the American people will see from across the debate stage as Vice President Harris offers a vision of opportunity and freedom for all Americans. All Donald Trump needs to do is stop playing games and actually show up to the debate on September 10.""
Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, fired back, saying the former president ""walked right into the NABJ conference and showed he had the courage to take tough questions, while Kamala Harris continues to hide from any scrutiny or unfriendly media like the coward she is.""
1 OF THESE 5 DEMOCRATS COULD BE HARRIS' RUNNING MATE
During the event, Trump clashed with ABC News reporter Rachel Scott, accusing her of asking a ""nasty question"" and referring to the Disney-owned network as ""fake news.""
Trump participated in a Q&A with Scott, Semafor reporter Kadia Goba and Fox News Channel anchor Harris Faulkner. The event caused ripples before it began because many Black journalists objected to Trump even being invited in the first place. Once it began, Scott kicked things off by ""addressing the elephant in the room.""
""A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today,"" Scott said. ""You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four congresswomen of color who were American citizens to go back to where they came from. 
""You have used words like animal and rabid to describe Black district attorneys. You attack Black journalists, calling them a loser, saying the questions that they ask are, quote, stupid and racist. You've had dinner with a White supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. So, my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?""

Trump shot back at Scott, saying he's ""never been asked a question in such a horrible manner.""
""I love the Black population of this country,"" Trump said. ""I've done so much for the Black population of this country, including employment, including opportunity zones, with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs ever for Black workers and Black entrepreneurs. I've done so much, you know. And I say this, historically Black colleges and universities were out of money.
""And let me go a step further,"" Trump added. ""I was invited here, and I was told my opponent, whether it was Biden or Kamala. I was told my opponent was going to be here. It turned out my opponent isn't here. You invited me on under false pretense.
""And then you were half an hour late, just so we understand. I have too much respect for you to be late. They couldn't get their equipment working or something.""

""Mr. President, I would love if you could answer the question,"" Scott said, again asking why Black voters should trust him for another term. 
""I think it’s a very nasty question,"" Trump shot back. ""I have answered the question. I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.""

FOX_36,Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei orders 'direct' attack on Israel: report,https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-orders-direct-attack-israel,2024-08-01 06:14:02.749288,politics,"Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on the unrest in the Middle East on 'The Story.'
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has commanded Iranian forces to launch a ""direct"" attack against Israel, according to a report Wednesday.
Three Iranian officials confirmed the situation to the New York Times. The news comes hours after Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran on Wednesday.
The White House has been unable to independently verify Haniyeh's death as of Wednesday afternoon, but Tehran is placing the blame on the Israel Defense Forces, Israel launched a strike on Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday, but has neither claimed responsibility nor denied killing Haniyeh.
""The criminal, terrorist Zionist regime martyred our dear guest in our territory and has caused our grief, but it has also prepared the ground for a severe punishment,"" Khamenei's English-language X account said on Wednesday.

""Martyr Haniyeh was willing to sacrifice his honorable life in this dignified battle for many years. He was prepared for martyrdom and had sacrificed his children and loved ones on this path.""
Commanding Officer of the Israeli Air Force Maj. Gen. Tomer Bar issued an ominous statement later on Wednesday, promising that there is nowhere ""too far"" for Israel to strike if needed.
""The Israeli Air Force defends and operates in all arenas of the war, enveloping the state of Israel with dozens of aircraft, manned and unmanned, ready and prepared within minutes for any scenario, in any arena,"" the statement read. ""We will act against anyone planning to harm the citizens of the state of Israel, there is nowhere that is too far for us to strike.""

Earlier on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his country is in a fight ""against Iran's axis of evil.""
""This is an existential war against a stranglehold of terrorist armies and missiles that Iran would like to tighten around our neck,"" Netanyahu said, later adding that Israel has heard ""threats from all sides,"" after Israel's recent strike against Beirut.
""We are prepared for any scenario, and we will stand united and determined against any threat,"" the leader said. ""Israel will exact a very heavy price for aggression against us from whatever quarter.""

FOX_37,"Reporter's Notebook: A portrait of Middletown, Ohio, home to JD Vance",https://www.foxnews.com/us/portrait-middletown-home-jd-vance-chad-pergram-spent-youth,2024-08-01 06:13:02.749288,opinion,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on calls for unity around Vice President Harris after President Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
""Like most small children, I learned my home address so that if I got lost, I could tell a grown-up where to take me.""
Those are the opening lines to ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" the memoir by Republican Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance. It documents his rocky childhood growing up in Jackson, Kentucky, and Middletown, Ohio.
Like Vance, I, too, learned my address for the same reasons. In fact, the geography is pretty similar. I was born in Middletown, just like Vance. But I was raised just west of there. I can’t claim Middletown residency like Vance, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune, basketball Hall of Famer Jerry Lucas, football Hall of Famer Cris Carter or baseball All-Star Kyle Schwarber. 
I didn’t graduate from Middletown High School like Vance. However, I spent a lot of time in Middletown growing up. I know Middletown about as well as any place on Earth.
JD VANCE'S HOMETOWN OF MIDDLETOWN, OHIO, WAS BUILT BY STEEL INDUSTRY: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IT

Both of my parents graduated from Middletown High School. My dad worked for four decades at ARMCO Steel, a major plant in Middletown. In ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Vance writes about how the fate of Middletown was linked to ARMCO, now known as Cleveland-Cliffs. I spent countless hours visiting my maternal grandmother who lived in Middletown. Like Vance’s family, grandparents on both sides of my family migrated from eastern Kentucky to Middletown to work at ARMCO. 
Middletown was predominant in our lives.
We went to the doctor and dentist in Middletown. We shopped in Middletown. We attended church in Middletown. In 1976, I watched President Gerald Ford roll down Verity Parkway in an open-air convertible in Middletown.
As I grew older, I bought cassette tapes of Def Leppard and Iron Maiden in Middletown. We dined regularly at Frisch’s and a hamburger stand called The Jug in Middletown. I took a few classes at the Miami University (Ohio) branch in Middletown. I played basketball and soccer in Middletown. And I ran laps at the indoor track and swam at the YMCA there, too.
I still swing through Middletown to this day. I regularly buy a small cake or a box of smiley face cookies from the Central Pastry. I have never encountered another establishment which can rival the butter cream icing of the Central Pastry.
Vance worked as a cashier at Dillman’s, a local grocery store. Roger Dillman, who owned the store, sponsored me as a delegate to attend Buckeye Boys State. It’s a nationwide government politics program operated by the American Legion. 
Starting in junior high, I studied vocal performance under the legendary Helen Ramsdell in Middletown. She taught music from her stately home on Central Avenue. In addition to yours truly, Ramsdell famously taught the McGuire Sisters back in the 1930s. Look ‘em up, kids. 
Some of my most formative experiences unfolded in Middletown during my high school years.
The local arts organization ran a program called Summer Youth Theatre in Middletown. Students as young as 12 and as old as 18 could audition for a show, usually a musical. The performances often fell around the end of July or first of August at Middletown High School. In fact, if you examine some of the video from Vance’s rally last week at the school, you can spy the raised portion of the building which still serves as the auditorium.
At the time, Middletown High School had one of the best high school theater facilities in the state, a sprawling, wooden stage. It featured built-in footlights and an apron that jutted into a chasm that doubled as the orchestra pit. The backstage was spacious. It was deep enough to carry several layers of curtains, travelers and scrims. There was a set shop and a commodious makeup room, as well as two dressing rooms for the performers. 
My high school to the southwest of Middletown had none of those things. We had a ""raised garage"" in the ""cafetorium."" So, performing at Middletown each summer was a thrill. I acted in ""Oklahoma!,"" ""South Pacific,"" ""Gypsy,"" ""Li’l Abner,"" ""Bye-Bye Birdie"" and ""George M!"" It was great fun. Plus, you got to meet and hang out with kids from other schools.
VARIETY'S FILM CRITIC WRITES 'HILLBILLY ELEGY' FILM 'MAY HAVE CREATED A MONSTER' LEGITIMIZING JD VANCE

After rehearsal each night, many of us would drive down Briel Boulevard in Middletown to find something to eat. It’s doubtful that any thoroughfare in America could boast of such a dense concentration of fast-food joints and other eateries: Burger King, Long John Silvers, Friendly’s, Famous Recipe Fried Chicken, Rax Roast Beef, McDonald’s, Wendy’s, White Castle, Pizza Hut, Captain D’s. There was an Arby’s around the corner along with a local pizza place called Cassano’s. If we were out really late, a few of us might head to Milton’s Donuts. Milton’s stayed open all night. 
As kids do, we’d talk about our aspirations, our hopes and our dreams. But for most of us, we were going to leave Middletown to make it big in theater, or music or movies. These dreams were all fueled by an ice cold Coca-Cola and a bacon double cheeseburger from Burger King. 
Even though I spent a lot of time in Middletown, I always considered my visits as ""going into town."" After all, we were from the country. 
In fact, Middletown was a place I looked up to at the time. It wasn’t Cincinnati or Dayton or New York or Chicago. But it seemed more sophisticated than the country landscape where I lived. Middletown had a vibrant arts scene. There was an art gallery and regular classical music performances. There was a ""grown-up"" theater troupe and several movie theaters. 
The houses seemed nicer in Middletown. Many of the students seemed a little better off. Their parents might have worked at ARMCO. But maybe they were employed on the corporate side of things. They weren’t blue-collar workers like my dad.
It always seemed like there was more to do in Middletown than out where we lived. 
But something was afoot in Middletown that I didn’t realize at the time.
Middletown was a ""company town"" because of ARMCO, but ARMCO began bleeding cash in the 1980s. The recession of the time hurt American steel manufacturers. The influx of foreign cars into the U.S. market exacerbated things, just like the ""dumping"" of cheaper steel into the American market from abroad. 
ARMCO slashed jobs. Kawasaki purchased ARMCO, forming a new firm named AK Steel. It temporarily shifted the headquarters from the vaunted ""Central Offices"" in Middletown to Pennsylvania. There was a brief lockout at ARMCO in 1987. There was nearly a strike in 1990.
I always parachuted into Middletown when I would come home from Washington. Sometimes, just to catch up with friends or go grab a meal. But things were evolving.
Eventually, people moved out of Middletown. They may not have moved to Washington, D.C., like me, but they left for bigger cities like Cincinnati or Columbus. AK Steel remained in business. Middletown didn’t become Youngstown or East Chicago. But the place wasn’t quite what it was decades ago. The global economy evolved, thanks to outsourcing and congressional adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
This is what makes Middletown an American story. 
I really noticed changes in Middletown after the financial crisis of 2008. The streets were ruddy and worn. A mall on the eastern side of the city near I-75 struggled. Shops were boarded up. The population dipped slightly. There were always pockets of poverty in Middletown. But – like much of the U.S. – the hardship was now more pronounced. The city looked destitute. Meth use skyrocketed. Homelessness, which one rarely saw before, was now obvious in downtown Middletown. There was even prostitution.
In the late summer of 2008, the presidential campaign of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., flew former Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin into Middletown’s Hook Field under cover of darkness. Palin was a surprise pick to be McCain’s running mate. McCain planned to roll out Palin at a rally in nearby Dayton the next day. Bringing Palin into unsuspecting Middletown helped the campaign keep its pick under wraps.
The campaign put up Palin and her family at what had been the posh Manchester Motor Inn in downtown Middletown. JFK even stayed at the Manchester when he campaigned in Ohio for President in 1960. But the Manchester was a shadow of itself. It had threadbare carpet and ancient fixtures in the bathrooms. Palin’s daughter, Bristol, ripped the Manchester’s ramshackle state in her 2011 book.

""The raggedy old hotel had dated furniture, small rooms, ugly pink walls, and an abundant supply of cockroaches,"" wrote the younger Palin. ""I’d never even seen a cockroach before. Reporters might not think Wasilla is the prettiest town in the world, but at least we don’t have roaches.""
And Bristol Palin didn’t even get the name of the town right. She dished about ""Middleton,"" not Middletown.
But like many places in America, Middletown rallied from the 2008 economic calamity. While major banks that occupied three of four corners in downtown Middletown closed, Cincinnati State opened a branch campus in the old Cincinnati, Gas & Electric building. That fueled a mini-wave of a few coffee shops and restaurants downtown. There’s even an Italian steakhouse now. They paved the streets. 
""Middletown Dreams"" is a mid-80s track by the Canadian rock band Rush. Late Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart said he chose that title ""because there is a Middletown in almost every state in the U.S. It comes from people identifying with a strong sense of neighborhood.""
One lyric goes like this:
""Dreams transport the ones / Who need to get out of town...""
One can certainly appreciate that sentiment considering the portrait of Middletown painted by Vance in ""Hillbilly Elegy.""
But Rush’s song ends with this:
""And life's not unpleasant / In their little neighborhood / They dream in Middletown.""
Middletown may be a place of nightmares to some, but it's also a place of dreams. Think of all the people from eastern Kentucky who migrated to Middletown to work at ARMCO.

They had dreams — dreams of a better life and better wages. Middletown certainly fueled my dreams. I suspect they did the same for JD Vance, too. 
And dreaming in Middletown — all of the Middletowns — is a very American story.

CNN_1,Harris coalition takes shape with ‘new energy’ from fraying Biden alliance,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/kamala-harris-coalition-michigan-democrats/index.html,2024-07-31 12:00:00,politics,"
            For Charity Dean, the weight of the presidential race is suddenly a bit heavier as she moves beyond the exhaustion of a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump to a fresh start with Vice President Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic nominee.
    

            “It’s refreshing. There’s a new energy that we didn’t have previously,” said Dean, who owns a coffee shop in northwest Detroit. “Folks that were not interested in a Biden-Trump race are definitely interested now that we have the vice president on the top of the ticket.”
    

            A week after Harris secured enough delegate support to effectively lock down the Democratic nomination, the whirlwind of excitement coursing through the party is giving way to the urgent work of building a Harris coalition – after spending a year trying to shore up Biden’s fraying one.
    

            “It’s not just we have an opportunity to make history,” said Dean, who also leads the Michigan Black Business Alliance. “It’s also, ‘Oh my gosh, what happens if we don’t?’”

Harris nears vice presidential announcement as her team tests out top contenders


            Michigan will be a critical laboratory for how the Harris campaign builds and sustains its coalition and the degree to which it will look different from Biden’s winning 2020 alliance that he struggled to keep together this year, particularly with younger voters and voters of color.
    

            Conversations with more than two dozen voters, party activists and Democratic officials in Detroit and the surrounding communities underscored a surge in interest toward Harris among women, voters of color and younger voters. It’s an open question how her support holds among independent voters and rank-and-file labor union members, particularly as Trump and Republican groups race to define her.
    

            “Instead of having something to vote against, now we have something to vote for,” said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, who sounded the alarm months ago about a lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Biden, despite the achievements of his first term.
    

            “Pre-Joe Biden’s announcement, we were stirring molasses,” Williams said in an interview outside his church this week. “Post-Joe Biden’s announcement, we’re on a rocket ship.”
    

            Just 10 days into her presidential candidacy, Harris’ campaign is still ramping up – conducting a vice presidential vetting process on a short deadline, rewriting plans for next month’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago and beefing up advertising and fundraising teams after she raised $200 million in her first week.
    

            Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, began unleashing a fresh wave of attacks on Harris on Tuesday with a $12.2 million television advertising buy across six battleground states, including Michigan. One new ad labels Harris the Biden administration’s “border czar” and highlights her role in serving as the administration’s point person in terms of addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.
    

            “This is America’s border czar – and she’s failed us,” a narrator says over video of Harris dancing at an event. The narrator describes the vice president as “Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.”

Kamala Harris has energized Democratic voters. But can she expand the map?


            Trump won Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in 2016 – cracking the Democratic “blue wall” of must-win-states. Biden won those states back four years later. And before his exit from the race, his campaign had identified the three states as his most realistic path to securing the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win this fall.
    

            Though Harris’ appeal among women, voters of color and young people could expand the map and put in play Sun Belt battlegrounds – including, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, where Harris held a rally Tuesday night – the blue wall states are certain to be a focus for both Harris and Trump.
    

            That’s not lost on ardent supporters of the vice president like Dean, who named her coffee shop Rosa after her great-grandmother, someone who she said would be thrilled by the historic nature of Harris’ candidacy.
    

            “We have a fear in our country because we’ve seen racism and we’ve seen sexism,” Dean said. “I’ve heard a lot of comments about, well, will they vote for her? I said there is no ‘they,’ it is us. And with that confidence and with that momentum, it becomes contagious.”
    

            Though Harris’ candidacy is in its early stages, and Trump’s attacks are only beginning, some Michigan Democrats say the vice president has the opportunity to shed the skepticism many felt toward Biden.
    

            In Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary in February, more than 101,000 people – 13.2% of the primary electorate – cast their votes for “uncommitted,” rather than Biden, in what was largely seen as a show of opposition to the president’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
    

            “Uncommitted” won 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden’s 40% – an outcome that served as a glaring warning sign in a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state.

Harris says she ‘will not be silent’ on Gaza suffering while telling Netanyahu to get ceasefire deal done


            Though Harris will have to tread carefully over the war in Gaza to avoid undermining Biden – and her statements, choice of running mate and more will play roles in how she is judged – she could win back some voters in communities that have largely broken with Biden.
    

            Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who supported the campaign to lodge “uncommitted” protest votes during the primary, said he sees a potential opening for Harris.
    

            “Wth Vice President Harris, you see a renewed spark,” Hammoud told CNN, “especially amongst a younger population, a more diverse coalition and an opportunity to rebuild that coalition that helped put President Biden over the top.”
    

            Asked whether he would support Harris and encourage others in his community to do the same, Hammoud said it was too early to say. He said he wanted to hear more from Harris – amplifying on her empathetic comments about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week – and wouldn’t likely reach a decision without a conversation with her or her foreign policy advisers.
    

            “It really falls down to the values and priorities. That has not changed for me,” he said. “I’m hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course.”
    

            Here in Michigan, the contours of the new race are settling in, which Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens heard first-hand as she knocked on doors in her Oakland County district north of Detroit.
    

            A blue and white sign in bold letters, “Dump Trump,” was planted in a front yard only a few houses down from one that read, “Michigan for Trump. Make America Great Again.”
    

            “I do think you’re seeing people activated in a new way,” Stevens said.

            While many residents weren’t home – or didn’t answer their doors – Stevens forged ahead until she found two cars in the driveway and the lights on inside a white, two-story house.
    

            “How are you feeling about the switch from Biden to Harris?” Stevens asked.
    

            “I feel good,” replied Reuben Maxbauer, who held his young son in his arms as he answered the door. “If the last seven days are representative of the next 100 days, it will be quite the roller coaster, but very exciting.”
    

            But Maxbauer, who has family members living in Israel, said he wanted to learn more about Harris’ positions, especially on the Middle East.
    

            “I don’t think she has a clearly enough defined position, at least that we’re aware of,” he said, “that I can say whether she makes us comfortable or not.”
    

            As she continued her walk, Stevens acknowledged that is one of the lingering challenges for Harris and Democrats in Michigan – a critical balancing act of foreign policy and domestic politics.
    

            “Where we’re standing, every vote really matters Every conversation carries a lot of weight,” Stevens said. “But I’m not going to sugarcoat. There’s also still a lot of passions and tensions and emotions around the Middle East.”
    

            But in the closing three months of the race, Stevens said, Trump may end up a unifying force – for Democrats too.
    

            “I think that’s what we’ll see happen,” she said. “I really do.”

CNN_2,"Fact check: NFL quarterbacks Burrow, Goff and Jones didn’t join fundraising call supporting Kamala Harris",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/fact-check-nfl-quarterbacks-kamala-harris-fundraising-call/index.html,2024-07-31 11:52:00,politics,"
            A series of viral posts on social media this week promoted claims that NFL quarterbacks Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals, Jared Goff of the Detroit Lions and Daniel Jones of the New York Giants had joined a public “White Dudes for Harris” online fundraising call Monday night in support of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.
    

Facts First: The viral posts are false. A source connected to Burrow, a source connected to Goff and a source connected to Jones told CNN Tuesday that each of them was not on the call. The three quarterbacks have not publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential election. 


            Posts claiming the quarterbacks were on the pro-Harris call - or that they “reportedly” or “apparently” were on the call - generated millions of views on X. The claims also made their way to some sports websites.
    

            The claims were previously debunked Tuesday by publications including Front Office Sports.
    

            The claim about Burrow in particular had been propelled by a Harris supporter account called Kamala’s Wins, which has more than 500,000 followers. The account received more than 3.5 million views on a post Monday night claiming the Bengals star is supporting Harris and was on the call.
    

            Kamala’s Wins deleted the post Tuesday. The account, which is run anonymously, did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment later in the day.

            Arizona Republican Kari Lake will win her Senate primary Tuesday, CNN projects, to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in one of this fall’s most important races in the battle for control of the chamber.
    

            The two are competing for the seat of retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.
    

            Lake, who had the endorsement of the Senate Republican campaign arm, is projected to defeat Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lamb had just over 40% of the Republican primary vote Tuesday night – a potential warning sign for Lake as she heads into the general election needing to consolidate the GOP base and reach out to independent voters. Gallego faced no opposition for the Democratic nomination Tuesday.
    

            Lake, a former local news anchor who lost the 2022 governor’s race in her first bid for political office, is a strident ally of former President Donald Trump. She is best known nationally for pushing lies about widespread election fraud – backing an audit of the 2020 presidential race and fighting in court to overturn her 2022 loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs.
    

            Gallego, a retired Marine who represents a deep-blue Phoenix-area seat, launched his campaign in early 2023, long before Sinema announced her retirement. Sinema was elected to the seat in 2018 as a Democrat – the first from the party to win a Senate contest in Arizona in 30 years.
    

            This year’s Senate race, like many others across the political map, has been shaken up by President Joe Biden’s late decision to forgo reelection and Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have focused their attacks on Harris over her handling of border security – an issue especially important in Arizona. However, polls have shown Harris with stronger appeal than Biden among young and non-White voters, which could help Gallego in the fast-growing Sun Belt state.
    

            Many GOP donors and strategists have expressed doubts over Lake’s chances of winning this fall, citing her feuds with fellow Republicans, including the family of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and her refusal to accept past election results. A recent Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov poll found Gallego leading Lake 48% to 41% among registered Arizona voters. But if Trump does well enough in Arizona, he might be able to carry Lake to victory with him.
    

            Gallego, a onetime member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has sought to define himself as a moderate through his early television ads, touting his military service and efforts to lower costs for families.
    

            Gallego enters the general election with a financial edge over Lake. He reported $8.2 million in his campaign coffers on July 10 compared with his opponent’s $2.1 million.

CNN_4,Texas gets win from full appeals court in dispute with DOJ over buoys in Rio Grande,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/texas-rio-grande-buoys-5th-circuit-decision/index.html,2024-07-31 10:24:00,politics,"
            The full 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals handed Texas a major win Tuesday in its ongoing legal dispute with the Biden administration over the state’s construction of a floating barrier in the Rio Grande.
    

In a split ruling, the very conservative appeals court wiped away a judge’s preliminary ruling – put on pause in January by the full 5th Circuit – that had directed Texas to remove the barriers.
    

            Circuit Judge Don Willett, writing for the majority of the New Orleans-based court, said the relevant federal law likely did not apply to the stretch of the river where Texas had placed the buoys. He also concluded that the Justice Department had “offered no evidence that the barrier threatens safety,” and rejected the department’s arguments that the lower court order was necessary to alleviate diplomatic tensions with Mexico.
    

            Seven judges signed on to dissents. Circuit Judge James Ho, known for his especially strident opinions, wrote a partial dissent that said Texas should prevail for a different reason: Its move to erect the buoys is a “strategic military decision” by the state to “repel” a foreign “invasion,” making the case a political dispute that courts lack the authority to weigh in on.
    

            It is not clear if the Justice Department – which did not seek the Supreme Court’s intervention when the 5th Circuit allowed Texas to keep the barriers in place earlier this year – will now appeal the new ruling to the high court. Spokespeople for the department did not respond to CNN’s inquiry.
    

            Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott celebrated the ruling on X with a post, saying, “Texas can KEEP these buoys in the water securing our border.”
    

            “Biden tried to remove them. I fought to keep them in the water. That is exactly where they will stay. JUSTICE!!!!” Abbott said.
    

            The proceedings will continue in the case as it heads to a full trial.
    

            The Justice Department sued Texas over the barriers in July 2023 and obtained the judge’s order directing their removal in September. After a 5th Circuit panel upheld that order, the full appeals court voted to rehear the case.

CNN_5,Harris nears vice presidential announcement as her team tests out top contenders,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-vice-presidential-selection/index.html,2024-07-31 10:15:00,politics,"
            (CNN) — Kamala Harris is in the thick of choosing a vice presidential running mate, with her campaign eying an announcement in the coming days that would be immediately followed by a joint tour of a series of battleground states beginning next Tuesday.
    

            Harris, abruptly thrust into the role of presidential candidate fewer than 10 days ago, has been studying notebooks filled with information about each of the top vice presidential contenders, has had preliminary conversations with some of those candidates, and has been asking close advisers involved in the process who would make the strongest governing partner for her at the White House, sources familiar with the process said.
    

            Harris has not yet conducted formal interviews with the top contenders, one source familiar told CNN. That process is expected to begin this week.

What this election proves about the importance of running mates and vice presidents


            Meanwhile, her team – working on an extraordinarily condensed timeline in the aftermath of President Joe Biden abruptly abandoning his reelection campaign just a little over three months out from Election Day – has been swiftly researching and testing out the top candidates, including by studying videos of those being vetted.
    

            The top contenders include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has taken himself out of the running and declined the campaign’s request to be vetted, CNN reported Monday. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear are also still in conversation, but people close to the process believe they are not top contenders.
    

            The vice president’s choice will be revealed by Tuesday, when she and her running mate will kick off the battleground state blitz beginning with their first joint rally in Philadelphia, according to a campaign official. The pair will then travel to western Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.
    

            Eric Holder, the former attorney general, is leading a vetting team of a few dozen Democratic lawyers who are poring over financial records and family histories of the contenders. Tony West, a former associate attorney general and Harris’ brother-in-law, is also playing a leading advisory role in the search process.
    

            As is typical in vice presidential searches, the Harris campaign has been intently focused on who could help strengthen the Harris ticket’s electoral chances. Polling has been conducted of how at least some candidates, particularly Shapiro and Kelly, could influence the race in battleground states.
    

            The Harris campaign declined to comment for this story.
    

            “She, better than anyone aside from a couple other people on earth, knows what the job of VP entails, for better and for worse,” a longtime Harris friend said. The vice president is looking for a partner who could “do the job that she currently holds, do it in a way that is additive and not distracting, and ideally helps shore up any weaknesses she has electorally right now because governing doesn’t matter if you don’t win,” the friend added.
    

            In a memo at the outset of her candidacy, the Harris campaign argued it saw “multiple” pathways to 270 electoral votes across the so-called Blue Wall states, which include Shapiro’s Pennsylvania, and the Sun Belt, which includes Kelly’s Arizona.
    

            But internally, campaign strategists have acknowledged that Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes could be make-or-break for the outcome.
    

            “Pennsylvania is the tipping point,” one strategist close to the campaign told CNN. “Once you acknowledge that, it becomes pretty obvious who [Harris] should pick.”
    

            On policy, selecting Shapiro, who is Jewish, is seen by some advisers as providing political cover for Harris on the Middle East, where she has spoken out more forcefully in recent days against the humanitarian suffering in Gaza than Biden, even as the two have pursued the same policy of assisting Israel in its military defense.
    

            But as Shapiro has emerged as a top candidate for her running mate, the team is also examining his potential weak spots – including the resignation last year of Shapiro’s close top aide, Mike Vereb, amid a sexual harassment investigation. The governor’s administration paid nearly $300,000 to settle the claims, but Shapiro has not been implicated.
    

            “Although the Commonwealth does not comment on specific personnel matters, it takes allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously,” Manuel Bonder, spokesperson for Shapiro’s office, said in a statement, noting that “robust procedures are in place for thoroughly investigating reports of discrimination and harassment.”
    

            While some Democrats have urged the campaign to reveal the running mate at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which opens August 19, Harris has expressed a desire to have a partner sooner. With about three months remaining in the race, advisers say, a vice presidential candidate is needed on the campaign trail as soon as Harris makes her decision.

CNN_6,Garland on special counsel appointment ruling: ‘Do I look like someone who would make that basic mistake about the law?’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/garland-cannon-nbc-news-interview-mistake/index.html,2024-07-31 09:26:00,politics,"
            Attorney General Merrick Garland stressed his unhappiness with the Florida-based judge who said his appointment of a special counsel to prosecute Donald Trump was illegal, saying he wouldn’t make a “basic mistake about the law.”
    

In an interview with NBC News, Garland was asked about Judge Aileen Cannon’s ruling this month that threw out the indictment charging the former president with mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.
    

            The attorney general, a former federal judge and a Supreme Court nominee blocked by the Senate, didn’t hold back as he spoke from a Justice Department library.

If the Trump classified documents case is reinstated, Judge Aileen Cannon would be difficult to remove


            “Look as you well know, I picked this room for this interview,” Garland said in response to a question about Cannon’s ruling. “This is my favorite room in the Justice Department. It’s a law library. For more than 20 years I was a federal judge. Do I look like somebody who would make that basic mistake about the law? I don’t think so.”
    

            Garland added: “Our position is that it’s constitutional and valid. That’s why we appealed.”
    

            The Justice Department is appealing the ruling to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in hopes of allowing special counsel Jack Smith to resume his case in Florida. It’s unclear if Cannon’s ruling will impact the charges against Trump related to January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC.
    

            Garland said he followed the same process in appointing Smith as was previously done when John Durham and Robert Mueller were appointed as special counsels during the Trump administration.
    

            “’Til now, every single court, including the Supreme Court, that has considered the legality of special counsel appointment has upheld it,” Garland said.
    

            Garland also warned in the interview published Tuesday of threats against US government officials from Iran, saying, “I don’t think we’ve seen the end of Iranian plotting.”
    

            He told NBC that “our intelligence community has made clear that we believe that the Iranians are attempting to kill or injure former high government officials.”
    

            “This is an ongoing issue,” he said. “We have ongoing investigations.”
    

            The attorney general also﻿ said it was “extremely alarming” that a would-be assassin was able to get so close to Trump.
    

            “Democracy will not survive if people decide that the way in which they’re going to get whatever outcomes they want, or whatever other motive he may have, is by killing someone,” he said. “That’s why we have to find out what happened here, why it happened and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

CNN_7,Kamala Harris has energized Democratic voters. But can she expand the map?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally/index.html,2024-07-31 08:56:00,politics,"
            During the first whirlwind week of her second presidential campaign, Kamala Harris locked up the support of the Democratic Party, recruited thousands of volunteers and hauled in $200 million in donations.
    

            But the challenge over the next 98 days will be whether she can harness that energy to power electoral victories in both traditional party strongholds and the newer battlegrounds that had appeared to be slipping away under President Joe Biden.
    

            The latest test of Harris’ appeal took place Tuesday in Georgia, where she held a rally in Atlanta with nearly 10,000 attendees, according to her campaign. The vice president was joined by Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, two-time Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and rappers Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo.
    

            “I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right though this state,” Harris told the crowd.
    

            That Harris would make a high-profile visit to Georgia early in her White House bid indicates the renewed push the campaign is making in a state that’s now back in play for Democrats.
    

            Any Democratic path to victory almost certainly runs through the so-called “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where polls showed a tied race between former President Donald Trump and his then-Democratic opponent, Biden, for months. But, with Harris now the party’s presumptive nominee, keeping Sun Belt states like Georgia – as well as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina – competitive could give Democrats much needed breathing room.
    

            Democrats became disillusioned months ago with the prospect of winning in Georgia, according to party strategists involved in conversations. Frustrations over inflation and the suffering in Gaza were mounting among voters, whose turnout was becoming increasingly uncertain. A mid-May commencement address by Biden at Morehouse College was marked by drama around the possibility of protests over his handling of the war in Gaza.
    

            Following the presidential debate in Atlanta in late June, Biden flew directly to North Carolina to rally voters there, a decision that sources involved suggested was rooted in the greater likelihood at that point of flipping the Tar Heel State – with its heavily college-educated, suburban voter base and growing minority population – than keeping Georgia, which he won in 2020 with a narrow majority, this year.
    

            Now, Georgia again is seen as within the party’s grasp – with a senior Democratic strategist describing Harris’s candidacy as a “defibrillator,” jolting voters back into awareness. For young people and voters of color, the strategist said, that jolt was more noticeable, and producing an expectation that Harris could engender more support among the African Americans who comprise roughly a third of Georgia’s population.
    

            But the opportunity in the state, whose former Republican lieutenant governor says is “absolutely” back in play, could extend well beyond those coalitions.
    

            “Any electoral advantage Donald Trump had has been erased,” Geoff Duncan told CNN. “The suburbs of Atlanta are back up for grabs.”
    

            In a new campaign memo shared with CNN Monday evening, Harris’ Georgia state director Porsha White outlined what the campaign hopes is a winning strategy in the state.
    

            “We turned Georgia blue for the first time in three decades in 2020, and we’re feeling the energy we need to win the state again in 2024,” White wrote. “Tomorrow, Vice President Harris’ visit will highlight her brighter vision for the future, where our freedoms are protected and every American has a fair shot. And we’re going to make the choice clear to every voter across our state.”
    

            Per the campaign, more than 7,500 volunteers have signed up in the week since Harris moved to the top of the ticket, with more than 1,000 signed up on the day after Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race. The campaign has 24 coordinated offices and 170 Democratic coordinated campaign staff across the state.
    

            Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams, who is also the chair of the state Democratic Party, told CNN her Georgia Democrats gained 1,000 volunteers and saw a more than 300% uptick in donations in the last week.
    

            “The last eight days have been a whole vibe in battleground Georgia,” Williams, who will appear at the Atlanta rally, told CNN. “We are seeing people energized and volunteering in ways that we have not seen in the past.”
    

            Early polls have shown Harris outperforming Biden against Trump with key groups within the Democratic coalition and erasing much of the popular vote lead Trump held over Biden.
    

            A Siena/New York Times poll released last week found that, in a head-to-head match up against Trump with likely voters, Hispanic voters favored Harris over the former president by a 24-point margin and voters ages 18-29 favored her by a 21-point margin. In an earlier poll released July 2, Biden held only 3- and 1-point leads with those groups, respectively, against Trump, within the margin of error.
    

            During Georgia’s 2020 election, the Biden-Harris ticket won 88% of Black voters, 62% of Latinos, 54% of women and a majority of voters ages 18-49, according to CNN exit polls. To win the state again, Harris will need a broad coalition of support from younger voters, suburban women and people of color. This will require shoring up parts of the coalition that frayed during the president’s time in office, particularly Black men.
    

            In interviews, men who attended Monday night’s gathering of the Black Man Lab – an organization that holds events for Black men to build community – in Atlanta shared mixed views on what they wanted to see from Harris. Some called on the vice president to articulate a message specifically aimed at Black men, while others pointed to the enthusiasm around her run and condemned efforts from Republicans to paint her as a DEI candidate despite her record.
    

            One participant, Mario Reyes, rejected the narrative that Black men wouldn’t vote for Harris in November.
    

            “One thing I’ve noticed for years is that Black women show up for us all the time,” Reyes said. “This is the time in which Black men are going to show up for her in big numbers, in a way that they’ve never seen before in America.”
    

            Henry Caslin, who also attended, was also skeptical of the notion of Black men drifting toward Trump, calling it a “myth.” But he said he wanted to see Harris make a unique pitch to him.
    

            “I want to hear a message for me that’s not talking to me through the language of social justice,” he said. “I would like for her to speak more to Black men.”
    

            For Democratic organizers, winning in Georgia isn’t just about keeping the White House, but maintaining hard won gains in a state that has been promising to tilt blue for years.
    

            Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia, when he beat former Trump by just under 12,000 votes, marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state in nearly 30 years. Weeks later, voters sent two Democratic senators – Ossoff and Warnock – to Washington.
    

            Jay Williams, a Georgia-based Republican strategist, argued that those races were unique. “At the end of the day, Georgia still is a right-leaning state,” he said. “It’s not wildly right, but it is a right-leaning state.”
    

            Despite the gains in late 2020 and early 2021, Abrams, Democrats’ gubernatorial pick, was unable to win in a 2022 rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.
    

            Democrats are hoping for a different outcome this November. Hillary Holley, who leads Care in Action, a group that advocates for domestic workers, said she believed the Democratic base was consolidating around Harris.
    

            “Georgia was looking for something refreshing, something new that we could bring to voters and a sense of renewed hope,” she said. “And I think that’s what we are now seeing.”
    

            LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said Harris has invested a lot of time in the state, which could help her now that she’s the presumptive nominee. But the vice president may also benefit from the work grassroots groups in the state have done to help make the state more competitive, Brown said.
    

            “I think we’re breaking up this red wall that many of us feel has created an agenda and policies that have been hurtful and harmful,” Brown said. “We have been working diligently over the last decade to actually build a real movement infrastructure.”

CNN_8,"Harris goes on offensive on immigration, comparing her record with Trump’s",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/harris-immigration-trump/index.html,2024-07-31 08:34:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris went on the offensive on immigration at her rally in Atlanta Tuesday, attempting to counter former President Donald Trump’s attacks on the issue.
    

            She touted her role as a California attorney general who prosecuted transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers, then blamed Trump for “tanking” this year’s bipartisan border bill on Capitol Hill “because he thought it would help him win an election.”
    

            “Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself,” Harris said, adding that she would work to pass the bill as president.
    

            “In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day,” she said in a high-profile visit to Georgia that comes early in her bid and signals the campaign’s renewed push to put the state in play for Democrats. She also called on Trump to debate her, drawing loud cheers from the crowd when she said, “Because as the saying goes, if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.”
    

            The Harris campaign earlier Tuesday previewed how it will be responding to Trump’s attacks falsely casting her as the administration’s “border czar” with a new 50-second campaign video. It paints Trump as unserious on border security and cites his decision to scuttle the bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory.
    

            “Kamala Harris supports increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. Donald Trump blocked a bill to increase the number of Border Patrol agents,” the voiceover in the video states, similarly citing Harris’ support for investing in new technology to block fentanyl from entering the US.
    

            “Kamala Harris prosecuted transnational gang members and got them sentenced to prison. Trump is trying to avoid being sentenced to prison,” it continues, concluding with: “There’s two choices in this election: The one who will fix our broken immigration system and the one who is trying to stop her.”
    

            The video will be shared on social media, though it’s unclear whether the campaign will put money behind it and blast it on airwaves. It doesn’t make mention of the Republican label “border czar.”
    

            The management of the US-Mexico border had been a political liability for President Joe Biden, and it is now following Harris as Trump seizes on her task to address the root causes of migration in Central America.

Ad wars heat up between Trump and Harris


            The video comes on the heels of two Trump campaign ads taking direct aim at Harris’ immigration portfolio.
    

            Both Trump campaign ads, released this week, pull from a 2021 NBC interview where Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn’t yet visited the US-Mexico border and she stumbled through a response by claiming she also hadn’t yet gone to Europe — an answer that perplexed administration officials at the time.
    

            While another shows a video of Harris dancing at an event, stating: “This is America’s border czar — and she’s failed us.”
    

            Both ads conclude by describing Harris as “failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.”
    

            Harris’ root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, but in the last three years, her assignment has been bundled with the administration’s larger migration issues.
    

            Biden administration officials have repeatedly maintained that Harris focused on long-term fixes, while the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.

CNN_9,Arson-sparked Park Fire is now California’s fifth-largest wildfire,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/park-fire-arson-arraignment-wildfires/index.html,2024-07-31 13:10:00,us,"
California’s Park Fire is now the fifth-largest wildfire in the state’s history, and a man accused of starting the destructive flames appeared in court Monday. At the same time, dozens of other fires continue to rage in the Western United States and Canada and thousands have been forced to evacuate. Here’s the latest:


            • Park Fire climbs California’s record books: The fire, which began July 24, is now the fifth-largest wildfire in California history, having burned more than 386,000 acres, or 603 square miles, according to Cal Fire. “This region, both Butte and Tehama, over the course of time in California, has had four of the largest 10 fires known in history,” Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See told a news conference Monday. As of Tuesday evening, it was 18% contained and had destroyed at least 192 structures and damaged 19 others across two of the affected counties. Cal Fire officials said more than 5,500 firefighters, including aerial and ground crews, had been working to quell the flames.
    

            • Man accused of igniting California’s Park Fire charged: Ronnie Dean Stout II has been charged with arson on suspicion of starting the Park Fire last week, a felony complaint filed Monday shows. A court document – similar to what authorities previously said – alleges in part that a witness saw him pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment. Stout is claiming he did not push the car, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said at a news conference. Stout didn’t enter a plea during a court appearance Monday, but he was denied bail, and his arraignment was continued to Thursday, Ramsey said. More charges could be added, he said.

            • California resident once again loses home to fire: Standing in the charred remains of his house, Butte County resident Rick Pero told CNN affiliate KHSL the Park Fire was the second California wildfire to destroy his home. Pero and his wife moved to Forest Ranch after losing another property to 2018’s deadly Camp Fire. This time, Pero and his wife were away when they got an evacuation warning and told their house sitter to pack the car and leave, he told KHSL. “We said don’t wait for the order stage, go ahead and load up. And, unfortunately, he wasn’t able to get our shy cat out because it hides from people, so he got our other cat and loaded the car and was able to easily and successfully evacuate,” Pero said. He and his wife could still remain in Butte County, he said, but were also looking further afield. “It’s after two times, you know, live and learn,” he told KHSL. “This one was a harder one because of losing our little cat.”
    

            • Active wildfires in the US: Firefighters are dealing with 89 large active wildfires in the United States as of Tuesday– most of which were in the West, including 31 in Oregon and 10 in California and Idaho, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Together, the active fires cover more than 2 million acres.
    

            The agency stressed the need to have firefighters and firefighting resources available in areas where there was a high likelihood of fire breaking out due to the importance of an “initial attack” on new fires. “The vast majority of fire starts are contained at small sizes within 24 hours of their discovery,” it said.
    

            As the blazes continue, gusty winds could bring more fire concerns and the heat is expected to build across the West throughout this week, becoming more substantial by Friday and lingering into next week. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, and daily high temperature records could be tied or broken, especially across the Pacific Northwest, over the weekend.
    

            These fires have generated smoke that has drifted hundreds of miles and prompted air quality alerts across parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. More alerts could be issued Tuesday.
    

            • Alberta’s Jasper Wildfire Complex remains ‘out of control’: In Canada, the Jasper Wildfire Complex is still burning in the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies. The Jasper National Park remained closed to the public and under an evacuation warning, officials in Alberta said Monday afternoon. Around 17,000 people have evacuated, officials noted. “While the wildfire remains classified as out of control, no significant growth has been reported as of this morning,” the municipality of Jasper said Monday afternoon, noting it is trying to plan bus tours for evacuated residents to see the damage once the area is deemed safe. The Jasper Wildfire Complex has scorched nearly 80,000 acres, Alberta Wildfire said.
    

            • Temperatures to rise this week amid Oregon wildfire: Oregon’s largest wildfire, the Durkee Fire, was 51% contained Tuesday morning after scorching more than 293,000 acres, according to InciWeb. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line due to lightning, InciWeb states. Scattered showers from a cold front moved through the region Monday into early Tuesday, but no rainfall is expected the rest of the week and temperatures are expected to rise to triple digits by the weekend, which could impair firefighting efforts.
    

            • Evacuations ordered in Colorado: Thousands of evacuation orders have been issued after a wildfire broke out on Alexander Mountain near Loveland, Colorado, Monday, according to the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office. Smoke was reported west of Silverdale Ranch in the late morning and responders discovered a wildfire they have been fighting since, officials said at a news conference. Mandatory evacuation notices were sent to 2,635 devices registered to receive alerts in the area and voluntary notices were sent to another 1,491 devices. The sheriff’s office said it was unclear how many people the notices impacted and deputies were also going door-to-door to notify residents. As of Tuesday afternoon, the fire has burned through 1820 acres and is 0% contained, according to Inciweb.
    

            Stout, the suspect in California’s Park Fire, has been charged with arson of an inhabited structure or property, with the aggravating factors of multiple structures burning and an allegation Stout violated California’s three-strikes felony law, the complaint says. In California, each conviction for a violent or serious felony is counted as a “strike,” and people receive significantly longer prison sentences if convicted of a third felony.
    

            In a news conference Monday, Ramsey, the Butte County district attorney, detailed what he said were some of the events of July 24, the day the Park Fire began.
    

            That afternoon, Stout pulled his car over on the side of a dirt road and his vehicle got stuck in tall grass, Ramsey said. When Stout revved his engine to try to get out, a fire started, he said.
    

            A witness saw Stout next to the fire coming out of the front of his car, but said he did not try and stop it, according to a statement of facts arguing against bail for Stout. The witness saw Stout get in and out of the car, and then said he pushed the burning car down a 60-foot embankment, where the fire exploded, the statement of facts says.
    

            Stout is “admitting up to a point, but is saying he did not push his car,” Ramsey said.
    

            Shortly before the incident, Stout was seen drinking at a nearby swimming hole and witnesses said he “seemed to be highly intoxicated,” Ramsey said. Another witness said they saw him driving “extraordinarily recklessly” from the direction of the swimming hole to where the fire started, he continued.
    

            “This didn’t have to happen,” Ramsey said.
    

            When Stout was arrested early the next morning, almost 11 hours after the fire started, alcohol was found in his system above the legal limit, Ramsey said, but noted investigators had no evidence proving he was intoxicated at the time of the fire.
    

            CNN reached out to Stout’s attorney, Nicole Diamond, for comment on the allegation he was drunk at the time of the incident and to ask about Ramsey’s statement that he has partially admitted responsibility. She declined to comment.
    

            Triple-digit temperatures and high wind gusts have fueled the explosive growth of the Park Fire amid an active fire season in California. A staggering 751,327 acres have burned across the state so far in 2024, which is 29 times the amount of acres burnt in the state (25,763 acres) through the same portion of 2023, Cal Fire said.
    

            Wildfires burned more than 324,900 acres in California in all of 2023, Cal Fire said.
    

            “The numbers are a stark reminder: 95% of wildfires are caused by humans,” Cal Fire said.

CNN_10,Police search for suspect and motive after man killed in Philadelphia mosque parking lot while walking to prayer service,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/philadelphia-mosque-parking-lot-shooting/index.html,2024-07-31 12:19:00,us,"
            Authorities are searching for a suspect who they say fatally shot a 43-year-old man in an “execution-type homicide” in the parking lot of a Philadelphia mosque as he was walking to a prayer service Tuesday.
    

            Investigators believe the victim was the “intended target” of the shooting, but a motive wasn’t immediately clear, city police Chief Inspector Scott Small said. Police have been speaking with at least one witness to the shooting, he said.
    

            Philadelphia police responded to several 911 calls reporting gunshots just before 5 p.m., Small said. Officers found the victim unresponsive in the parking lot of Al-Aqsa Islamic Society with gunshot wounds, including at least one to his head and more than one to his torso, Small said.
    

            “The scene is in a parking lot of a mosque, a place of worship,” Small said.
    

            The man was pronounced dead at Temple University Hospital at 5:13 p.m., police said in a release.
    

            The suspect, described as a male wearing dark-colored clothes, was seen fleeing on fled foot and getting into a dark-colored sedan, Small said.
    

            The incident was captured on numerous private surveillance cameras, according to police, with at least one camera capturing the entire incident, the chief inspector said.
    

            In one video, the victim is seen walking with another male to the mosque for prayer service, Small said.
    

            “You see the shooter run up behind the victim and from just a few feet away, begin firing shots,” Small said. “It’s all caught on camera.”
    

            After the victim collapses on the sidewalk, the shooter can be seen standing over him from a few feet away, continuing to fire shots, according to Small.
    

            “So clearly, an execution-type homicide,” Small said. He noted the other person who was walking with the victim was not shot.
    

            At least 17 shots were fired from a large caliber semi-automatic weapon, Small said. No weapons have been recovered, according to police.
    

            “I counted nine very loud rapid thuds one after the other. It made me hang up, go outside, and see what’s going on,” witness Ori Beckerman told CNN affiliate WPVI.
    

            Ashraf Abdelrazek told CNN affiliate KYW that he was inside the mosque when the shooting happened. Abdulrazek ran to the management office to ask someone to call 911 after a mosque employee alerted him about the shooting, he said.
    

            “Maybe I’ll be the one instead of him, when I came to pray, maybe I’ll lose my life like him like that,” Abdelrazek said. “I just see like someone lose his life in one second.”
    

            Authorities are urging the public to contact them with any tips about the incident and are offering a $20,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.
    

            “Violence outside of a house of worship is deeply painful and traumatizing for those simply showing up to worship and practice their faith,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement on X Tuesday. “As an investigation into this killing proceeds, I’m praying for Philadelphia’s Al-Aqsa Islamic Society community, a place I’ve been several times, and hoping they find peace in each other and in their faith.”
    

            US Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said his office is “tracking the shooting.”
    

            “Everyone should be able to practice their faith in a safe environment. I have reached out to local law enforcement to offer support and hope they can investigate this tragic death quickly,” Casey posted on social media.


            State Rep. Chris Rabb, who represents part of Philadelphia County, also extended his “deepest condolences” on the mosque’s Facebook page.

CNN_11,"Missouri man is free from prison after a judge overturned his 1991 conviction, despite AG’s efforts",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/christopher-dunn-released-missouri-prison/index.html,2024-07-31 10:19:00,us,"
            A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general’s efforts to keep him there.
    

            “I never gave up because my family never gave up,” Christopher Dunn said from the steps of the downtown St. Louis courthouse. “It’s easy to give up in prison when you lose hope. But when the system throws you away, you have to ask yourself if you wanted to just settle for it or fight for it.”
    

            Dunn, 52, reunited with his wife, Kira Dunn, as he was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night. As his release drew imminent, he was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles away.
    

            A St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn’s murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.
    

            When asked about the delay since the judge’s ruling, Dunn said, “It was testing. To hear the decision by the judge and then be prepared to leave on Wednesday, only to be brought back to prison. It was torture.”
    

            Dunn’s release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey’s appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.
    

            Sandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder in which a judge deemed there was evidence of her “actual innocence.” Bailey’s office also opposed Hemme’s release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn’t freed.
    

            Political scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the August 6 primary.
    

            At one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn’t released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom.
    

            Then on Tuesday, the state’s highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn’s freedom.
    

            A statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn “is coming home.”
    

            “We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,” the statement read. “We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.”
    

            Earlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey’s effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey “superseded his jurisdiction and authority” in appealing Sengheiser’s ruling.
    

            “What’s happening now is another form of lynching,” said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People’s Organization.
    

            Bailey’s office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.
    

            “Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn’s murder conviction,” the statement read. “We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.”
    

            Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May.
    

            Sengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore “made a clear and convincing showing of ‘actual innocence’ that undermines the basis for Dunn’s convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.”
    

            The Missouri attorney general’s office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn’s conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.
    

            Rogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.
    

            In a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.
    

            Stepp’s story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a “completely unreliable witness” and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.
    

            Dunn has said he was at his mother’s home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother’s house.
    

            Tristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn’s story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.
    

            A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey’s office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.
    

            The 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.
    

            Another hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.
    

            St. Louis County’s prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn’t commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else — but not Williams — was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.
    

            A hearing on Williams’ innocence claim begins August 21. His execution is scheduled for September 24.
    

            Bailey’s office is opposing the challenge to Williams’ conviction, too.

CNN_12,"‘We failed Sonya,’ Illinois sheriff says about fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/sonya-massey-shooting-community-meeting-sheriff/index.html,2024-07-31 09:56:00,us,"
            Nearly two weeks after one of his former deputies was charged with murder in the death of a Black woman who’d called 911 for help, an Illinois sheriff on Monday publicly acknowledged his office failed the slain Springfield-area resident.
    

            “(Sonya Massey) called for help and we failed,” Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell told a community meeting at a church in Springfield about the July 6 shooting.
    

            “We did not do our jobs. We failed Sonya. We failed Sonya’s family and friends. We failed the community,” Campbell said.
    

            Massey, 36, called 911 to report a possible “prowler” at her home near Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. After two deputies went to the home to investigate, one of them, then-deputy Sean Grayson, shot and killed her following a dispute involving a pot of hot water, authorities said.
    

            Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury July 17 on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records.
    

            A review of an Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting “does not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,” the state’s attorney for the county, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release.

            At Monday night’s meeting, Campbell asked for the community’s forgiveness and expressed his willingness to enforce change within the sheriff’s office.
    

            “I stand here today before you, with arms wide open, and I ask for your forgiveness. I ask Ms. Massey and her family for forgiveness. I offer up no excuses. What I do is offer our attempt to do better. To be better,” he said.
    

            The sheriff’s office has commented on the incident previously, including on the day the office announced Grayson had been fired. The office said then that Grayson’s actions “do not reflect the values and training of the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office or law enforcement as a whole,” and it was “clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.”
    

            Monday night’s meeting was facilitated by the US Justice Department’s community relations service, which is charged with responding to and preventing community tensions and hate crimes on the basis of race and sexual orientation, among other factors.
    

            On Tuesday, civil rights attorney Ben Crump and the Rev. Al Sharpton held a news conference with Massey’s family, including her two children, her parents, uncles and aunts, cousins and friends.
    

            Sharpton referenced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which he helped draft, at the news conference, saying “it dealt with a law enforcement officer being able to go from district to district getting new job assignments. This officer worked in six different jurisdictions inside of four years. Six, which would have been illegal under the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.”
    

            Massey’s killing has thrust the act back in the national spotlight, with renewed calls for passage of the failed legislation targeting racial bias and use of force, CNN previously reported.


            “We want to see the officer prosecuted, but we also want to see the laws change,” Sharpton added. He called for Illinois to create a law in Massey’s name that would prevent  officers from repeatedly switching precincts. “A bad cop is a bad cop,” he said.
    

            Sharpton then pointed at Massey’s son, 17-year-old Malachi Hill Massey and daughter, 15-year-old Jeanette Summer Massey, saying: “This young lady and this young man will have to grow up long after these cameras are gone, long after people are gone.”
    

            The community will be starting a fund to raise money for the children, Sharpton said.
    

            Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson. In a news conference last week, attorney Crump connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US.
    

            Last week, the Justice Department said it was “assessing the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting.
    

            “We are here to bring parties together to seek mutual understanding, to problem-solve in a way that empowers those local voices, those local ideas,” Justin Lock, the service’s chief, said during the session, in which members of the community were encouraged to express their thoughts and feelings surrounding Massey’s death.
    

            Milhiser, the state’s attorney, also was among the speakers at the listening session.
    

            “My No. 1 goal as state’s attorney is to keep our community safe, prioritize community public safety,” Milhiser said. “And we do that by prosecuting cases in Sangamon County without fear or favor and holding accountable those who break the law.”
    

            At Tuesday’s news conference, Massey’s uncle – Raymond Massey – said his niece was utterly devoted to her children, her faith and her accomplishments. “To hear them say they’re having nightmares and not being able to sleep just breaks my heart,” he said.
    

            Her son, Malachi, then followed: “My mother – she means everything to me. I love her with my whole heart.”
    

            Video released last week by Illinois State Police includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County sheriff’s deputies who responded to Massey’s house after midnight on July 6.
    

            In the footage, Grayson and another deputy speak calmly with Massey in her home when she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, “away from your hot steaming water,” he says.

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she says in response.
    

            “Huh?” the deputy says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she repeats.
    

            “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says.
    

            He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, “I’m sorry” while lifting the pot, the video shows.
    

            “Drop the f**king pot!” both deputies yell.
    

            Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says “shots fired” and calls for emergency medical services.
    

            “Dude, I’m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,” Grayson says.
    

            Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. “She had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,” he says in the video. “She said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.”
    

            Massey’s autopsy report, which was released last week, said she was killed by a gunshot wound to her head.
    

            Her family’s attorney emphasized the angle at which the deputy shot Massey.
    

            Massey “was shot beneath her eye, and the bullet (exited) at the back of her neck, under her ear,” Crump told CNN. “What it tells us is that he shot her in a downward trajectory.”
    

            When asked for comment Friday, Grayson’s attorney Daniel Fultz told CNN: “I don’t wish to comment.”
    

            Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state.

            According to footage from the other deputy’s body camera, the incident began with the deputies walking around Massey’s yard and finding a vehicle with broken windows. They then knock on the door and speak with her, and she struggles to understand and answer some questions about the vehicle and about herself.
    

            As they speak in her living room, the deputies note the pot on the lit stove and one says, “we don’t need a fire while we’re here.” Massey gets up and turns off the stove and the shooting then follows.
    

            Immediately after the shooting, the video records Grayson telling his partner Massey would not need medical help.
    

            The other deputy says he’s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.”
    

            Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there’s anything he can do, but is told no.
    

            “All right, I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,” Grayson says.
    

            Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. “Yeah I’m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,” he says, according to the footage.

CNN_13,"San Francisco will enforce penalties to clear homeless encampments as advocates criticize lack of resources, shelter space",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/san-francisco-homeless-encampments-penalties/index.html,2024-07-31 09:54:00,us,"
            The city of San Francisco is set to begin enforcing penalties to clear homeless encampments throughout the city following a recent US Supreme Court decision that upheld an Oregon city’s homeless policy, and also prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to direct state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments last week.
    

            Mayor London Breed will proceed with her administration’s plans to implement “progressive penalties,” or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release – a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.
    

            “Warnings will be followed by citations,” the release said. “In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.”
    

            Newsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation’s largest homeless population, ordered state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property in a directive last Thursday. Newsom also encouraged local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state’s.
    

            The Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.

            “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part,” Newsom said, directing state agencies to “adopt humane and dignified policies” and “move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.”
    

            Homeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown – without providing adequate shelter and other services – would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.
    

            “Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,” said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of “criminalizing poverty” and “doubling down on failed policies.”
    

            The 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco’s “progressive penalties” plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor’s office said the court has “officially modified” the injunction against the city “to be in line” with the US Supreme Court ruling.
    

            In laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by “offering shelter and services to those on the street.” The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to “address smaller encampments on a daily basis” to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.
    

            California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

Newsom’s order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt “policies and plans consistent” with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.
    

            The department provides “advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site” for at least 60 days, Newsom’s office said.


            San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, is running for re-election and tackling homelessness has become a key issue. A shelter waiting list, operated by the city’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, showed 138 people were in line for shelter Tuesday evening.
    

            The city government’s most recent count showed 4,354 homeless people were unsheltered in San Francisco on a night in January.
    

            Breed’s office said “a majority of the times” city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.
    

            Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state’s homeless population.
    

            While some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn’t a place to house them.

            “It’s very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that’s been tossed around for years,” Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have “nowhere to go.”
    

            “What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately – immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,” Friedenbach continued.
    

            Under the mayor’s new rules, teams from San Francisco’s Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.
    

            Researchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said “punitive policing strategies” such as encampment removals “do not reduce or end homelessness.”
    

            “Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people’s eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,” the researchers said.
    

            “Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,” they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.

CNN_14,"William Calley, officer convicted for his role in My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, dead at 80",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/my-lai-massacre-william-calley-death/index.html,2024-07-31 08:34:00,us,"
            William L. Calley Jr., the only US Army soldier to be convicted in the 1968 My Lai massacre, which saw more than 300 unarmed Vietnamese civilians killed by US soldiers in one of the most notorious war crimes in American history, has died. He was 80.
    

            Calley’s death was first reported by The Washington Post, citing his death certificate. CNN later confirmed Calley died on April 28, through public records maintained by the Social Security Administration. He had been living in Gainesville, Florida, according to those records.
    

            For decades, Calley’s name was synonymous with one of the worst atrocities of the Vietnam War, as the lieutenant who led Charlie Company to My Lai, though he maintained he was following orders. While multiple officers were charged in connection with the massacre, Calley was the only one convicted.
    

            According to historians, his actions sharply divided the nation, pitting those who supported the US efforts to rout out communism against those who felt the tragedy underscored the country’s moral and ethical decline during the war.
    

            “The photograph of the Napalm Girl … the picture of General Loan shooting the Viet Cong in Saigon. Calley just brings to mind all of those things,” said Bill Allison, history professor at Georgia Southern University and author of the book “My Lai: An American Atrocity in the Vietnam War.”
    

            “But the fact is, the vast majority of the NCOs and young lieutenants and captains served with honor in Vietnam and did the best they could in this horrible situation,” Allison said.
    

            “And they didn’t wantonly kill unarmed men, women and children.”
    

            On March 16, 1968, US Army soldiers gunned down hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the remote hamlet of My Lai in South Vietnam.
    

            “It is the worst war crime in American history – certainly the worst war crime committed by soldiers in the American Army,” said retired Col. Fred Borch, a military lawyer and the former regimental historian and archivist for the US Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Corps.
    

            The US Army concluded nearly 350 people died in the attack, but the Vietnamese government puts the number at closer to 500, Borch said.
    

            A 1970 investigation by the House Armed Services Committee details what began in the early hours of the morning, when units of the Army’s 11th Brigade landed outside the small hamlet they referred to as My Lai.
    

            The soldiers, acting on flawed intelligence that a Viet Cong unit had been stationed in the village, had been briefed that “all civilians were expected to be gone from the hamlet at the time set for the assault,” according to the report.
    

             “The units involved in the My Lai operation had minimal training with respect to the handling of civilians under the Rules of Engagement and the Geneva Conventions,” the report stated.
    

            Although Charlie Company – where Calley was an officer – had yet to see direct combat, the report noted the unit had also suffered more than 40 casualties in their four months in Vietnam as a result of “mines, booby traps, and sniper fire.”
    

            Allison said some would later speculate if the attack was an attempt at “payback.” Calley would claim during his court martial hearing that he had been ordered to kill the unarmed civilians, an allegation his superiors denounced.
    

            “When they got to the village, it was full of unresisting and unarmed women and children and old men,” Borch said. “Calley and his men rounded up these civilians and then Calley ordered his men to kill them.”
    

            The massacre lasted for hours. Homes were destroyed and set ablaze. Women were raped by soldiers and an investigation later revealed that dead civilians were found on roads, in ditches and in rice paddies throughout the village. Many women died protecting children.
    

            During the melee, US Army pilot Hugh Thompson landed his helicopter between soldiers and civilians. With the help of his crew, Thompson gathered those he could and evacuated them to safety.
    

            Thompson later reported what he’d witnessed to his commanders – including a military chaplain – but it would take years before a full accounting of the massacre would come to light.
    

            The Armed Services Committee report concluded the responsible officers “failed to make adequate, timely investigation and report of the My Lai allegations.”
    

            Borch put it more bluntly.
    

            “The war crime was covered up for a year,” he said.  “Thompson reported that he had seen this war crime to his superiors, but nothing was done.”
    

            A soldier named Ron Ridenhour was so appalled to learn about the My Lai massacre from soldiers who had witnessed the attack that he began a letter campaign to lawmakers and Army commanders, demanding a federal investigation.
    

            Then, in 1969 – more than a year after the massacre and cover-up – journalist Seymour Hersh’s investigative reporting on the tragedy made headlines, and Life Magazine published gruesome images taken by an army photographer during the attack that rocked the American conscious.
    

            The country was not far removed from the atrocities of the Holocaust and World War II and Allison said the images sparked soul searching.
    

            But convicting those responsible for the massacre would prove to be a challenge.

            At the time, Allison said, the Uniform Code of Military Justice required anyone brought on charges to be an active member of the military and in the year since the attack at My Lai, many who were involved had been discharged.
    

            Calley was charged with the premeditated murder of Vietnamese civilians “literally a day or two before he was supposed to be discharged,” Allison said.
    

            An investigation and trial were held at Fort Benning, which is today known as Fort Moore, and evidence was presented to a jury of soldiers and veterans.
    

            “There was this fear that the jury of five officers might be inclined to say something like, ‘There but for the grace of God go I,’” Borch said. “But they found him guilty of premeditated murder and he was sentenced to life in prison.”
    

            A 1971 Gallup poll taken shortly after Calley’s guilty conviction found that 79% of Americans disapproved of the verdict, while only 9% approved and 12% said they had “no opinion,” The New York Times reported at the time.
    

            But in a shocking turn of events, Calley was released on parole after spending just a few years of his sentence under house arrest.
    

            Calley’s sentence was initially reduced to 20 years by the general who convened the case, Borch said. “Then, the Secretary of the Army, in an unprecedented action, reduced the sentence further to 10 years,” Borch said, adding at the time, soldiers were eligible for parole if they served a third of their sentence.
    

            President Richard Nixon intervened in the case and ordered Calley’s sentence to be reduced to house arrest, according to the Associated Press.
    

            “He was paroled almost immediately,” Borch said. “He went on with his life as a civilian.”
    

            Allison noted Nixon was heading into an election year and said he believes politics ultimately began to outweigh morality.
    

            “Everybody was sick of Vietnam,” he said. “It was in the news all the time and they just wanted to get away from Vietnam as quick as they can.”
    

            Thousands of miles away and 30 years later, those who lost loved ones in the My Lai massacre would tell CNN they were never truly able to move on.
    

            A crowd of more than 1,000 Vietnamese citizens and US soldiers gathered in 1998 in the remote village to honor those who were killed and reflect on the horrors that took place.
    

            Thompson, who was hailed as a hero by the Vietnamese for his actions that day, told those gathered at the 1998 memorial he wished they could’ve done more.
    

            “I cannot explain why it happened,” Thompson said at the time.  “I just wish our crew that day could have helped more people than we did.”
    

            Thompson and his door gunner, Lawrence Colburn, were later awarded the Army’s prestigious Soldier’s Medal for their efforts to stop the massacre.
    

            Nguyen Chung, who lost his father and his 6-year-old daughter during the massacre, told CNN he was still haunted by their memory.
    

            “I usually keep it in my heart, but the emotion grows as their death day grows near,” he said.
    

            In 2009, Calley – who had long shunned reporters – publicly apologized for his role in the massacre for the first time during a speech at the Kiwanis Club of Greater Columbus in Georgia.
    

            “There is not a day that goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day in My Lai,” Calley said, according to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. “I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry.”
    

            In response to the tragedy at My Lai – and in an effort to prevent such war crimes from happening again – Borsh said the US military began embedding military legal experts into active-duty units.
    

            “Every single military operation that’s ever planned or ever carried out now, military lawyers are involved in making sure that what’s done is legal,” he said. “And that’s all a result of a recognition that we can’t have another My Lai.”
    

            For Allison, the lesson of the massacre is also one of how war can mar both individuals and a nation.
    

            “(My Lai) reminds us how fragile the line is between who we think we are as Americans, what we value, and how we behave in war – and what war can actually do to you,” he said.
    

            “No war is a ‘good war,’ … we need to just do the best we can to ensure that the young men and women in uniform are as prepared as possible to face these moral and ethical choices.”

CNN_15,Man sentenced to 30 years to life in fatal stabbing of Christina Yuna Lee in her Manhattan apartment,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/christina-yuna-lee-assamad-nash/index.html,2024-07-31 08:01:00,us,"
            A man was sentenced to 30 years to life in state prison Tuesday for fatally stabbing a 35-year-old woman inside her New York City apartment in 2022 after following her home, according to the Manhattan district attorney’s office.
    

Assamad Nash, 27, had pleaded guilty to murder and burglary charges in June in connection with the killing of Christina Yuna Lee.
    

            CNN has sought comment from Nash’s attorney.

            “Christina Yuna Lee was killed in an unthinkably horrific manner in her own apartment at the hands of Assamad Nash,” District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. said in a news release Tuesday. “Ms. Yuna Lee was a creative, kind and joyful person and her death not only devastated her family but left a lasting impact on an entire community.”
    

            In February 2022, Nash followed Lee up to the sixth floor of her walk-up apartment in the city’s Chinatown neighborhood while remaining about a flight of stairs below her, and when Lee entered her apartment, Nash ran to the door and pushed his way inside, according to the DA’s office.
    

            Nash attempted to sexually assault Lee during the incident, the DA’s office said.
    

            After police responded to at least one neighbor’s 911 call, they heard a woman calling for help from inside the apartment. Responding officers heard Lee’s screams but were unable to breach the door, according to the DA’s release. It’s unclear why officers couldn’t immediately enter the apartment.
    

            Nash tried to flee through the fire escape but went back inside after spotting a police officer on the roof above him, the DA’s office said.
    

            Eventually, officers broke down the apartment door and found Nash hiding under Lee’s mattress and a bloodied kitchen knife hidden behind the dresser. Lee had more than 40 stab wounds, authorities said. 


            Lee’s family filed a lawsuit in May 2024 against members of the New York City Police Department and New York City, claiming delays in police assistance and medical care ultimately led to her death.
    

            The NYPD declined to comment Tuesday on pending litigation.

            New York City’s law department previously said it was reviewing the complaint. CNN sought comment from the department again Tuesday.
    

            The NYPD also declined to comment Tuesday on whether Lee’s race or ethnicity played a role in the attack, or whether the NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in the investigation. But the death of Lee, an Asian woman, in Chinatown has raised fears in New York and across the country, where anti-Asian violence has been on the rise in recent years, advocates say.

CNN_16,"Spirit Airlines, known for no-frills flying, will offer business-class seats",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/business/spirit-airlines-business-class/index.html,2024-07-31 09:43:00,us,"
            Spirit Airlines, the ultra-low cost carrier known for charging bargain-hunting passengers for anything and everything, is introducing business class seating – of a sort.
    

            The airline said it will allow customers to pay extra for what it’s calling “Go Big” class of tickets, for those passengers in one of the extra wide seats in the front of the cabin.
    

            The seats have been available for a number of years, but the new class of tickets includes a variety of extras as part of the price, including snacks and drinks (either alcoholic or non-alcoholic), one carry-on bag, one checked bag and streaming access. In the past even passengers paying extra for the big seats had to pay extra for those items. The “Go Big” class of tickets will have priority check-in, which had not previously been offered, as well as priority boarding.
    

            Farther back in the plane Spirit will also allow passengers to pay more for seats in rows where the middle seat will not be sold.
    

            It’s a sign of the trouble the airline industry has had making money selling bargain-priced seats, a trend that Spirit helped start with its low, no-frill fares. Spirit’s pricing structure, in which passengers can shop for the cheapest base fare and pay more for extras including carry-on bags, forced the major carriers to change their pricing as well, with many bringing in a “basic economy” tier for similar no-frills tickets.
    

            “We’re unveiling a new era in Spirit’s history and taking low-fare travel to new heights with enhanced options that are unlike anything we’ve offered before,” said Spirit CEO Ted Christie in a statement.
    

            No-frill tickets have proven a difficult way for airlines to make money. Spirit has not had a profitable year since 2019, the year before the pandemic brought demand for air travel to a near halt. While it has had an occasional profitable quarter, it has lost money more often than it has posted a profit. It has warned that it will soon report another quarterly loss on lower-than-forecast revenue.
    

            Even when passengers returned to the skies in 2021, low fare carries struggled, while larger legacy carriers such as American, United and Delta airlines reported record revenue.
    

            Spirit looked at merging, first with another ultra low cost carrier, Frontier Airlines, and then with JetBlue Airways. But that latter deal was blocked in January by a federal judge who ruled a deal would reduce competition and increase fares for passengers.
    

            One thing that allowed the larger carriers to do better than the ultra-low cost carriers like Spirit is the ability to sell premium seating, both wider business and first-class seats as well “economy plus” seats in the main cabin with extra legroom and the right to board first. And those legacy carriers have reported that a growing share of their ticket revenue is coming from passengers paying for premium seating.
    

            Last week Southwest Airlines, the nation’s older lower fare carrier, announced it would end its open seating policy it has used throughout its history and let passengers reserve seats for the first time. A major reason for the change was plans by Southwest to reconfigure its planes in 2025 to offer extra legroom for a premium price in one third of its rows. However, Southwest has not announced any plans to offer wider, business class seats.
    

            Southwest used to be the most profitable US airline, rarely reporting a money-losing quarter and going nearly half a century without reporting an annual loss until the pandemic hit. But it has struggled financially as well in recent years and is facing an activist investor who is pushing for a change in management to improve its profitability.
    

Correction: An earlier version of the story did not make clear what was different about the new class of tickets in the large seats at the front of Spirit planes or that the large seats had been available in the past.

CNN_17,Black journalists group faces member backlash over Trump speaking invitation,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/media/nabj-trump-invitation-backlash-black-journalists/index.html,2024-07-31 09:19:00,us,"
            The National Association of Black Journalists is trying its best to weather a storm of backlash. The organization on Tuesday drew a torrent of criticism over its decision to invite Donald Trump to sit for an interview at its annual convention in Chicago. The Wednesday afternoon Trump event — moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba — has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.
    

            Karen Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year’s conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a “variety of factors” influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.  “To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,” Attiah wrote on X, adding that she had not been “involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.”
    

            Given Trump’s adoration of authoritarianism, coupled with the vile campaign he has waged for years on the fourth estate, his appearance at any media-focused conference would be certain to generate heightened levels of controversy. But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.  “The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,” April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. “To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists … who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.”
    

            But while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that “some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ” and wondered, “So why wouldn’t they interview Trump?”   “He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don’t understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,” Sanders argued. “NABJ didn’t platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.”

            And despite Trump’s aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades. The NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, “will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.”
    

            Making matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris’ schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.
    

            “The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,” the person said. “The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.”
    

            “Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,” the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. “The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.”

CNN_18,"Who was Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader killed in Tehran?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 13:24:00,world,"
            Ismail Haniyeh has been part of Hamas for decades, in recent years running the militant group’s political operations from exile, and emerging as one of its most visible leaders during the war with Israel in Gaza.
    

            Hamas and Iranian state media said Wednesday that the 62-year-old had been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran. Hamas claimed Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli “raid” on his residence, while the Israeli military declined to comment when contacted by CNN.
    

            Haniyeh’s death strikes a significant blow to Hamas at a time when tensions are flaring across the Middle East over the devastating war in Gaza, and raises fraught questions about the future of negotiations between Israel and Hamas.
    

            As Hamas’s political leader, he was a key interlocutor with international mediators during stalled hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, following the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            Haniyeh was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
    

            His parents were refugees expelled from Askalan, which later became known as the Israeli city Ashkelon.
    

            He was imprisoned several times in Israel for his participation in the uprising, before being deported and returning to Gaza – where he steadily climbed Hamas ranks in the following decade.
    

            Haniyeh was appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004 after the deaths of Hamas’ previous two leaders, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who were killed in Israeli strikes just weeks apart.
    

            By 2017 he had become political chief of the group, and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States soon after.
    

            This decision came during a period of tension between Washington and the Palestinians due to the decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision made by the then-US President Donald Trump.
    

            Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization. He was photographed meeting Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran on Tuesday.
    

            Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7 saw at least 1,500 Hamas fighters pour across the border into Israel, in an assault that killed at least 1,200, and some 200 others taken hostage.
    

            Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health there, and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe in the densely crowded strip.
    

            In the months since, Haniyeh had been a key figure participating in international negotiations over the conflict, including the release of hostages still in Gaza.
    

            He had shown willingness to reach an agreement if Israel withdrew from Gaza – saying in May that the group was “still keen” to strike a deal with mediators, but that any proposal would have to cease fighting in the enclave permanently.
    

            At the time, he said their demands aimed to stop “the aggression against our people, which is a fundamental and logical position that lays the foundation for a more stable future.”
    

            In response, Israel has called those demands “unacceptable,” with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to keep fighting until Hamas was destroyed – leaving negotiations at a standstill as both sides traded blame.
    

            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement.
    

            Given his role in negotiations, Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.

            Throughout the war, he has also continued meeting with other world leaders and officials – including Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian, who met Haniyeh in Qatar in March, during which they discussed the war in Gaza.
    

            Haniyeh has also felt the personal toll of the war in Gaza. In April, Israeli police arrested one of his sisters on charges of communicating with members of the movement. Nine days later, Israeli airstrikes killed three of his sons and four of his grandchildren.
    

            Afterward, Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.
    

            “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.
    

            At the time, Haniyeh was based in Qatar, which is not a signatory of the Rome Statute allowing jurisdiction by the International Criminal Court.

CNN_19,Violent scenes as far-right protesters crash vigil for three girls killed in Southport knife attack,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/uk/southport-stabbing-vigil-violent-protests-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 13:14:00,world,"
            Far-right protesters violently clashed with British police on Tuesday near a mosque in the northwest English town of Southport, a day after three young girls were stabbed to death in one of the worst assaults against children in the country in decades.
    

            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the group had “hijacked” a peaceful vigil held for those killed and injured in the attack “with violence and thuggery” and “insulted the community as it grieves.”
    

            Those involved “will feel the full force of the law,” Starmer added in the post on X.
    

            The violence followed a peaceful vigil in the seaside town attended by hundreds of mourners who laid wreaths, toys and candles in an emotional tribute to the three girls who were killed during the attack during a Taylor Swift-themed event at a dance school.
    

            Protesters, believed to be supporters of the far-right English Defence League, took to the streets in anger throwing bricks at a local mosque, setting cars and police vehicles alight and hurling bottles at police, Merseyside Police said in a statement.
    

            Police believe the crowd took to the streets over unconfirmed reports speculating on the identity of the teenage suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder following Monday’s knife attack.
    

            Officers “sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion,” Merseyside Police said. “Other officers have suffered varying degrees of injury including head injuries, serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.”
    

            Three police dogs were also injured, with two sustaining leg injuries from bricks thrown at them and one suffering burns, it added.
    

            “Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face,” Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said in a police statement, referring to the horrific knife attack.
    

            “Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavour to prevent disorder,” he said.
    

            The North West Ambulance Service said it treated 39 police officers injured in the violence, 27 of whom were taken to hospital.
    

            Following the arrest in the stabbings case, an “incorrect” name linked to the suspect was spread on social media, police said.
    

            “There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” Goss said.
    

            “We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.”
    

            Police have said the suspect is from the village of Banks, near Southport, and was originally from Cardiff, Wales.
    

            Goss added that many of those involved in the violence were not local to the area, suggesting they traveled to Southport with the intention of causing unrest.
    

            The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) paid tribute to the girls killed in the attack and said in a statement that “Southport’s tragedy was shamelessly exploited to spark outrage, with Islamophobia fueling the fire and leading to tonight’s violence.”
    

            “This began with a false rumour on the internet, stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims,” it said.
    

            The MCB said the government “must address the increasing rise of violent far-right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.”

            On Tuesday, police named the three girls killed in the stabbing as Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.
    

            Eight other children suffered stab wounds in the attack and five of them are in critical condition, police said. Two adults also remain in critical condition after being injured in the attack.
    

            Police shared a tribute from the family of King, who said: “No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as we try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.”
    

            Prime Minister Starmer and other officials visited the site of the attack on Tuesday, paying tribute to the victims and thanking emergency responders who attended the scene.
    

            Starmer laid a wreath of cream and yellow-colored flowers, alongside floral tributes left by the local community.
    

            Taylor Swift, whose music was the theme of the dance class targeted in the attack, said Tuesday she was “completely in shock.”

CNN_20,"Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran, group says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 12:45:00,world,"
            Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and Hamas on Wednesday.
    

            His killing represents a significant blow to the militant group, eliminating a key figure who headed up its political operations while living overseas.
    

            In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of targeting Haniyeh in a “raid” on his residence in Tehran, following his participation in the inauguration of the new Iranian president.
    

            The Israeli military said it doesn’t respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leadership in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            It is not clear precisely when Haniyeh, a key interlocutor with Egyptian and Qatari mediators on the ongoing hostage and ceasefire talks in Gaza, was killed. The new Iranian president was sworn in on Tuesday and Hamas released pictures the same day of Haniyeh meeting Iranian officials in Tehran.
    

            The killing comes at an especially fraught time for the Middle East, with escalating confrontations between Israel and Hezbollah threatening to expand into a wider regional war and as Hamas continues to battle Israel’s military in Gaza amid an unfolding and catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
    

            Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’ Political Bureau, said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain,” while another Hamas official said the group is “ready to pay various prices.”
    

            News of Haniyeh’s death came a day after Israel said it killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a populous neighborhood that is also the Iran-backed group’s stronghold. The strike was the most serious Israeli escalation since confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel began on October 8.
    

            The White House said it has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s death but declined to immediately comment further, according to a spokesperson.
    

            Haniyeh would be the second Hamas senior leader to be killed since the beginning of Israel’s war in Gaza. In January, the group said its deputy head of the political bureau Saleh Al Arouri was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Lebanese capital Beirut. Arouri was considered one of the founding members of the Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.
    

            However, the group has been able to weather the death of other key leaders before, including slaying of its co-founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi who were killed weeks apart in 2004.
    

            CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid said the Israeli government sees Haniyeh as one of those responsible for Hamas’ October 7 attacks and while he is not militarily significant, his death “will have significant influence” on the ongoing hostage and ceasefire negotiations.
    

            “This assassination is, in a way, just a matter of when, not a matter of if,” Ravid said.
    

            Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
    

            As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. By 2017 he had become chief of the group – and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States soon after.
    

            Over the years, he has participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter, and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year.
    

            In April, Israeli airstrikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas.
    

            At the time, Haniyeh – who was based in Qatar – insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.
    

            “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.

CNN_21,India searches for survivors after landslides kill more than 150 in Kerala,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/asia/india-wayanad-landslide-deaths-rescue-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 12:11:00,world,"
            Rescue operations are ongoing in India’s southern Kerala state on Wednesday after heavy monsoon rains triggered deadly landslides that swept through homes and stranded hundreds of people, officials said.
    

            The death toll has surpassed 150, many of whom drowned, authorities said, adding that the number of casualties was expected to rise after at least two landslides hit the state’s northeastern Wayanad district in the early hours of Tuesday.
    

            Rescue workers are now facing treacherous conditions due to heavy rain, lack of power, destroyed bridges and roads blocked by fallen trees as they try to reach survivors and determine the full scope of the disaster.
    

            “We don’t know if people have been washed away in the river but we are doing our best to rescue people. We are leaving no stone unturned,” A. K. Saseendran, Kerala’s minister for forest and wildlife, told CNN Tuesday.
    

            Emergency responders at the site of the landslides – which was covered in mud and toppled trees – carried away bodies in tarps and helped residents move to safety as rain poured down.
    

            Videos posted to X by India’s National Disaster Response Force also showed rescue workers paddling through muddied water on inflatable boats to try to reach people.
    

            “Helicopters have also been brought there, but the weather is bad,” said Veena George, the state health minister, on Tuesday. “There are many challenges there because there is no electricity.”
    

            Up to 1,000 people have been rescued so far, the Indian Army’s southern command said in a post on X Wednesday.
    

            Janaki, a local resident, told CNN her family was awoken in the middle of the night to a loud noise coming from the river and water flowing through her yard. They took shelter in a neighbor’s home, she said.
    

            Then another landslide hit.
    

            “While everyone was standing in a room in fear, large stones and logs came in there,” Janaki said, sitting in a bed in a local hospital.
    

            “My two daughters and my husband survived. None of the people in the neighboring houses were seen.”
    

            Janaki’s husband, Vasu, said rescue workers arrived around 6 a.m. and brought the family to the hospital. “God saved us,” he said.
    

            Dr. Manoj Narayanan, the medical superintendent for Moopens Medical College Hospital in the village of Mepaddi told CNN that patients began arriving at the hospital near 3 a.m. local time Tuesday. The hospital had seen about 100 patients, he said, though around 10 were already dead on arrival.
    

            Some were difficult to identify because of the extent of their injuries, he said.
    

            “The injuries they are coming with include fractures, abrasions, lacerations, and quite a number of them have mud in their lungs,” Narayanan said.
    

            Narayanan said he was told there are many people who need to be rescued, including in one village of 400 households that was “inaccessible,” and bodies were still being recovered underneath the debris.

Summer of devastating floods shows steep challenge for China as it grapples with extreme weather


            CNN Weather reported widespread rainfall totals of 150 mm (6 inches) across Kerala, with some areas seeing almost 250 mm (10 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period. Kerala’s summers tend to be very wet, and these totals are standard for this time of year.
    

            Heavy flooding and mudslides have killed hundreds, displaced millions and wrecked infrastructure across South Asia in recent months. While floods are common in the region during monsoon season, scientists say the climate crisis has exacerbated extreme weather events and made them more deadly.
    

            China has also experienced weeks of damaging rain triggering floods and landslides.
    

            In a post to X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “distressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured.”
    

            His office announced payments of about $2,400 for the next of kin of those killed and about $600 each for the injured.

CNN_22,"Venezuelans have seen this movie before, but Maduro should beware. This time, the ending could be different",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/americas/venezuela-election-maduro-analysis-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-31 10:23:00,world,"
            It happened in Caracas on June 9, 2016, when I was there to cover a series of violent protests that had broken out in Venezuela.
    

            That sunny day, as our CNN team was walking towards the building that houses the National Assembly for interviews, we noticed a group of men heading the same way from the opposite side of the street.
    

            “Hurry up!,” CNN en español’s correspondent in Caracas Osmary Hernández said. “I think the colectivos are up the street.” We all picked up our pace and breathed a sigh of relief when we made it to the building. Colectivos are armed groups that function like a street gang, but are closely affiliated with the socialist government and often do their dirty work.
    

            Moments after we made it inside the building, Julio Borges, an opposition member of the assembly and its former president, arrived in bad shape. He had a bloody nose and said a group of opposition legislators like him had been attacked by colectivos as they were headed to the office of the national electoral authority. The month before, President Nicolás Maduro had declared a “constitutional state of emergency.”
    

            Even before that tumultuous period, it had become abundantly clear that Maduro’s government had absolute control of all three branches of government as well as the the National Electoral Council (CNE).
    

            And, as we had just witnessed, it also controlled the streets of Caracas. Maduro, now 61, is a former bus driver who became a Caracas metro system union leader and rose through the ranks. He is the handpicked successor of the late strongman Hugo Chávez, who ruled Venezuela from 1999 until his death in 2013.
    

            A new wave of violence shook Venezuela once again in 2019. In January of that year, Juan Guaidó, then president of the National Assembly, had proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela. The then-35-year-old Guaidó argued that he had the constitutional right to the presidency as leader of the assembly because Maduro, who had been sworn in only days before, was an illegitimate president.
    

            Both the opposition and leaders of several countries in the region had called the previous year’s election a sham. Guaidó convinced 50 countries that he had a right to be president, including the United States.
    

            By June 2019, when I returned to Caracas, Guaidó had already attempted a military uprising that almost succeeded on April 30, followed by weeks of violent clashes between protesters and security forces that left dozens dead.
    

            The world started to pay close attention to Venezuela once again in the last few months as the country was getting ready to hold a new presidential election. Would Maduro allow the opposition to run a candidate of its choosing? Would this be a free, fair, and transparent election? Would the colectivos once again be used to intimidate voters as they had done in previous elections?

Venezuela is wracked with protests and election uncertainty. Here’s what to know


            The first and second questions were answered in January when opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred by Venezuela’s highest court from running for president (or any other elected position) for 15 years over alleged financial irregularities. Machado had won more than 90% of the vote in last October’s opposition primary. She attracted large crowds everywhere she went, even though the government did everything possible to stop her, even persecuting those who rented sound systems to her campaign.
    

            The third question was answered in the last hours of the election itself on Sunday when colectivos showed up at at least one polling center in Caracas and started beating up opposition sympathizers who had been asked by the leadership to keep an eye on ballot boxes in an effort to prevent tampering.
    

            Those of us who have been following Venezuela for decades have seen this movie before: a “sham” election to justify Maduro’s staying in power. Democracy has been gradually weakening in Venezuela over the last 25 years since the charismatic socialist leader Chávez rose to power in 1999.
    

            While Venezuelans and the world awaited results Sunday night, the country’s electoral authority delayed publication, alleging the system had been targeted by hackers operating from North Macedonia without showing any evidence. This was not surprising in a country where all three branches of government are in the hands of government loyalists, hundreds of opposition leaders have been imprisoned, and true democracy hasn’t existed in a generation.
    

            “Is there anything different this time?” That’s the question I asked Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue and current professor of Latin American Politics at Georgetown University, who has been following Venezuelan politics for decades.
    

            Shifter said the Maduro victory was a “blatant, massive and egregious fraud,” but the opposition managed to do something it had been unable to do before: uniting behind a single candidate and going to the polls in massive numbers.
    

            “The alternative [to participating in the election] was taking themselves completely out of the political game, saying ‘we refuse to take part in this unfair and unjust election,’ but that would’ve left the opposition in a weaker position in practical and political terms” as it happened in 2018 when the opposition decided to boycott the whole process.
    

            “I think the opposition learned that refusing to take part in elections was not helping their cause.  They recognized that even when the elections weren’t free and fair, they needed to defeat Maduro on his terms, which they’ve done,” Shifter said.
    

            Venezuela’s CNE declared Maduro the winner Monday saying he had won with 51.2% of the votes, with 80% of the ballots counted. His main rival, opposition candidate Edmundo González, had obtained 44.2% of the votes, according to the body.

Protests erupt in Venezuela as questions grow over strongman Maduro’s victory


            Critics like former Bolivian President Jorge Fernando “Tuto” Quiroga, who was one of several former heads of state prevented from flying to Venezuela by its government as they tried to serve as observers, called the Maduro government a “desperate regime; an open, pure and hard tyranny that has chosen to steal the presidency staging a fraudulent coronation.” In an interview with CNN, he said that even the math didn’t add up when Venezuelan electoral authorities declared a winner with 80% of the vote counted.
    

            “When you’re in first grade, you learn that 20 is more than seven,” Quiroga said. “The probability that [opposition presidential candidate] Edmundo [González] could’ve won was low, but still arithmetically possible,” at that point, he said, adding that prior to the election there were credible exit polls showing González was ahead by as much as 40 percent.
    

            Just like 2016 and 2019, violence has returned to Venezuela. At least 11 people died during protests in Venezuela on Monday, according to the non-governmental organization Foro Penal on social media. Venezuelan authorities say more than 700 people were detained in the protests. The Venezuelan opposition political party Voluntad Popular said Tuesday that its leader Freddy Superlano has been kidnapped.
    

            Unlike the 2018 election, Shifter says, this time the opposition “knows they won, and the regime knows they won.” The question now is how long the governing coalition that includes not only the socialists, but the armed forces can hold, Shifter said.
    

            If that coalition becomes “divided and weaker, the armed forces may say ‘this ship is sinking and we don’t want to go down with it,’” Shifter said.

            Francine Pascal, a onetime soap opera writer whose “Sweet Valley High” novels and the ongoing adventures of twins Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield and other teens captivated millions of young readers, has died at age 92.
    

            Pascal died Sunday, her publisher, Penguin Random House, said. It did not immediately have additional information Tuesday.
    

            Starting in 1983, Francine Pascal oversaw the completion of more than 150 “Sweet Valley High” stories with the help of others. They were set in an imaginary Los Angeles suburb, one of “gently rolling hills” and a “fantastic white sand beach” nearby. In best sellers such as “Double Love,” “Power Play” and “All Night Long,” the Wakefield girls and their schoolmates navigate dating, family conflicts, sibling rivalries, more troubling themes such as race, divorce and mortality and even vampires and werewolves.

            “Sweet Valley is the essence of high school,” Pascal told People magazine in 1988. “It’s that moment before reality hits, when you really do believe in the romantic values — sacrifice, love, loyalty, friendship — before you get jaded and slip off into adulthood.”
    

            Her books sold more than 200 million copies, and included “Sweet Valley” spinoffs and sequels. After the initial novels took off, Pascal brought in outside writers, providing them general outlines and a “bible” of the books’ characters.
    

            “It was mostly very young, new writers,” she told Entertainment Weekly in 2019. “The story outlines weren’t chapter by chapter, more like acts: You get from here to here in the first quarter, then you have to get from here to here. Don’t forget, they already had the bible, where I had written deeply into the lives of the twins and their backgrounds. With the characters, you knew what they liked, you knew what the walls in their room (looked like), every single thing about them.”
    

            Born Francine Paula Rubin, Pascal was a New York City native who studied journalism at New York University, wrote for such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Ladies’ Home Journal and, with second husband John Pascal, found work with the soap opera “The Young Marrieds.” When Francine Pascal began thinking of creating her own series, she took a friend’s advice and developed what became the Sweet Valley books.

CNN_25,"‘Catastrophic flooding’ forces water rescues in Vermont after 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/weather/vermont-flooding-rain-climate/index.html,2024-07-31 11:53:00,world,"
            Emergency responders sprang into action early Tuesday to rescue residents in flooded areas of northeast Vermont after a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event created a surge of dangerous floodwaters for the second time in a matter of weeks.
    

            Ten swift-water rescue teams completed about two dozen rescues in Caledonia and Essex counties, some of the hardest-hit areas, where flash flood emergencies warning of “catastrophic flooding” were issued and the storm unleashed inches of rainfall in just a few hours.
    

            Nearly 8 inches of rain fell in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in just 6 hours, an amount considered a 1-in-1,000 year event – one so extreme, it usually only happens once every thousand years in normal conditions. A total of 8.41 inches fell there in what is one of the highest calendar day totals in state history, the National Weather Service in Vermont said.


Extreme rainfall is becoming more common as fossil fuel pollution pushes temperatures higher and bolsters the atmosphere’s ability to store more water vapor. Scientists are very confident that climate change is increasing rainfall rates – how hard the rain is falling – and the amount of rain a storm can produce.
    

            Rescue teams remain in the area Tuesday to respond to potential additional calls for help throughout the day with more rainfall possible this afternoon into the evening, according to Vermont Emergency Management.
    

            Floodwaters have washed out roads and several state road closures are in effect.
    

            A team was heading out to survey the damage, which included “quite a bit” of structural and road damage, National Weather Service meteorologist Seth Kutikoff told the Associated Press.
    

            “We do know, unfortunately, some of these same areas were hit three weeks ago with some serious flash flooding, as well,” he said. “The integrity of some structures were already weakened.”
    

            In Lyndonville, a town about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Montpelier, the state capital, Deryck Colburn said he woke up to a neighbor pounding on his door. They live along a brook.
    

            “I went down the road to her house, and there was no road. There was just a river,” he said.
    

            Colburn said he heard the same surge of rushing water he’d heard in flooding earlier in July, along with the unnerving sound of tumbling boulders carried by the water.
    

            The nearby Passumpsic River rose 13 feet in four hours as floodwater surged into it.
    

            This is the third devastating flood event to hit Vermont in just over a year.
    

            More than 100 people were rescued and at least one person died in early July after the remnants of Hurricane Beryl doused the state.
    

            Northeast Vermont and other portions of the state are also still recovering from more extensive flooding just over a year ago. Last year’s flooding caused numerous road and bridge washouts, land and mudslides resulting in significant property damage and loss.
    

            The owners of Papa Tirozzi’s Bakery, Pizza and Fish Shack believed they already saw the worst of Mother Nature when their restaurant’s driveway was destroyed from the remnants of Beryl earlier this month.
    

            On Tuesday they learned they were wrong.
    

            “(Our driveway) was annihilated,” Nancy Tirozzi told CNN Tuesday. “But now, it’s 20 times worse.”
    

            Nancy and her husband, Anthony, rushed to their restaurant in St. Johnsbury, about two hours east of Burlington, as soon as they got an emergency weather warning around 4 a.m.
    

            “We had no idea anything like this was gonna happen,” Nancy said, adding the floodwaters were up to 5 feet deep outside the restaurant when they arrived. Once they had receded, the couple turned toward working tirelessly to try to clean up the mess.
    

            “I can’t stop crying,” Nancy said. “It’s bad, it’s really, really, bad. This community has been hurt.”
    

            The property itself was too damaged to repair themselves, so the couple focused their energy on the inside of the building, sweeping out water and mud and ripping out the molding on the floor.
    

            They hope they can clean up enough to reopen in the next few days, but their hurried work might be for nought.
    

            “When you’re not open, you can’t make money,” Nancy said. “But at this point, you can’t get to us. Our street is closed down,” she added.
    

            Nancy’s belief in her tight-knit community is what is pulling her through this moment of despair. That, and the thought of supplying them again soon with food that brings them together.

CNN_26,Venezuela is wracked with protests and election uncertainty. Here’s what to know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/americas/venezuela-protests-election-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 14:48:00,world,"
            Criticism is mounting against Venezuela’s authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro after deadly protests erupted across the country following its disputed presidential election.
    

            Venezuela’s opposition and multiple Latin American leaders have refused to recognize Maduro’s victory in the July 28 vote, which was announced by the country’s electoral authority - a body stacked with the president’s allies.
    

            At least 11 people have been killed in the protests, according to non-governmental organization Foro Penal, and Venezuelan authorities say nearly 750 people have been arrested.
    

            CNN has not yet been able to verify the death toll and has reached out to the Venezuelan police.
    

            Meanwhile, an important opposition figure was allegedly kidnapped, according to his supporters, while the country’s army, which has long backed Maduro, reaffirmed its support for the strongman.
    

            The election was seen as the most consequential poll in years, with Venezuela’s stalling democracy and hopes of recovering its shattered economy on the line.
    

            Though Maduro had promised free and fair elections, the process was marred with allegations of foul play – with opposition figures arrested, their key leader banned from running, opposition witnesses allegedly denied access to the centralized vote count, and overseas Venezuelans largely unable to vote.
    

            Many young opposition supporters said they would leave the country if Maduro was re-elected, pointing to the devastating collapse of Venezuela’s economy and violent repression under his rule. But an energized opposition movement, which enjoyed strong polling figures prior to the vote, had been seen as the ruling establishment’s toughest challenge in 25 years.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

            Maduro has been in power since the 2013 death of his predecessor Hugo Chávez. If he takes office again, it will be his third consecutive six-year term and the continuation of “Chavismo,” the left-wing populist ideology named after the former leader.
    

            On the other side is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition. Its energized campaign stoked hope among a disillusioned populace that was desperate for change, in a country in such dire economic straits that some 8 million Venezuelans have fled overseas.
    

            The opposition candidate, former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez, stepped into the role after the highly popular, center-right leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running, following allegations she didn’t include some food vouchers on her asset declaration.
    

            But many still see Machado, an avowed capitalist, as a driving force behind the opposition, which had promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy and rebuild its once impressive economy if it won.
    

            The results are disputed. The National Electoral Council (CNE) officially declared Maduro the winner late Sunday, with 80% of ballots counted. It said Maduro had won 51.2% of the votes, while Gonzalez received 44.2%.
    

            The CNE has yet to issue final vote tallies.
    

            But the opposition has rejected the results, claiming their own tallies showed Gonzalez had won. On Monday, they said they had obtained more than 73% of the tally sheets showing more than 6 million votes for Gonzalez and only 2.7 million for Maduro.
    

            Speaking from the capital Caracas, Gonzalez and Machado said all their tallies had been verified and shared online for the public and global leaders to see – something world leaders and opposition figures have called on the CNE to do.
    

            Maduro pledged to release all voting data in a private conversation Monday with Brazilian foreign policy envoy Celso Amorim, according to a source who was knowledgeable about the conversation.
    

            Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the only way to end the electoral dispute in Venezuela is to publish the vote tallies. “There is a fight. How do you solve the fight? Publish the tallies,” Lula da Silva said in an interview aired on Brazilian broadcaster Globo.
    

            Lula said Maduro and the opposition must present their results. If there are discrepancies, the opposition should file an appeal and await a legal decision, he said. He also criticized the effects of “external management” from other countries, adding that the international community has the “obligation” to accept the results once the tallies are released.
    

            Losing power could have devastating consequences for Maduro, who is facing drug trafficking and corruption charges in the US and is under investigation for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. If he was to relinquish control without an agreement in place, he could end up in prison.
    

            The vote’s outcome is expected to be felt across the Americas – including the United States – in the form of migration.
    

            Opposition leaders decried alleged irregularities on Sunday as the votes were being processed and counted.
    

            The opposition said its witnesses were denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters as votes were being counted; their presence was supposed to ensure transparency and fairness.
    

            Only a very limited number of election observers were allowed to monitor the vote. These included The Carter Center, which said Tuesday night it could not verify the results declared by the CNE, which “cannot be considered democratic.”
    

            “Venezuela’s electoral process did not meet international standards of electoral integrity at any of its stages and violated numerous provisions of its own national laws,” it said.

            The United Nations was also present, with a spokesperson saying afterward that UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for “complete transparency” and for the electoral body to “undertake their work independently and without interference to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate.”
    

            The opposition also alleged that the CNE had halted data being sent from polling stations to the central body, thus preventing more votes from being processed.
    

            The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it has denied. Maduro’s government controls almost all state institutions, including the CNE, which was accused in 2017 of manipulating turnout figures by a software company that provided the voting technology. The CNE previously denied the assertion.
    

            CNN reached out to the CNE for comment on Monday. The body has not yet addressed the opposition’s allegations.
    

            Though Maduro supporters celebrated his win in parts of Caracas, Monday was marked by wider protests by the opposition.
    

            In Caracas, hundreds of people marched through the streets, waving Venezuelan flags and chanting, “Liberty!”
    

            Videos from across the country, from Charallave to Caucagüita, show crowds banging pots — a rattling cacophony so loud it can be heard from far away across an entire city. This Latin American practice is known as “cacerolazo” – a spontaneous, accessible form of protest also used in Chile and Spain.
    

            CNN teams witnessed dozens of national guard soldiers in riot gear repressing the mostly peaceful protests with tear gas and batons.
    

            “We want peace for Venezuela, for our family members,” a protester, who chose not to be identified, told reporting teams on the ground.
    

            Maduro decried the protests on Monday, saying his government “knows how to confront this situation and defeat those who are violent.” He also claimed, without providing evidence, that the majority of the protestors were hate-filled criminals and that their plan was hatched in the US.
    

            Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said 749 people had been detained in Monday’s protests. Saab rejected the notion that the demonstrations were peaceful, claiming that they resulted in the injuries of 48 military and police officers.
    

            Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López called the protests an attempted coup d’état and said the armed forces reaffirmed their “absolute loyalty and unconditional support” to Maduro.
    

            Venezuelan opposition party Voluntad Popular said Tuesday that its leader Freddy Superlano has been kidnapped. Several people dressed in black allegedly intercepted the car in which Superlano was traveling, forcibly removed him and put him in a van, according to a video the party published on social media.
    

            CNN is trying to contact the Venezuelan authorities to get their version of this complaint.
    

            A resident of Caracas who did not want to be identified over safety concerns told CNN they witnessed the incident. “Around 9.40 a.m., I heard some trucks and brakes,” he told CNN. “Several hooded individuals with long weapons get out of the gray truck. They start hitting the car windows with their weapons.”
    

            According to the local, two passengers inside the car that was being targeted were then taken. “Everything happened in less than three minutes,” they said.
    

            For Venezuelans this is grimly familiar territory. Previous periods of opposition protests have resulted in harsh crackdowns by the police and military, which have a long history of protecting the Chavismo system, including in 2017 and 2019.
    

            Many regional and world leaders have cast doubt on the results, including the US – though some of Venezuela’s partners have stood by Maduro.
    

            “We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people. It’s critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently, that election officials immediately share information with the opposition and independent observers without delay,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Monday.
    

            The foreign ministers and offices of several European nations, including the United Kingdom and Spain, voiced similar concerns.
    

            The Organization of American States (OAS) said the election results could not be recognized due to a lack of transparency and evidence, in a 23-page report that found the CNE failed to provide details of the ballots processed.

            It also said that other factors make it impossible to grant “democratic recognition” to the official results. These include CNE’s resistance to national and international observation, a reluctance to allow witnesses from the opposition to enter voting centers, and a “contradiction between the announced percentages and the citizen verification exercises,” among other things.
    

            The report accused the Maduro government of political persecution of opposition leaders, noting in particular Machado’s disqualification as a candidate.
    

            “The regime of Nicolás Maduro has once again betrayed the Venezuelan people, declaring that it respects the popular will while doing everything possible to manipulate and ignore that will,” the OAS report concluded.
    

            Other Latin American countries, including Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay refused to recognize the results and had their diplomatic staff in country expelled Monday.
    

            The Maduro government accused the nations of being a “group of right-wing Washington-subordinate governments, openly committed to the most sordid fascist ideological positions.”
    

            Some of Maduro’s close allies, like China, Cuba, Iran and Russia, were quick to congratulate him.
    

            On Tuesday, Venezuela’s main international airport was rammed with travelers attempting to beat the suspension of commercial flights linking the country to Panama and the Dominican Republic. Venezuela’s transport minister said flights were being suspended to those countries over what it considered “interventionist actions of right-wing governments.”
    

            Panama is considered a major transit hub connecting South, Central and North America, including the US.
    

            Once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, Venezuela has experienced the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history.
    

            The economic and political crisis brought about by a crash in the price of oil – a key export for Venezuela – combined with chronic corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government officials.
    

            Venezuela is now suffering chronic shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation, while the goods available are too expensive for most people – pushing millions to flee, including thousands who have trekked north to the US’ southern border.
    

            The US and European Union have imposed punishing sanctions on Maduro’s regime for years, which he has blamed for the crisis, saying Venezuela was victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Last year, Maduro had pledged to hold fair and free elections in exchange for sanctions relief, in US-brokered talks. But after Sunday’s elections, the accusations of fraud now cast doubt on whether Venezuela will be able to return to the international stage.

CNN_27,Hamas political leader Haniyeh’s assassination deepens fears of an all-out war in the Middle East,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 14:25:00,world,"
            Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and Hamas on Wednesday, a major escalation that deepens fears of an all-out war in the Middle East.
    

            Haniyeh is the second leader of an Iran-backed militant group reported to have been assassinated in recent days. His death represents a significant blow to Hamas, eliminating its most public figure who headed up the group’s political operations while living overseas.
    

            In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of targeting Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a “strike” on his residence in Tehran, following his participation in Tuesday’s inauguration of the new Iranian president.
    

            Israel’s military said it does not respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leadership in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. It later said it was “conducting a situational assessment.”
    

            In contrast, Israel did confirm it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah’s most senior military commander, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The assassination of Fu’ad Shukr was the most serious Israeli escalation since confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel began on October 8.
    

            It is not clear precisely when Haniyeh, a key interlocutor with Egyptian and Qatari mediators on the ongoing hostage and ceasefire talks in Gaza, was killed. The new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in on Tuesday and Hamas released pictures the same day of Haniyeh meeting Iranian officials in Tehran.
    

            The killing comes at an especially fraught time for the Middle East, with escalating confrontations between Israel and Hezbollah threatening to expand into a wider regional war and as Hamas continues to battle Israel’s military in Gaza amid an unfolding and catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
    

            Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’ Political Bureau, said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain,” while senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri called it a “grave escalation.”
    

            The White House said it has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s death but declined to immediately comment further, according to a spokesperson. While traveling in the Philippines, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but if Israel were to be attacked the US would help defend it.
    

            Haniyeh would be the second Hamas senior leader to be killed since the beginning of Israel’s war in Gaza. In January, the group said its deputy head of the political bureau Saleh Al Arouri was killed in an Israeli airstrike in the Lebanese capital Beirut. Arouri was considered one of the founding members of the Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.
    

            However, the group has been able to weather the death of other key leaders before, including slaying of its co-founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi who were killed weeks apart in 2004.

            CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid said the Israeli government sees Haniyeh as one of those responsible for Hamas’ October 7 attacks and while he is not militarily significant, his death “will have significant influence” on the ongoing hostage and ceasefire negotiations.
    

            “This assassination is, in a way, just a matter of when, not a matter of if,” Ravid said.
    

            The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, said Haniyeh’s death was under investigation and results will be announced later Wednesday, according to Iranian state media.
    

            Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh’s killing calling it “a cowardly act and a dangerous development,” according to the WAFA news agency on Wednesday.
    

            “His Excellency called on the masses and forces of our people to unite, be patient and steadfast in the face of the Israeli occupation,” WAFA reported.
    

            The reported deaths of Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah’s Shukr in Beirut - two leaders of different Iran-backed militant groups - in just a few days are significant in both their timing and location.
    

            Brigadier General (Res.) Assaf Orion, senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies said the two reported deaths “increase the likelihood of an axis response, adding Iran and other proxy attacks to the menu.”

Israeli strike targeting a top Hezbollah military leader takes region to the brink of all-out war


            Iran has spent years investing in regional proxy groups, informally known as the “Axis of Resistance” — an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance — supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence across the Middle East.
    

            Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has brought that longstanding shadow war with Iran out into the open – and inflamed opinion globally.
    

            Though Israel has not commented on Heniyah’s death, it has vowed to eliminate Hamas leadership and has a history of carrying out assassinations in Iran as well as against Iranian targets.
    

            In April, Iran accused Israel of bombing its embassy complex in Syria killing at least seven officials including Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi. In response, Iran launched an unprecedented large-scale drone and missile attack at Israel.
    

            Earlier this month, Israel targeted Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza which killed at least 90 Palestinians. An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks though it remains unclear whether he is dead.
    

            Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
    

            As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. By 2017 he had become chief of the group – and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States soon after.
    

            Over the years, he has participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter, and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year.
    

            In April, Israeli airstrikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas.
    

            At the time, Haniyeh – who was based in Qatar – insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.
    

            “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.
    

This is a developing story and will be updated.

CNN_28,Florida’s Broward County school district suspends staffer whose transgender daughter played on a girls’ team,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/transgender-athlete-volleyball-broward-county-florida/index.html,2024-07-31 15:06:00,us,"
            A South Florida school district on Tuesday voted to give a 10-day suspension to an employee accused of allowing her transgender daughter to play on a girls’ high school volleyball team in 2022 and 2023 in violation of state law.
    

            The suspension of Jessica Norton, an information management technician and a volunteer junior varsity volleyball coach at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, was approved in a 5-4 vote by the Broward County school board.
    

            Norton will be moved to a different job after the suspension ends, the board said. Superintendent Howard Hepburn had recommended Norton be fired, citing the district’s investigation of the situation, though board members voting in the majority followed a district committee’s recommendation that Norton be suspended.
    

            After Tuesday’s meeting, Norton expressed mixed feelings about the vote.
    

            “Obviously, I don’t want to get fired from my job. I love my job,” she said. “But I don’t think that the decision for any suspension was correct.”

Florida principal reassigned during investigation into transgender student playing on girls’ volleyball team


            Norton and several other school staff members were reassigned to non-school sites in November, pending an investigation, after district officials learned her transgender daughter played on the school’s varsity volleyball team. Of the school staff members reassigned in November, only Norton was not cleared of wrongdoing.
    

            Under Florida’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which was signed into law in 2021 by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, transgender girls are banned from playing on girls’ sports teams at public schools in Florida.
    

            In December, state athletic officials said Monarch High was placed on one-year administrative probation and fined $16,500 for allowing the transgender girl to play on the girls’ volleyball team.
    

            In a three-page letter to Monarch High School’s interim principal, the Florida High School Athletic Association accused the school of violating the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act and an association bylaw, both of which prohibit “biological males” from playing on women’s sports teams at public schools. The transgender student played 33 matches during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 volleyball seasons, the letter stated.
    

            Norton’s daughter, who now attends school virtually, was banned from playing sports for any member school” through November 2024, according to the letter.

            In a March response to the investigation, Norton’s lawyers stressed that Norton was a volunteer junior varsity volleyball coach – not a coach for the varsity team – and “had no role, responsibility, or authority in the try-out and selection process for either team, nor in running any practices or coaching in games.”
    

            At Tuesday’s meeting, Norton walked out at one point after a board member repeatedly referred to Norton’s daughter as “her son” while reading from a state Department of Education report and making her own observations.
    

            Norton said she has not decided whether she will return to Monarch High School.
    

            “I loved my job, and I loved my students. I loved everything about it. … We’ll see what happens,” she said, adding she would discuss her future at the school with her daughter.
    

            Under Florida’s law, public secondary school and college sports teams are required to be designated based on “biological sex.” The act defines a student’s “biological sex” as the one that was printed on the student’s official birth certificate at or near the time of birth.
    

            The Florida case came amid a nationwide spate of legal backlash against transgender students’ participation in school sports, particularly in Republican-led states.

CNN_29,A third girl has died in the UK after one of the worst attacks on children in decades. Here’s what to know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/uk/southport-stabbing-attack-explainer/index.html,2024-07-31 15:10:00,world,"
            The United Kingdom was left shaken after three children were stabbed to death and eight others were injured in a knife attack in Southport, in one of the worst assaults against children in the country in decades.
    

            The attack took place at a Taylor Swift themed event at a dance school in the seaside town in northwest England, sparking disbelief over why would anyone target children having fun during the summer holiday.
    

            Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the “whole country” was deeply shocked by the “truly awful” attack, while King Charles III said he was “profoundly shocked” by the “utterly horrific incident.”
    

            Here is what we know about the attack.
    

            Police said Monday two girls, aged 6 and 7, were killed and six of the nine that were injured were in critical condition. Officers said the following day that another child, a 9-year-old girl, had died as a result of her injuries.
    

            Two adults were also critically injured, police said, adding that they suffered their injures because they “were bravely trying to protect the children who were being attacked.”
    

            Merseyside Police said the attack took place at a Taylor Swift event at a dance school in Southport on Monday morning, and the force said it received a call for help just before midday. Emergency services, including 13 ambulances and other specialized resources, were sent to the scene and a “major incident” was declared.
    

            Police named the girls who died in the attack as Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Bebe King, 6, and 7-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.
    

            Photographs of the three victims that were shared by their families show Alice wearing a princess-like white dress, while Elsie is pictured smiling into the camera in what appears to be a school uniform. Bebe is shown sporting two ponytails, looking delighted while pointing to her t-shirt that shows the picture of Elphaba and Galinda, the two witches from the “Wicked” musical.
    

            Police also shared a tribute from the family of Bebe King who said: “No words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe.”
    

            The parents of Dasilver Aguiar called the nine-year-old “our princess” and said: “Keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our Princess, like we said before to you, you’re always our princess and no one would change that.”
    

            The police said a 17-year-old minor was arrested at the scene on “suspicion of murder and attempted murder.” He was taken to the police station and was being interviewed on Tuesday morning, the police said.
    

            Merseyside Police’s Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said the suspect was from Banks in Lancashire and was originally from Cardiff in Wales.
    

            She said the suspect was armed with a knife when he walked into the school in Southport, but give no other details on him or his apparent motive, other than saying the attack was not being treated as terror-related.
    

            The incident on Monday is the worst mass stabbing attack targeting children in the UK in decades – and possibly ever. While knife crime has risen across the country over the past decade – with a slight dip during the pandemic years – mass stabbing incidents are extremely rare.
    

            The number of knife crimes in England rose to 48,341 in the year to April 2024, from 27,667 in the year to April 2014, according for the Office for National Statistics. More than a quarter of the incidents took place in London.
    

            But children have been targeted in the UK in other types of attacks. Several children, including an 8-year old girl were killed in a terror attack at the concert of pop singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in May 2017.
    

            And 16 children aged between 5 and 6 were murdered in a school shooting in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996. The massacre stunned the country and led to a ban on the private ownership of all handguns in mainland Britain.
    

            Many in the area and across the country were left in disbelief after learning about what happened. Southport is a small seaside resort and a popular summer destination for families.
    

            Starmer and other officials visited the site of the attack on Tuesday, paying tributes to the victims and thanking emergency responders who attended the scene.
    

            Starmer laid a wreath of cream and yellow-colored flowers at the scene, alongside floral tributes left there by the local community.
    

            Taylor Swift, whose music was the theme of the dance class that was targeted by the attack, said Tuesday she was “completely in shock.”
    

            “The horror of yesterday’s attack in Southport is washing over me continuously, and I’m just completely in shock. The loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families, and first responders. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families,” Swift wrote on Instagram on Tuesday.
    

            Merseyside Police said Tuesday that far-right protesters clashed with police in Southport, throwing bricks at a local mosque, setting cars and police vehicles alight and hurling bottles at police.
    

            Prime Minister Starmer said the group had “hijacked” the peaceful vigil “with violence and thuggery” and those involved “will feel the full force of the law.”
    

            Police said the protesters are believed to be supporters of the far-right English Defence League, who took to the streets over unconfirmed reports speculating that the attacker was Muslim.
    

            “There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody, and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said in the statement.
    

            “We have already said that the person arrested was born in the UK, and speculation helps nobody at this time.”
    

            Officers were deployed to the scene and faced “criminal behavior and violence with bottles and wheelie bins being thrown at them.”
    

            “Yesterday, our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavor to prevent disorder,” Goss said.
    

            The North West Ambulance Service said it treated 39 police officers injured in the violence, 27 of whom were taken to hospital.
    

            Officers “sustained serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion,” Merseyside Police said. “Other officers have suffered varying degrees of injury including head injuries, serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.”
    

            Three police dogs were also injured, it added.

CNN_30,How rock icon Jimi Hendrix inspired one of Africa’s greatest guitarists,https://edition.cnn.com/world/africa/louis-mhlanga-guitar-jimi-hendrix-spc/index.html,2024-07-31 16:22:00,world,"
            Award-winning jazz guitarist Louis Mhlanga has always let music take center stage.
    

            For the 67-year-old award-winning Zimbabwean, music has been the sole focus of his life. “I did nothing else except make music throughout my life; that’s what I’ve been doing, and I keep doing,” he told CNN, a testament to his unwavering dedication to his craft.
    

            Growing up during the 1960s music revolution, Mhlanga remembers his mother playing Ella Fitzgerald and Mahalia Jackson records. However, it was his professional musician brothers, William and Shaft, who introduced him to the guitar and were his first inspiration.
    

            “I would just watch and listen (to them), and when they are gone, that’s the time I would pick up a guitar and try to copy what they’ve been doing,” Mhlanga said.
    

            His brothers also introduced him to the music of the guitarist who would become his idol — Jimi Hendrix.
    

            “I got inspired by one album of Jimi Hendrix,” recalled Mhlanga. That album was “Band of Gypsys,” ﻿released in 1970.
    

            “My brother brought it home, and I thought, wow, that guitar,” Mhlanga added. “My brother kept repeating it, and it was like he was injecting me with this music.”
    

            One especially memorable song was “Machine Gun.” The 12-minute jam-style protest of the Vietnam War is often hailed as Hendrix’s greatest work. It showcases a stunning display of guitar virtuosity.
    

            “His approach to the music and the ideas that he was introducing, the sustain of the guitar which he used and the feedback, I don’t think anybody was doing what he was doing,” Mhlanga explained. “Even today, it still keeps me going.”
    

            Mhlanga’s musical journey has a rich tapestry of influences. He delved into the electrifying beats of rock legends like The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath, while also being captivated by the soulful melodies of Motown icons such as The Temptations and Marvin Gaye. His exploration extended to sounds from China and India, creating a diverse and intriguing musical palette.
    

            “The music of way back then had a lot of messages which was building people’s thoughts, people’s behavior, which was bringing people together and had so much love in it,” said the guitarist. “All that music really play(ed) a part in my growth.”
    

            Professionally, Mhlanga started fronting bands in the late 1970s, mixing both American and Zimbabwean influences. Still, it was through collaboration that he made his mark, working with Zimbabwean music icon Oliver Mtukudzi.
    

            Venturing further, he immersed himself in the rich guitar traditions of southern and West Africa, infusing the traditional mbira rhythms of the Shona people into his own vibrant and modern electric guitar style. Fusing together all these sounds, Mhlanga says, has enhanced his creativity.
    

            “I thought maybe I should try and pick up some traditional songs and change them and play them in my own way, and that kind of worked,” Mhlanga said.
    

            “I think all those different cultures are a melting pot for me, so it also brings out something different to me,” he added.
    

            Mhlanga was intent on making his mark on the jazz scene, which meant composing his own music and blending jazz, rock and traditional Zimbabwean sounds.
    

            “Slowly, I injected that idea into my mind, and it started growing within me. A song came up, another one came up and kept on growing, and the rest is now history,” he said.
    

            Seeking new opportunities, Mhlanga joined The Beaters in 1976 on the invitation of band leader Sipho Mabuse, and relocated to South Africa.
    

            While in South Africa, he collaborated with some of the country’s biggest acts, including Hugh Masekela, Miriam Makeba and Vusi Mahlasela. These collaborations not only expanded his musical horizons but also solidified his position in the music industry.
    

            Affected by the woes of living in a brutal apartheid state, he relocated to the UK, seeking a more conducive environment for his music. However, his heart remained in South Africa, and he eventually returned, determined to contribute to the country’s vibrant music scene.
    

            Mhlanga released his first solo album in 2000 and has since released more than 10 solo albums, EPs, and collaborative projects.
    

            The musician was featured on the 1996 collaborative album “Place of Hope” alongside George Duke, James Ingram and Al Jarreau. In addition to releasing an album with American jazz steel pannist Andy Narell, he recently released “Two Words” with Budha Building (a pseudonym of Dutch musician Hans Timmermans).
    

            After more than half a century playing his guitar, Mhlanga still aims to transform the African jazz sound. His latest album, “Living for the Living,” released earlier this year, aims to unite, uplift, and inspire, reflecting his belief in the power of music to bring people together and spread positivity in the world.
    

            “It’s saying that we are living for each other; we are a chain,” the musician explained. “We need that respect and love within each other to uplift each other.”

CNN_31,What we know about the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/what-we-know-iran-haniyeh-assassination-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 16:19:00,world,"
            The assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran has rocked the Middle East – threatening to further destabilize the region and jeopardize ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the war in Gaza.
    

            The attack on Haniyeh came in the early hours of Wednesday morning, with Hamas pointing the finger at Israel – which has so far declined to comment.
    

            All eyes will now focus on two key questions. What happens to Gaza hostage and ceasefire negotiations, given Haniyeh headed up the group’s political operations from overseas and acted as a key interlocuter with international mediators? And will this strike inside Iran prove to be the catalyst for a potential full-blown regional war?
    

            Here’s what we know so far.
    

            Haniyeh had been in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and was staying in a residence for veterans in the north of the city, state-affiliated news outlet Fars reported.
    

            At around 2 a.m. local time, an “airborne guided projectile” targeted where Haniyeh was staying, according to Iranian state-run outlet IRNA which said his bodyguard was also killed.
    

            IRNA said further investigations are underway to determine the details of the operation and the position from where the projectile was fired.
    

            Shortly afterward, Hamas decried what it called a “Zionist strike” and a “grave escalation” in its decades long conflict with Israel.
    

            One Hamas official said the group is “ready to pay various prices” and that the “moment of truth has come,” adding: “This assassination will not achieve the goals of the occupation and will not push Hamas to surrender.”
    

            When asked for comment, Israel’s military said it “doesn’t respond to reports in the foreign media.”
    

            The 62-year-old had been part of Hamas for decades, becoming political chief of the group in 2017. The following year, he was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the United States.
    

            Despite that designation – and unlike Hamas’ military leadership – Haniyeh travelled globally, meeting with world figures as the political head of the organization.
    

            During the war with Israel in Gaza he has taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.
    

            Earlier this spring, he said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.”
    

            Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July. Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement.
    

            Haniyeh’s death “will have significant influence on those negotiations,” said CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid on Wednesday.
    

            Leaders from around the region have weighed in, with some condemning the killing and voicing alarm about the potential fallout.
    

            Palestinian leaders, including the Palestinian president and prime minister – who come from factions that have deep historical rivalries with Hamas – have condemned the killing and called for Palestinian “national unity.”
    

            The White House has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s killing, a spokesperson said, but declined to immediately comment further. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but that the US would help defend Israel if it were attacked.
    

            Leaders from Russia and Turkey have both decried the assassination, warning it would lead to larger conflicts in the region.
    

            Other Iran-backed militant groups have also voiced sympathy – including Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.
    

            News of Haniyeh’s killing came just hours after Israel said it had killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr, in a drone strike in Beirut, Lebanon.

Israel says its Beirut strike killed Hezbollah’s top military commander, who it blames for Golan Heights attack


            The group has not confirmed Shukr’s death, but said on Wednesday he “was present” at the time of the strike.
    

            If true, Shukr would be the most high-ranking Hezbollah official to have been assassinated since 2016 when Mustafa Badreddine, the group’s top commander at the time, was killed in Syria.
    

            Whatever the fate of Shukr, Wednesday’s strike marked the most serious Israeli escalation since confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel began on October 8.

CNN_33,"A tragic accident robbed Xander Schauffele’s father of his Olympic dream. Now, golf’s golden boy is out to honor him again",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/xander-schauffele-paris-olympics-father-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-31 16:17:00,world,"
            Sixty-three days. That’s all it took for Xander Schauffele’s life and legacy to change forever. Yet the origins of the golfer’s golden summer stretch back almost four decades – seven years before he was born – to one fateful road in Germany.
    

            Long-tarred with the backhanded label of ‘the most talented golfer never to win a major,’ the American shredded that tag with a vengeance, scooping both the PGA Championship and The Open Championship in a stunning two-month stretch.
    

            Before that, the 30-year-old’s most prestigious prize was an Olympic gold medal, clinched in Japan in 2021. On Thursday, he will tee off in Paris as the defending champion, but also as a son.
    

            Because his father, Stefan Schauffele, never got his shot at The Games. Those dreams of representing Germany in the decathlon were shattered in 1986 when, en route to the national training facility in Stuttgart, the 23-year-old was struck by a drunk driver.
    

            “Hit him pretty much head on,” world No. 2 Schauffele told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell.
    

            “Went completely blind in his left eye. He was in and out of hospital for two years.”
    

            By the time those check-ins finally stopped, Seoul 1988 had come and gone, and with it – given the severity of his injuries – any hopes of an Olympic appearance.
    

            Yet fate can have a strange way of fulfilling itself. Hospital doctors introduced Schauffele to golf, a sport that he would then pass on to his son after moving to San Diego, California. The talent quickly became obvious and the 6-foot-3-inch Schauffele senior – fondly nicknamed ‘The Ogre’ – was soon working as his own child’s swing coach.
    

            The rest, as they say, is history. Some 38 years after his Olympic dream vanished, Stefan Schauffele went to sleep with a gold medal in bed beside him.


            “All his wisdom … it derives from his training when he wanted to become an Olympian,” Schauffele explained.
    

            “Everything that he’s been through in his life, that trauma that he’s experienced … My dad didn’t want me to feel the trauma but made me realize what the other side looks like as much as he could, just so I’d be more appreciative of what I have and what I’m able to do.”
    

            After Schauffele began working closely with renowned trainer Chris Como last year, his father is no longer his only swing coach, but endures as a key pillar of emotional support in the golfer’s “concrete foundation” – the family, friends and staff that form his tight-knit team.
    

            The nine-time PGA Tour winner had powered to both his major crowns with barely a flicker of emotion, neither a nerve-wracking closing shootout at Valhalla in Kentucky nor brutal wind and rain in Scotland breaking his steely-eyed mask.
    

            His father, however, was far easier to read. Having watched his son lift his first major through watery eyes on a TV screen in Hawaii, where he was overseeing a family construction project, he was among the first to embrace his son behind the 18th green at Royal Troon – lips quivering long before he hugged the new champion.
    

            “He was a mess, he was crying like a little baby,” Schauffele recalled.
    

            “After Valhalla, I Facetimed him and he was in the same position, crying his eyes out. He’s over the moon, everyone’s just reaching out to him and congratulating him. It’s something we’ve both dreamed of, so to share it is a really special thing.”
    

            In true Open champion custom, Schauffele has since sent red wine cascading into the Claret Jug, followed by – against his father’s orders – some hard liquor.
    

            Yet celebrations befitting of his double major haul will have to be put on ice for another week at least, with the men’s individual golf event beginning at Le Golf National from 9 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) on Thursday.
    

            Victory would make Schauffele the first golfer ever to win two gold medals, albeit with the caveat that the sport took a 112-year hiatus from the Games until Rio 2016. To do so, he will have to topple a plethora of the game’s biggest stars, including Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and his own compatriot, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, on a course he’s never played before.
    

            Then again, he’s bested that trio and many more twice on the biggest stage already this year. Brimming with the most self-belief he’s “ever” had, Schauffele fancies his chances.
    

            “I think my advantage is if I can be in the hunt on that last round,” he said.
    

            “If I’m on the back nine in a good position, I think I can really use the previous win of the gold medal or even my earlier major this year to propel me forward in the moment because I know I’ve done it before.”
    

            The question is, now that he’s experienced both, where does Olympic glory rank next to major success?
    

            “It’s hard to put them up next to each other because they’re so unique and different to me,” Schauffele said.
    

            “One of them is something I’ve really dreamed of with the majors, and then the other one is so close to home, so close to the heart for me. It’s like a bond with my Dad and I have had him being my coach almost my entire life. So it’s really hard for me to scale.”

CNN_34,Olympic triathlon goes ahead after officials give the green light over Seine water quality,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/triathlon-seine-water-green-light-spt/index.html,2024-07-31 16:05:00,world,"
            The triathlon competitions are up and running in Paris on Wednesday after concerns over water quality in the River Seine caused the men’s race to be postponed a day earlier.


            More rain came into Paris overnight but World Triathlon and Paris 2024 determined the water quality was sufficient to move ahead for both the women’s and men’s races.
    

            “Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3:30 a.m. attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, Météo France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the Île-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women’s and the men’s triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. respectively,” Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a joint statement.
    

            The women’s race had been marked by bike crashes on the wet streets of Paris. In the cycling portion of the race, several athletes fell after slipping on the slippery roads. Vittoria Lopes of Brazil was among the leaders when she fell but fell out of contention.
    

            France’s Cassandre Beaugrand eventually was crowned women’s triathlon Olympic champion on home soil, roared across the finish line by a boisterous French crowd that broke out into a rendition ‘La Marseillaise.’
    

            The men’s race is set to begin at 4:45 a.m. ET.
    

            Heavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday’s opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.
    

            Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday’s race would go ahead as planned.
    

            The decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.
    

            About $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river’s water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.
    

One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin – called the Austerlitz basin – which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.
    

            Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.
    

            But the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 – following rain the previous day – E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.
    

            That’s double the level needed for “good” water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.
    

            For much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization’s medical committee decides the race can go ahead.
    

            The individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-Élysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.
    

            A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.

CNN_35,The internet is in love with South Korea’s record-breaking Olympic shooter,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/style/kim-yeji-pistol-shooter-paris-olympics-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 17:42:00,world,"
            She’s impossibly cool, casually breaks world records and is the internet’s latest darling. And while her cap and futuristic glasses are merely functional accoutrements in the world of competitive shooting, they wouldn’t look out of place on a street style-inspired runway.
    

            She’s Kim Yeji, the 31-year-old South Korean sharpshooter who has taken social media by storm following her appearance at the Paris Olympics.
    

            Kim won silver at the 10-meter air pistol event on Sunday, with her 19-year-old teammate Oh Ye Jin taking the gold.
    

            But it was an older video of Kim competing in Azerbaijan in May that went viral on X, formerly Twitter, gaining more than 7 million views and a horde of new fans in just a few days.
    

            In the video, Kim wears a backwards cap over her blunt bob, her steely gaze fixed on the target through a pair of shooting glasses — a piece of specialist eyewear that helps athletes focus on the target but also looks like something out of a science-fiction movie.
    

            Her arm extended and head tilted down, she fires and barely reacts as it emerges she has set a new world record. She flips up her glasses’ lens to stare directly at the camera before glancing impassively at the nearby screen.
    

            Images from her Sunday performance also circulated widely online, with people complimenting not only her unflinching expression but also her black Fila jacket, Sauer shooting shoes and the stuffed toy elephant that hung from her pocket as she competed.
    

            A photo showing Kim leaning back with one hand resting nonchalantly on her hip and the other holding a pistol, her ponytail flicking out from the back of her cap, was shared by the X account Women Posting W’s with the caption “the most aura I have ever seen in an image.” It has since been liked over 300,000 times.
    

            Other posts on X, each boasting hundreds of thousands of likes, applauded her “main character energy” and declared her “mother,” the ultimate stamp of approval in Internet-speak. The platform’s owner, Elon Musk, meanwhile commented that Kim “should be cast in an action movie.”
    

            Kim, a first-time Olympian, will next compete at the qualifying round of the 25-meter pistol event on Friday.
    

            Kim and Oh’s podium finish reflects South Korea’s strength in shooting, with the country taking home medals in the event at every edition of the Summer Olympic Games since 2000.
    

            Kim and Oh are roommates in the Olympic Village, according to the Associated Press, with Kim saying Oh was like a sister to her.
    

            “I always want to care for her and always be there for her. So when she won the gold medal, I was extra happy,” she told the news agency ahead of Sunday’s event.
    

            “I do not view her as my rival. This is a big stage, the Olympics, and we won the gold and silver. When we won these medals, we were so proud we are Koreans.”

CNN_36,Kari Lake wins GOP Senate primary in Arizona to take on Ruben Gallego in pivotal contest,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/arizona-election-results-kari-lake-gallego/index.html,2024-07-31 18:14:00,politics,"
            Arizona Republican Kari Lake won her Senate primary Tuesday to face off against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in one of this fall’s most important races in the battle for control of the chamber.
    

            The two are competing for the seat of retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.
    

            Lake, who had the endorsement of the Senate Republican campaign arm, is projected to defeat Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and neuroscientist Elizabeth Reye. Lamb had just over 40% of the Republican primary vote Tuesday night – a potential warning sign for Lake as she heads into the general election needing to consolidate the GOP base and reach out to independent voters. Gallego faced no opposition for the Democratic nomination Tuesday.
    

            Lake, a former local news anchor who lost the 2022 governor’s race in her first bid for political office, is a strident ally of former President Donald Trump. She is best known nationally for pushing lies about widespread election fraud – backing an audit of the 2020 presidential race and fighting in court to overturn her 2022 loss to Democrat Katie Hobbs.
    

            Gallego, a retired Marine who represents a deep-blue Phoenix-area seat, launched his campaign in early 2023, long before Sinema announced her retirement. Sinema was elected to the seat in 2018 as a Democrat – the first from the party to win a Senate contest in Arizona in 30 years.
    

            This year’s Senate race, like many others across the political map, has been shaken up by President Joe Biden’s late decision to forgo reelection and Vice President Kamala Harris’ emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republicans have focused their attacks on Harris over her handling of border security – an issue especially important in Arizona. However, polls have shown Harris with stronger appeal than Biden among young and non-White voters, which could help Gallego in the fast-growing Sun Belt state.
    

            Many GOP donors and strategists have expressed doubts over Lake’s chances of winning this fall, citing her feuds with fellow Republicans, including the family of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, and her refusal to accept past election results. A recent Times (UK)/SAY24/YouGov poll found Gallego leading Lake 48% to 41% among registered Arizona voters. But if Trump does well enough in Arizona, he might be able to carry Lake to victory with him.
    

            Gallego, a onetime member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has sought to define himself as a moderate through his early television ads, touting his military service and efforts to lower costs for families.
    

            Gallego enters the general election with a financial edge over Lake. He reported $8.2 million in his campaign coffers on July 10 compared with his opponent’s $2.1 million.

            Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, according to the Palestinian militant group and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps. Hamas accused Israel of assassinating Haniyeh in a strike on his residence following his participation in Tuesday’s inauguration of Iran’s new president. The killing has deepened fears of an all-out war in the Middle East as Hamas continues to battle Israeli forces in Gaza and as tensions rise between Israel and Hezbollah. Israel’s military declined to comment on the death of Haniyeh, although senior officials have vowed to eliminate Hamas in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris went on the offensive on immigration at her rally in Atlanta Tuesday, attempting to counter former President Donald Trump’s attacks on the issue. She touted her role as a California attorney general who prosecuted transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers — then blamed Trump for “tanking” the bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory. Meanwhile, the Trump team recently released two campaign ads taking direct aim at Harris’ immigration portfolio and falsely casting her as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” Biden administration officials have repeatedly maintained that Harris focused on long-term fixes, while the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
    

            The CDC announced a $5 million initiative to offer seasonal flu vaccines to farmworkers to prevent a supercharged flu virus. Public health officials across the US share concerns that a new version of the influenza virus could emerge among livestock workers who are at a higher risk of catching the bird flu virus, which has been circulating in millions of farmed and wild animals. Under the new initiative, the seasonal flu vaccine will not be mandatory for farmworkers but will be brought to local events and to areas where they typically gather. The general public’s risk from bird flu remains low, according to the CDC, but there is still a real risk for animals, with outbreaks detected in commercial poultry, backyard flocks and even pets.
    

            The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation aimed at protecting minors online as many lawmakers and parents criticize the effects of social media use on children. The legislative package is made up of a pair of key bills that require enhanced safeguards for children, including restricting access to minors’ personal data and providing parents with supervision tools in some cases. The package proposes a limit on features that encourage children and teens to stay on social platforms longer. It also calls on platforms to prohibit ads shown to minors that include narcotic drugs, tobacco products, gambling or alcohol. It’s not yet clear if the legislation will be taken up in the House, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has signaled openness to the measure.

CNN_38,This island paradise only gets a few thousand visitors a year. It just scored a huge international recognition,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/travel/marquesas-islands-french-polynesia-unesco-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 18:59:00,world,"
            The Marquesas are a beautiful, remote stretch of islands in the South Pacific.
    

            And, as of last weekend, they are also a UNESCO World Heritage site.
    

            The latest UNESCO convention added 24 new properties to its famed list this year, including sites connected to the legacy of Nelson Mandela in South Africa, a rainforest rock cave complex in Malaysia and the ruins of a Swahili city in Kenya.
    

            But few travelers have had the opportunity to experience Te Henua Enata (The Land of Men).
    

            Comprised of 12 islands, half of which are populated, this French Polynesian region is home to about 9,000 people. The most populous of those is Nuku Hiva, which CNN Travel explored in 2021.
    

            To find them on a map, look about 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) southeast of Hawaii and 4,700 kilometers (2,920 miles) east of Fiji.
    

            Because of its remote location, French Polynesia – which includes Bora Bora and Tahiti – received about 220,000 foreign tourists in 2022. And even fewer of those tourists made it to the Marquesas.
    

            According to data from the Institute of Statistics for French Polynesia (ISFP), 10,995 tourists visited the Marquesas in 2023. That is less than 2% of the total number of travelers to Tahiti. Two-thirds of them are French, which makes sense considering that the region is an overseas department of France.

Nuku Hiva: This paradise island is one of the remotest places on the planet


            The US is the second-biggest group of travelers to the islands, followed by China, Canada, Germany and the UK.
    

            Most tourists arrive via Fa’a’ā International Airport in Tahiti, then come by boat to Nuku Hiva and the other Marquesan islands. The boat, the Aranui 5, is a dual-purpose vessel that brings people (about 230 of them, on average) and freight on 12-day cruises from Papeete, which is the capital of French Polynesia.
    

            The Marquesas’ tourism industry is also managed out of Tahiti.
    

            “This inscription is a unique opportunity to showcase the exceptional cultural and environmental heritage of the Marquesas Archipelago internationally,” Tahiti Tourism CEO Jean-Marc Mocellin said in a statement, adding that the UNESCO designation “will reinforce the positioning of the islands of Tahiti as an inclusive and sustainable tourism destination.”
    

            In addition to its stunning geography, UNESCO recognized the Marquesas’ unique culture and heritage. The remote location and lack of human interference contribute to the waters around the islands being “among the world’s last marine wilderness areas.” It’s not unusual to see spinner dolphins doing acrobatics just offshore.
    

            Marquesan wood carving, dance and music form part of the islands’ heritage. Painter Paul Gaugin, who is best known for his paintings of Tahiti, and Belgian singer Jacques Brel are both buried in a small cemetery on the island of Hiva Oa.

            Team GB’s Alex Yee produced a sensational finish to take the lead of the men’s triathlon on the final bend and snatch the gold medal away from New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde. Wilde had opened up a 15-second lead during the run, the third and final portion of the race, but Yee hunted him down spectacularly over the last 1.5 kilometers.

Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization’s medical committee decides the race can go ahead.
    

            The individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-Élysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.
    

            A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.

CNN_40,First on CNN: Cyberattack hits blood-donation nonprofit OneBlood,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/cyberattack-oneblood-blood-donation/index.html,2024-07-31 19:28:00,politics,"
            A cyberattack has hit a blood-donation nonprofit that serves hundreds of hospitals in the southeastern US, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    

            The hack has raised concerns about potential impacts on OneBlood’s service to some hospitals, the sources said, and the incident is being investigated as a potential ransomware attack.
    

            An “outage” of OneBlood’s software system is impacting the nonprofit’s ability to ship “blood products” to hospitals in Florida, according to an advisory sent to health care providers by the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cyberthreat-sharing group, and reviewed by CNN. OneBlood has been manually labeling blood products as the nonprofit recovers from the incident, the advisory said.
    

            OneBlood did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. The nonprofit serves more than 300 hospitals in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina, according to its website.

CNN_41,Boeing names new CEO after losses more than triple,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/investing/boeings-losses-new-ceo/index.html,2024-07-31 19:52:00,us,"
            Boeing named a new CEO after it reported a core operating loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter – more than triple the loss from a year ago – as increased scrutiny of the safety and quality of its planes kept the troubled company from making enough aircraft to return to profitability.
    

            Boeing announced Robert K. “Kelly” Ortberg, the former CEO of supplier Rockwell Collins, will be its new CEO, effective August 8, replacing retiring Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun, who has been under fire for the company’s problems. Ortberg has a background as an engineer, not in finance, having earned his college degree in mechanical engineering.
    

            “I’m extremely honored and humbled to join this iconic company,” said Ortberg in a statement from the company. “Boeing has a tremendous and rich history as a leader and pioneer in our industry, and I’m committed to working together with the more than 170,000 dedicated employees of the company to continue that tradition, with safety and quality at the forefront.”
    

            Ortberg, who noted “there is much work to be done” at Boeing, has a background that could be encouraging to some staff who have criticized Boeing’s management for having too much of a emphasis on finance rather than the engineering quality.
    

            But Ortberg’s appointment doesn’t necessarily guarantee the right decisions will be made by the company’s new leadership. While Calhoun’s background is in finance, his predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing at the time of the development of the troubled 737 Max jet and the two fatal crashes of the plane that led to its 20-month grounding and five years of financial losses, also had an engineering background.

CNN_42,Ex-BBC presenter Huw Edwards pleads guilty to having indecent images of children,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/media/huw-edwards-guilty-indecent-images-intl-gbr/index.html,2024-07-31 19:34:00,us,"
            Former BBC presenter Huw Edwards has pleaded guilty to having 41 indecent images of children on the messaging app WhatsApp, according to PA Media.
    

            Edwards appeared before London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday, with PA reporting that the alleged offenses were committed between December 2020 and August 2021.
    

            The court heard that Edwards engaged in online chat with an adult man on WhatsApp who sent him 377 sexual images, 41 of which were indecent images of children. All charges were in relation to images of children under the age of 18.
    

            The veteran journalist arrived at court wearing a dark suit, blue tie and sunglasses. The 62-year-old entered his pleas at the start of the hearing, and “stared into the distance” as the prosecutor laid out the case against him.
    

            The court heard that seven of the illegal images were classified as category A, the most severe classification of indecent images of children under English law. Twelve of the images were category B and a further 22 images were category C.
    

            The court heard that Edwards told a man on WhatsApp not to send him underage images after the man asked if the images he was sending were too young. The final indecent image was sent in August 2021, involving a category A video of a young boy.
    

            No more illegal images were sent after that message, the court heard, but the pair were said to continue exchanging legal pornographic images until April 2022.
    

            Speaking in Edwards’ defense, his barrister Philip Evans said, “there’s no suggestion in this case that Mr Edwards has… in the traditional sense of the word, created any image of any sort.”
    

            “Mr. Edwards did not keep any images, did not send any to anyone else and did not and has not sought similar images from anywhere else,” Evans said.
    

            On Monday, London’s Metropolitan Police said it had charged Edwards last month. He was arrested in November last year, police revealed.
    

            The Metropolitan Police previously outlined the allegations “did not form part of the matter which was considered by police in July 2023. They were investigated separately as a standalone case.”
    

            Edwards was known for presenting the BBC’s flagship News at Ten program — equivalent to the anchor of a network evening news program in the US. He had also been the BBC’s anchor for coverage of major state events such as royal weddings and funerals.
    

            He stepped down from his role at the BBC in late April after a 40-year career, during which he became one of the most recognized faces in British television news.
    

            The BBC’s annual report, published last week, revealed that Edwards was paid between £475,000 ($610,000) and £479,999 ($616,000) in the period from April 2023 to March 2024. He was the BBC’s third highest-paid employee in that time.

CNN_43,"Hamas political leader Haniyeh assassinated in Iran, plunging Middle East conflict into dangerous new phase",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-31 19:04:00,world,"
            Hamas said its political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in an overnight strike in the Iranian capital Tehran, a major development that throws the war between Israel and the militant group into an unpredictable and dangerous new phase.
    

            Haniyeh’s death is, both strategically and symbolically, a dramatic blow to Hamas, eliminating its most public figure who headed up the group’s political operations while living overseas.
    

            He is the second leader of an Iran-backed group reported to have been assassinated in the last day, following the killing of Hezbollah’s most senior military commander in Lebanon.
    

            In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of targeting Haniyeh and his bodyguard in a “strike” on the building in which he was staying in Tehran, where he had participated in Tuesday’s inauguration of the new Iranian president. Hamas officials said Haniyeh’s death would “not pass in vain” and described the killing as a “grave escalation,” while Iran’s Supreme Leader said it is “our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.”
    

            Iranian state run media IRNA said the strike happened at around 2 a.m. local time (6:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday), involving an “airborne guided projectile.” Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was sworn in on Tuesday and Hamas released pictures the same day of Haniyeh meeting Iranian officials in Tehran. State-affiliated Fars said Haniyeh was staying in a residence in north Tehran.
    

            Israel’s military said it does not respond to reports in foreign media, though senior officials have previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leadership in response to the group’s October 7 attack on Israel. It later said it was “conducting a situational assessment.”
    

            In contrast, Israel did confirm it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed Hezbollah commander Fu’ad Shukr, whom it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Shukr’s assassination was the most serious Israeli escalation in its confrontation with the powerful Lebanese militant group since it restarted in earnest last October.
    

            Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, launched following the attacks led by the militant group on October 7, has sparked increasingly intense, near-daily ripples of conflict throughout the region. This week’s dual strikes, which came within several hours of each other, seemingly escalates that discord on multiple fronts, and will prompt renewed fears of an all-out war breaking out in the Middle East.
    

            It may also dash any remaining hopes of a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza being reached in the near future, amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the enclave. Haniyeh had played a leading role representing Hamas in months-long truce negotiations, which have repeatedly appeared to reach the cusp of a breakthrough, only to collapse at the last moment.
    

            Haniyeh is the second Hamas senior leader to be killed since the war in Gaza began. In January, the group said the deputy head of its political bureau, Saleh Al Arouri, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Arouri was considered one of the founding members of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.
    

            The impact of any single death in Hamas’ leadership structure is difficult to predict given the group’s vast and opaque network, and it has been able to weather the death of other key leaders before – including the slaying of its co-founders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi, killed weeks apart in 2004.
    

            But Haniyeh’s death leaves Hamas without its public political figurehead, and likely represents a major setback to its international operations. It would not be expected to dramatically impact its military effort, but his demise may carry symbolic weight throughout the organization.

Netanyahu reverses on key Israeli concession in ceasefire talks


            He had taken a central role in hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, and earlier this spring said Hamas was willing to strike a deal – but added it would require Israel withdrawing from Gaza and a guarantee to cease fighting in the enclave permanently, demands that Israel has called “unacceptable.”
    

            A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN on Wednesday that Haniyeh’s death could “complicate mediation talks.”
    

            The source said Haniyeh – along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar – was a “key decision maker.”
    

            “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source added.
    

            Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt as recently as early July. Those talks now hang in the balance, despite some hope earlier this month that they were nearing a framework agreement.
    

            “How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?” Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a mediator in the talks, posted on X on Wednesday. Qatar’s capital, Doha, also hosts the main Hamas political bureau. “Peace needs serious partners & a global stance against the disregard for human life,” Al-Thani wrote.
    

            The killings of Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah’s Shukr in Beirut are significant in both their timing and location.
    

            Brigadier General (Res.) Assaf Orion, senior researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies think tank, said the two deaths “increase the likelihood of an axis response, adding Iran and other proxy attacks to the menu.”
    

            Iran has spent years investing in regional proxy groups, informally known as the “Axis of Resistance” – an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance – supplying them with money, weapons, and training as Tehran has sought to broaden its influence across the Middle East.
    

            Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran sees it as its duty to avenge the killing of Haniyeh because he was assassinated on Iranian soil.

            “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Khamenei said in a statement referring to Israel. “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.”
    

            Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has brought that longstanding shadow war with Iran out into the open – and inflamed opinion globally.
    

            The White House said it has seen the reports of Haniyeh’s death but declined to immediately comment further, according to a spokesperson. While traveling in the Philippines, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he does not think war in the Middle East is inevitable, but if Israel were to be attacked the United States would help defend it.
    

            The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite wing of the Iranian military, said Haniyeh’s death was under investigation and results will be announced later Wednesday, according to Iranian state media.
    

            And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned Haniyeh’s killing calling it “a cowardly act and a dangerous development,” according to the WAFA news agency on Wednesday. “His Excellency called on the masses and forces of our people to unite, be patient and steadfast in the face of the Israeli occupation,” WAFA reported.
    

            Haniyeh, 62, was born in a refugee camp near Gaza City, and joined Hamas in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, or uprising.
    

            As Hamas grew in power, Haniyeh rose through the ranks – being appointed part of a secret “collective leadership” in 2004. By 2017 he had become chief of the group – and was named a “specially designated global terrorist” by the US soon after.
    

            Over the years, he has participated in peace talks with former US President Jimmy Carter, and met with other world leaders including the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, and Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian earlier this year.
    

            In April, Israeli air strikes killed three of Haniyeh’s sons and four of his grandchildren, according to Hamas.
    

            At the time, Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks. “Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands, is delusional,” he said.

CNN_44,Iran has no good options after two deadly strikes on senior allies,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/analysis-iran-options-ismail-haniyeh-killing-intl/index.html,2024-07-31 20:06:00,world,"
            One of the few things working in Iran’s favor after the humiliating news that Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital overnight is that the regime controls most of the information the world gets to see.
    

            What Iran has said so far is that Haniyeh died after being hit by an “airborne guided projectile” in Tehran where he was attending the inauguration of the Iranian president. But we know little else. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the strike but has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas and its leaders following the October 7 attacks.
    

            Haniyeh’s death came hours after Israel confirmed it carried out a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that killed the most senior military commander of Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed militant group, who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
    

            The precise details of what happened at around 2 a.m. (5.30 p.m. ET) in Tehran, will dictate what comes next, as Iran looks to present a narrative that justifies and fashions its response.
    

            Whatever the truth and whatever Iran proffers, the attack is clearly a grave violation of its sovereignty and the supposed security bubble of the Iranian capital. Haniyeh was the regime’s guest, and its role as a regional power is compromised if it’s unable to guarantee the simple safety of visiting allies.
    

            There are reports he was staying in a guest house for veterans, and it is unclear whose technical responsibility it was to protect this facility – and whether the elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) will be explicitly embarrassed, outside of the wider humiliation of an apparent Israeli assassination deep inside of Iran.
    

            But Iran has stomached comparable violations in the past. The death of its leading nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was met with limited wrath in 2020. The killing of Quds commander Qasem Suleinami, the country’s most fabled military figure, months earlier, led to fiery rhetoric, but instead a limited hit on a remote US base. Iran has stepped back before – and may do so again.
    

            There is no shortage of furious rherotic the day after the strikes, but there is no easy route for Iran. It is clear Tehran has been reluctant, for the months since October 7, to launch its most ferocious proxy, Hezbollah, into a full-scale war with Israel from Lebanon. Putting aside the huge humanitarian horror such a conflict would muster for Lebanese and Israelis alike, Hezbollah remains a powerful card that Tehran gets to play probably once. The regime retains apparent ambitions in its nuclear program and a military eroded by sanctions, so Hezbollah is an ace that must be tabled with astute timing.
    

            Iran has also tried an unprecedented direct all-out attack on Israel before, in April, after senior IRGC commanders were killed in an Israeli strike on Damascus. In short, the 300 drone and missiles fired - straight from Iran at Israel - just didn’t get through. Around 99% of them were intercepted.
    

            The regime’s response to Haniyeh’s death will define its role as a regional power, and, if it fails to appear potent enough, risks that slipping. A stealthy, asymmetric strike, weeks from now, may not fix the damage done to its prestige.
    

            The risk of the unchartered territory we are in is that the gravity of expected responses is not defined – the tit for tat is occurring in an environment evolving by the day. Indeed, the characters making the decisions are changing rapidly, or under intense domestic pressure themselves. This simply accentuates the risk of miscalculation, or of actions taken to satisfy selfish, insular concerns, rather than a wider regional impact. In short, it is a mess that grows, and with it surges the chance of the unexpected.
    

            Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s first statement on the matter said of Israel, “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment.” But remember this is a superannuated, octogenarian leader who has just endured years of popular unrest and rising conflict with Israel, and 24 hours ago saw a surprisingly moderate president, Masoud Pezeshkian, get sworn in. He is projecting strength internally as much as he is internationally.
    

            Separately, Hezbollah had stumbled it seemed into an acute crisis though the militant group’s apparently mistaken targeting of Druze schoolchildren in the Golan Heights at the weekend. It may feel the strike on Haniyeh has removed the spotlight to respond, for the shortest while, although it may be dragged into Iran’s eventual response. But the fact the assassination of its commander, Fuad Shukr, now seems like a distant memory, exposing how rapidly events are unfolding.
    

            Tehran is taking its time to reveal how, yet again, its innermost sanctum was violated by Israel. The IRGC trailed a statement about Haniyeh at 2.50 a.m. US time, but it eventually avoided most details of how he was killed. Perhaps it doesn’t know, or doesn’t want to say, or is working out what to say in order to find a response that fits – and that it can execute.
    

            Still, red lines have been criss-crossed for months, and this morning we lept a few rungs higher up the ladder of escalation. The agonizing question of the next 24 hours - as Iran fashions its narrative of how this major humiliation came to be - is what remaining steps are there on this well-trodden ladder, and what is at its peak?

Simone Biles has seemingly clapped back at criticism from former teammate MyKayla Skinner following the US gymnastics team’s victory at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday.

            The Instagram post appears to be a response to controversial comments from Skinner, 27, who criticized the Team USA gymnasts in a YouTube video following the team selection on June 30.
    

            “Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t like what it used to be,” she said in the video, which has since been deleted.

            “A lot of girls don’t work as hard,” she added. “The girls just don’t have the work ethic.”
    

            Biles appeared to respond in a post on Threads which read “not everyone needs a mic and a platform.”
    

            Skinner then posted a video defending her comments on Instagram Stories, claiming that she had been “misinterpreted or misunderstood.”
    

            However, she later apologized in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, amid an online backlash.
    

            “It was not my intention to offend of disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work,” she wrote.
    

            “I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologize.”

            After winning the team gold on Tuesday, Biles now holds the most Olympic medals of any US gymnast in history, adding to her title as the most decorated gymnast of all time.

CNN_46,San Francisco will enforce penalties to clear homeless encampments as Los Angeles pushes back on governor’s order,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/30/us/san-francisco-homeless-encampments-penalties/index.html,2024-07-31 21:14:00,us,"
            As the city of San Francisco prepares to fall in line with California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to clear homeless encampments, Los Angeles is pushing back, refusing to allow its jails to be used to hold those removed from encampments.
    

            Newsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation’s largest homeless population, issued a directive last week ordering state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property and encouraging local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state’s. His order followed a US Supreme Court decision that upheld an Oregon city’s homeless policy.
    

            In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed will proceed with her administration’s plans to implement “progressive penalties,” or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release – a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.
    

            “Warnings will be followed by citations,” the release said. “In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.”
    

            But officials in Los Angeles have made clear they won’t be heeding the governor’s encouragement to follow suit.
    

            The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday in support of a motion affirming its jails won’t be used to hold homeless people arrested when encampments are broken up, The Los Angeles Times reported. County officials have said the approach is already in effect.
    

            “We’re not going to go to a race to the bottom,” County Supervisor Hilda Solis said, according to the Times. “We’re not going to turn our backs. We’re not going to use our jails to somehow incarcerate and criminalize people who are on the street.”
    

            Supervisor Lindsey Horvath noted someone who is endangering public safety or committing other crimes at an encampment could still be arrested and jailed, the Los Angeles Times reported.
    

            “We aren’t saying that if there’s violent crime happening at a homeless encampment that that is not an arrestable offense,” Horvath said. “We aren’t saying anything like that at all. In fact, what we’re being clear about is that we are not criminalizing poverty or homelessness.”
    

            Late last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority’s point-in-time count – conducted in January – showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county. There were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.
    

            Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass last week said that the city would focus on “a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization.”
    

            “Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,” she said.
    

            The differing approaches from two of California’s largest cities comes after the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution’s ban on “cruel and unusual” punishment.

What we know about the governor’s order to clear homeless encampments in California


            “There are simply no more excuses. It’s time for everyone to do their part,” Newsom said last week, directing state agencies to “adopt humane and dignified policies” and “move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.”
    

            Homeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown – without providing adequate shelter and other services – would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.
    

            “Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,” said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of “criminalizing poverty” and “doubling down on failed policies.”
    

            The 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco’s “progressive penalties” plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor’s office said the court has “officially modified” the injunction against the city “to be in line” with the US Supreme Court ruling.
    

            In laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by “offering shelter and services to those on the street.” The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to “address smaller encampments on a daily basis” to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.
    

            California has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    

Newsom’s order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt “policies and plans consistent” with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.
    

            The department provides “advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site” for at least 60 days, Newsom’s office said.
    

            Breed, San Francisco’s mayor, is running for re-election and tackling homelessness has become a key issue. A shelter waiting list, operated by the city’s Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, showed 138 people were in line for shelter Tuesday evening.
    

            The city government’s most recent count showed 4,354 homeless people were unsheltered in San Francisco on a night in January.
    

            Breed’s office said “a majority of the times” city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.
    

            Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state’s homeless population.
    

            While some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn’t a place to house them.

What Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order to clear homeless encampments means for the people who live in them


            “It’s very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that’s been tossed around for years,” Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have “nowhere to go.”
    

            “What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately – immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,” Friedenbach continued.
    

            Under the mayor’s new rules, teams from San Francisco’s Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.
    

            Researchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said “punitive policing strategies” such as encampment removals “do not reduce or end homelessness.”
    

            “Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people’s eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,” the researchers said.
    

            “Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,” they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.

CNN_47,Russia launches one of war’s biggest drone attacks on Ukraine,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/europe/russia-ukraine-drone-biggest-intl/index.html,2024-07-31 21:36:00,world,"
            Russia has launched one of the largest drone attacks on Ukraine since the war began, mainly targeting overnight the region in and around the capital Kyiv, according to the Ukrainian military, which said all 89 drones fired were shot down.
    

            It marks the largest attack on the capital so far this year, and the seventh time Russia has targeted Kyiv this month, military officials said on Wednesday.
    

            The “massive” attack lasted more than seven hours and the drones came in two waves, Kyiv officials said, adding that “not a single drone reached its target.”
    

            There were no hits to residential or critical infrastructure and no casualties in the Kyiv region, according to regional military head Ruslan Kravchenko. However, 13 houses were damaged and rescuers extinguished one fire caused by the downed drones. “The majority of the UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] debris fell outside of the settlements,” he added.
    

            Dramatic video released by the Ukrainian Air Force shows one drone on fire, falling from the sky and landing in a field — causing a large cloud of smoke but no visible damage.
    

            Russia also attacked the country’s Mykolaiv region with an X-59 guided missile from the airspace of the occupied Kherson region, which Ukraine said it also shot down. However, separate attacks on eastern and southern Ukraine killed at least two people Wednesday morning.
    

            The Kremlin did not comment on the attacks in its regular briefing with reporters on Wednesday.
    

            Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk called the drone barrage targeting Kyiv “one of the most massive attacks by Shahed-131/136” drones, comparing it to the Russian attack on New Year’s Eve in which 90 Shaheds were launched.
    

            “Just like then, today the Ukrainian air defense has withstood and repelled a massive attack by enemy drones,” he said. “Mobile fire groups of all the Ukrainian Defence Forces, tactical aviation of the Air Force and Army Aviation of the Land Forces, anti-aircraft missile units and electronic warfare units of the Air Force were involved in repelling the air attack.”
    

            During another wave of aerial attacks days before the New Year’s Eve holiday, Russia fired an unprecedented number of drones and missiles at targets across Ukraine, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 150 others, according to Ukrainian officials at the time.
    

            Since then, Ukraine has repeatedly pleaded for allies to provide more air defense systems.
    

            “Ukrainians can fully protect their skies from Russian strikes when they have sufficient supplies,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday.
    

            “The same level of defense is needed against Russian missiles and the occupier’s combat aircraft. And this can be achieved. We need sufficiently courageous decisions from our partners — enough air defense systems, enough range,” Zelensky added. “And Ukrainians will do everything correctly and precisely.”
    

            The Biden administration announced on Monday a new lethal aid package for Ukraine totaling about $1.7 billion and largely consisting of missiles and ammunition for missile, artillery and air defense systems that the US has previously provided to Ukraine.
    

            In southern Ukraine, a 68-year-old man in Kherson was killed in a drone strike on Wednesday morning, according to the region’s military head. A 73-year-old woman was also injured in that attack, and elsewhere in the region three people were injured in Russian shelling, the official said.
    

            In the Donetsk region, one resident in the city of Toretsk was killed, and four others were injured in attacks elsewhere.
    

            Ukraine’s Armed Forces said it will “continue to effectively hit important military targets of the Russian occupiers,” claiming that on Tuesday night Ukraine carried out a strike on a weapons and military equipment storage facility near the city of Kursk, Russia.
    

            The governor of Russia’s Kursk region said a fire broke out at a facility there “after an attack by the Ukrainian armed forces.”

CNN_49,‘I realized that this was bigger than basketball’: Former NBA All-Star Luol Deng on the rise of South Sudan’s basketball team,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/luol-deng-south-sudan-basketball-olympics-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-31 21:12:00,world,"
            It was a dream debut on the Olympic basketball stage for the world’s youngest country.
    

            South Sudan’s men’s basketball team defeated Puerto Rico 90-79 in Paris on Sunday in its first ever appearance at the Games, but the result meant more than just picking up two points in Group C. For South Sudan Basketball Federation President Luol Deng, it was the culmination of everything that he and the team had worked so hard to achieve.

            “When the national anthem was sung, you know, it just gave me goosebumps, and I realized that this was bigger than basketball,” Deng told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies. “And you know that the support is going to be there.
    

            “This is really a credit to our fans who supported us from day one. And now, we have such a huge following and huge (fanbase) that we really believe that it’s so inspiring because of the fans. The energy and everything that they’re bringing is inspiring everybody else to pay attention to it.”
    

            Deng is a former two-time NBA All-Star and spent 15 years in the league with the likes of the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers. He was born in Wau, in what is now South Sudan, before the country’s independence. His family was displaced due to the Second Sudanese Civil War, moving to Egypt when Deng was a child before the family was granted political asylum in the UK, arriving in London, England.
    

            He moved to the US at 14 to pursue a basketball career, going on to play college hoops at Duke before being drafted seventh overall by Chicago in 2004. He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London.
    

            After his playing career concluded in 2019, Deng became heavily involved with allowing the country in which he was born to tell its story and be represented on the international stage. He currently serves as an assistant coach to the team alongside his role as president, having previously worked as head coach and player liaison.
    

            South Sudan officially gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world’s newest widely-recognized state. It has since experienced a civil war of its own that officially ended in 2018 and is listed as one of the least developed countries in the world by the United Nations.
    

            Like Deng, several of the players on the Olympic roster are refugees who were forced to leave South Sudan or were born elsewhere after their families had been displaced.
    

            “We didn’t just randomly put a team together. I’ve known a lot of these players since they were so young, and I’ve kept up with a lot of other players that I didn’t know, but they were on my radar,” he told CNN. “And before I took over the president of the federation, I did imagine, ‘What if those guys committed to play for our nation?’ And this is the result because it’s all come together.
    

            “These guys believed that it could happen, and whoever didn’t believe in the beginning,that’s fine. We got them on board with us because of, you know, what we’ve been able to do, and we’re glad to have them.”

            With Deng as the driving force, the team has swiftly made history. It played its first competitive fixture in 2017 and qualified for the World Cup at the first time of asking, finishing 17th out of 32 teams at the tournament in 2023.
    

            As the best-placed African team, South Sudan qualified for Olympics as the continent’s sole representative and continued to show that it’s far from a pushover by taking the historically dominant Team USA to the final buzzer in a warm-up game in London earlier this month.
    

            No one can ever question Deng’s commitment to the project – according to South Sudan head coach Royal Ivey, Deng has been funding the team out of his own pocket for four years.
    

            It all appears to have been worth it, however, with Deng stating his pride at being part of “nation building” and that there is “no better feeling” than wearing a shirt that bears the name of South Sudan, though he wishes that he had gotten the opportunity to actually play for the team.
    

            “For now, the polo is good,” he laughed.
    

            After winning its first game and writing its name into the history books, speculation about how far this team can go has already ramped up, though Deng believes that the group’s main goal has already been achieved.
    

            “We’ve been able to tell a story that’s really unique,” the 39-year-old explained. “We’ve worked very hard to get here. I think that we know that we are playing to show people how good we can be. I think the story itself is out there. People understand it, people know it. They can take it however they want to take it.”
    

            This is not a team that’s here to make up the numbers, though.
    

            “We play to win, we’re not just happy to be here,” said Deng. “We feel like we do belong here, and we’re representing the continent, and we want to represent it the right way. When people watch us play, they understand that, you know, we’re well coached and we have great players.”
    

            Next up for South Sudan in Paris is the tallest of tasks – a rematch against a Team USA that features the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. For the staff and players though, the message has always been the most important thing.
    

            “I think we’ll go out there and make a lot of people proud of how we play.”

CNN_50,Hundreds of homes are evacuated due to wildfire near Denver as California’s Park Fire torches an area larger than Los Angeles,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/wildfires-california-park-colorado-quarry/index.html,2024-07-31 22:13:00,us,"
While California battles the fifth-largest wildfire in state history, a new inferno in Colorado has forced the evacuation of about 600 homes near Denver. Here’s the latest on a barrage of blazes burning in several western states: 


            • Colorado’s Quarry Fire spreads rapidly: Emergency crews raced to evacuate homes southwest of Denver overnight as the Quarry Fire, previously known as the Wildland Fire, threatened several subdivisions, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office. The blaze grew from 50 to 100 acres early Wednesday morning, the sheriff’s office posted on X.

            • California’s Park Fire is bigger than the size of Los Angeles: The weeklong inferno, which started July 24 in Northern California, is now the fifth-largest wildfire in state history. It has swallowed more than 389,000 acres, or 607 square miles, according to Cal Fire. More than 5,700 personnel are battling the blaze, using more than 500 fire engines and 40 helicopters. “This region, both Butte and Tehama (counties) … has had four of the largest 10 fires known in history,” Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See said. As of Wednesday morning, the Park Fire had destroyed at least 227 structures and was 18% contained.
    

            • Newsom declares state of emergency for another wildfire: In Southern California, the Borel Fire has ravaged Kern County and decimated a historic mining community. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited affected communities Tuesday and proclaimed a state of emergency. The governor previously declared a state of emergency for the Park and Gold Complex fires.

            • Suspect accused of starting the Park Fire is charged: Ronnie Dean Stout II, the man suspected of starting the Park Fire, has been charged with arson, according to a felony criminal complaint filed Monday. Authorities said a witness saw him pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment. Stout claims he did not push the car, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told reporters. The suspect didn’t enter a plea during a court appearance Monday and was denied bail. His arraignment was continued to Thursday, Ramsey said, and more charges could be added.
    

            • Resident loses two homes in separate wildfires: Standing in the charred remains of his house, Butte County resident Rick Pero told CNN affiliate KHSL the Park Fire was the second California inferno to destroy his home. After the deadly 2018 Camp Fire obliterated his house, Pero and his wife moved to the Forest Ranch community in Butte County. There, Pero educated his neighbors on defensible space – which he credits for helping save dozens of neighbors’ homes. But the precaution didn’t save his own home, Pero told KHSL: “It was just too much Mother Nature.”

            • Oregon firefighters battle mammoth blaze as temperatures soar: Oregon’s largest wildfire, the Durkee Fire, has charred more than 293,000 acres – with no rainfall in sight. The blaze, which was ignited by lightning near the Oregon-Idaho border on July 17, was 52% contained as of Wednesday morning, according to InciWeb. No rainfall is expected the rest of the week, and temperatures are expected to soar to triple digits by the weekend – potentially impairing firefighting efforts.
    

            • 89 large wildfires are raging in the US: Across the country, 89 major wildfires are burning – scorching a combined 2.1 million acres (and counting), the National Interagency Fire Center said Tuesday. Among them, 31 infernos were spreading in Oregon, 10 in California and 10 in Idaho.
    

            “So far in 2024, 27,982 wildfires have burned 4,247,895 acres,” the fire center said. The amount of land torched so far this year is more than the square mileage of Connecticut.
    

            The agency stressed the need to have firefighters and firefighting resources available for an “initial attack” in areas with a high likelihood of fire breaking out. “The vast majority of fire starts are contained at small sizes within 24 hours of their discovery,” the fire center said.
    

            Gusty winds could further fuel fires this week as the heat is expected to intensify across much of the West through Friday. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, and daily high temperature records could be tied or broken this weekend – especially in the Pacific Northwest.

            Packing up your lives and starting afresh in a new country together is a huge move for many couples.
    

            But Patricia Mahan and Dan Matarazzo, from the US, have opted to do it twice in the past two decades.
    

            The retired pair, who’ve been married for 37 years, left the States for Mexico in 2006, before swapping Mexico for Greece last year.
    

            “There’s some soul searching about what it is you’re looking for in the last third of your life,” says Mahan, a former flamenco dancer and teacher.
    

            “We wanted to move by the sea, for one thing. In an affordable place.”
    

            According to Matarazzo, from New Jersey, “economics” was a major factor in their decision to move to Mexico over 20 years ago.
    

            “We realized how much more economically we could live in Mexico if we found conditions that were going to be comfortable,” he says, adding that they were also influenced by other factors.
    

            “US politics were getting in an area I wasn’t nuts about, and I’ve always wanted to live by the ocean.”
    

            The couple, who were previously based in Tucson, Arizona, bought a property in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and threw themselves into life in the colonial-era city, known for its baroque Spanish architecture.
    

            While they were happy there for many years, the pair say that things changed when the city’s popularity began to grow, bringing “more traffic” and “more air pollution.”

            “After a number of publications in American magazines, its popularity grew so rapidly it lost its small town ambience and became a city overnight, with all the hustle and bustle that goes with it,” says Mahan.
    

            Craving something different once again, Mahan began searching for a destination where they could continue to live by the sea and experience a different culture in “an adventuresome but simple way” once again.
    

            “She kept searching,” says Matarazzo, who previously worked as a massage therapist. “And one day I said to her, ‘Look, you find me a place where our life could be as good, or better than it is here in Mexico, and I’ll go.”
    

            Although they considered different parts of Mexico, spending a year in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Mahan and Matarazzo were tempted by the idea of moving much further afield.
    

            Mahan, who Matarazzo describes as a “tenacious researcher,” soon started looking into potential destinations in Greece, a country they’d visited a number of times, and came across Kritsa, a village in Crete, the largest of the Greek islands.
    

            “We wanted village life, but we needed to be near amenities like state of the art medical facilities, nearby airport, weekly farmers’ markets  and supermarkets and stores of all kinds to furnish our house,” explains Mahan. “Kritsa was that village for us.”
    

            After a little more research, the couple found an affordable property in the area and traveled over to view it in April 2023.
    

            “We came here about a year and a half ago to find this one little house,” says Matarazzo, explaining that while they didn’t end up buying that particular property, they knew almost instantly that they wanted to live in Kritsa.
    

            “It was peaceful and tranquil. We felt at home.”
    

            They went on to purchase a two-bedroom stone house, which had previously been a bakery named Sofia’s, in the village for 137,000 euros (around $148,200.)
    

            “When the villagers couldn’t afford to buy bread, they traded Sofia for other foods,” explains Mahan. “We liked the vibes of the house and felt it maybe had some good ‘yeasty’ karma.”

            In September 2023, the pair left Mexico behind and moved to Crete, entering with Type D Visas, which would permit them to stay for up to a year.
    

            While they were incredibly excited about the prospect of living somewhere new, they were also apprehensive.
    

            “There’s the financial crisis and the emotional crisis,” says Matarazzo. “A lot of our connection to what we were doing is being taken away.
    

            “Our whole social circle is gone. That familiarity of (knowing) where to get a good pizza, or places you’re guaranteed to get a bad pizza.
    

            “The basic things… We have to start all over. And you know, there’s that old saying, ‘It’s tough to make new old friends.’”
    

            Once they arrived in Kritsa, the pair were bowled over by the “kindness and generosity” of the locals, who warmly embraced them.
    

            “When we first moved to our little stone house, all our neighbors brought over gifts of food and produce,” says Mahan. “They continue to do that.”
    

            Their home, which has around 2,900 square feet of land with plenty of carob, lemon and pomegranate trees, as well as a vegetable garden, didn’t need much work.
    

            The couple say they’ve tried to put them own stamp on it while “honoring its traditional style,” adding skylights and repainting the walls.
    

            They quickly settled into life in the village, located around a 12-minute drive from the city of Agios Nikolaos in eastern Crete, and immediately felt safe there.
    

            “It’s a wonderful little village that we live in,” says Mahan, describing Kritsa as “a traditional village with traditional values” where people look out for each other and crime is pretty much non-existent.
    

            “There’s a sort of word of honor… These are very proud people. They’re proud of who they are.”

            Mahan and Matarazzo regularly go on hikes and spend their afternoons at the beach reading and swimming before heading home for dinner.
    

            They say they love the quietness of Kritsa and feel that their lifestyles are much healthier now.
    

            “The food we eat here is all local, and it’s seasonal,” says Mahan, before describing how they can collect mountain spring water “from taps all over town.”
    

            However, there are some things about living in the European country that the couple have found difficult to get used to – the Greek language being top of the list.
    

            “I’m learning a lot of vocabulary,” says Mahan, explaining that her “patient” neighbors have been helping her improve her Greek.
    

            “And I’m learning to string some sentences together, but it’s a difficult language. First you have to learn to read it, and then the pronunciation.”
    

            Mahan and Matarazzo have made many new friends, including some from other parts of the world, mainly the UK, Scandinavia, and France, who’ve relocated to the area.
    

            One of the things they appreciate most about living in Greece is the fact that it’s “an older culture.”
    

            “They have traditional ways that are tried and true,” says Mahan, pointing to venting in public as an example.
    

            “In America, it’s not really easy to vent – that’s why we have sports. If you get mad, especially in public, you’re considered crazy…
    

            “Not in these older cultures. People understand that people need to vent. So they let them…
    

            “And I appreciate that. I appreciate that there’s a place for people to be people.”
    

            Mahan goes on to stress that Crete is “different from the rest of Greece,” and she and Matarazzo feel a strong affinity with Cretans.
    

            “Cretans are more rugged people. They’re free spirits. And we are realizing that we too are free spirits. We can have fun at the drop of a hat.”
    

            Although they have found some things, such as appliances, to be more expensive, they say that life in Greece is more affordable for them overall.
    

            “Our house was very affordable for us,” says Mahan, noting that their household utilities are cheaper, and eating out costs less than it did in both the States and Mexico.
    

            “We could easily have a very good meal for 30 euros (around $32) for the two of us.”
    

            The couple have medical coverage in Greece – the country has a universal health care system, and say their experiences have been “excellent.”
    

            Mahan and Matarazzo still return to the US to visit their family and say they haven’t ruled out the notion of moving back one day, particularly if they were to need long term medical care.
    

            “We have free healthcare in the United States…” says Mahan. “Who knows what the future will bring? But right now it’s working.”
    

            The couple, who are in the process of applying for a two-year visa, are pleased with their decision, pointing out that they know many people who talk about moving away, but have never worked up the courage to do it.
    

            “One of my best friends has been talking about leaving the US for years,” says Matarazzo.
    

            “And he’s talking even more now about it. But all that’s ever happened was talking. And I keep telling him, it’s kind of a leap of faith.
    

            “Even though people don’t like what they’re used to. Doing something different is just too frightening for them.
    

            “Completely changing, throwing out the baby with the bathwater is the fear, I suppose.”
    

            While they admit that their new life hasn’t been without its challenges, the couple feel incredibly lucky to have been able to seek out new adventures while they are both still fit and healthy.
    

            “You’ve got to seize whatever aspects of life you can while you can do it,” adds Matarazzo.
    

            “When we came here the first time, I said to Patricia, ‘Let’s do it while we can walk. And maybe remember what we did.’ Cause we may get to a point where we can’t.”

            The head coach and players of Team USA’s women’s basketball endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid on Wednesday.
    

            It’s the first major political statement from a top American team at this year’s Olympics and comes as the presidential race is heating up back home.
    

            Harris took over the Democratic nomination earlier this month after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection bid and endorse his No. 2. She’s now attempting to gain momentum in the race against former President Donald Trump, who is running to regain the office he lost to Biden in 2020.

            The players on Team USA – and the WNBA in general –have been far more willing to engage in political statements than some of their other professional sports peers.
    

            “We have been talking, especially with the social justice committee, finding a way to make sure that we can obviously back Kamala as much as we can. Because everything that we’ve been kind of working for this year … has been about voting rights, reproductive rights,” said Breanna Stewart, a power forward who plays her professional ball for the New York Liberty.
    

            “The things she stands for, we also stand for. So making sure that we can definitely stay united and continue to push the message of registering to vote, knowing where to vote and all the resources behind it.”
    

            Women’s basketball players have had influential voices in key elections before.
    

            In 2020, the Atlanta Dream protested against their then co-owner – then Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was running for reelection against Rev. Stephen Warnock – over her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement. That race ended up going to a run-off and Warnock defeated Loeffler. He’s now serving as a senator from Georgia.
    

            “I think that’s a really important thing that our league has done through the years, using our voice as a vehicle for change, and I think no question that we would step to the plate in this scenario,” said Team USA head coach Cheryl Reeve, who also coaches the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx.
    

            “I think it’s really important that we don’t go backwards as we’ve seen, some of the threats to basic human rights, the things that we care about in our league, and so I’m proud to stand with the players in this in backing Kamala Harris.”
    

            WNBA legend Diana Taurasi added that she was thrilled to see Harris taking over the Democratic presidential ticket. Ultimately, it comes down to policy, she said.

            “What are you going to do for the people of America that need you? And I think there’s a big portion of us that see a lot of us in her and what she wants to do with our country,” Taurasi said. “For me, that is one of the proudest and most amazing moments, so yeah, we’re going to back her and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins and we go forward in this country in the right way.”
    

            The endorsement from the women’s Team USA comes a little less than a week after men’s star Stephen Curry said he was excited about Harris’ candidacy. Harris had visited the men’s basketball team during their training camp ahead of the Games.
    

            “If she’s on the ticket winning the election, like it’s, it’s a big, big deal to say the least and she represents the Bay Area,” Curry said last week. “She’s been a big supporter of us. And so I want to give that energy right back to her and just excited knowing, obviously, we’re representing our country here and this is a very monumental next couple of months for, for our country and the direction that we’re headed.”

CNN_54,Trump and Harris bash each other over outdated health insurance positions,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/health-insurance-trump-harris-fact-check/index.html,2024-07-31 23:44:00,politics,"
Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been attacking each other’s health insurance positions, warning what Americans could lose if their rival is elected president in November.
    

            “She wants to outlaw private health insurance,” Trump said Friday at the conservative Turning Point Action’s Believers’ Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida. “A lot of people have private health insurance. They want to keep it that way. It’s phenomenal.”
    

            The next day, Harris said at a fundraising event in Pittsfield, Massachusetts: “He intends to end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. You guys remember what that was? It was real. Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.”
    

Facts first: Neither Trump’s nor Harris’ claims reflect their rival’s most recent positions on health insurance. Trump most recently said he wants to improve the Affordable Care Act, not terminate it, though he promised for years that he would repeal it. Harris included a role for private insurers in the plan she released during her 2020 presidential campaign, though she had previously said she wanted to eliminate private insurance.


            Health insurance has been one of the most contentious issues in recent elections, both for the White House and Congress. Trump and Harris have both changed their stances on health care coverage, though neither has issued a detailed policy solution in this campaign. (Note: Harris only jumped into the race a little over a week ago when President Joe Biden announced he would not be running. She has yet to issue her policy platform.)
    

            Here’s a look at how their public positions have evolved.
    

            Let’s start with Trump’s claim that Harris wants to do away with private health insurance. At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market.
    

            “The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don’t have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require,” Harris said at the town hall, arguing that private health insurers are motivated by profits. “Who of us has not had that situation, where you’ve got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, ‘Well, I don’t know if your insurance company is going to cover this?’ Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on.”
    

            A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And the plan she rolled out in July 2019 included a role for private insurance.
    

            “We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.”
    

            Since she was named Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market.
    

            Harris’ campaign confirmed this week that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system.
    

            Trump has long wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, making it one of his top priorities in his 2016 presidential campaign and first term. However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House the following year, they failed to unite behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely overhaul the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare.
    

            The former president revived the debate over the law’s fate in November 2023, when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he’s “seriously looking at alternatives” and that the failure to terminate it “was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!”
    

            Some Republicans, however, were alarmed by Trump’s call, concerned that the issue is a political loser with Americans.
    

            Trump also quickly walked back his comments, posting a few days later that he doesn’t “want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE.Obamacare Sucks!!!”
    

            In April, Trump said in a video posted to Truth Social: “I’m not running to terminate the ACA as crooked Joe Biden says all over the place. We’re going to make the ACA much better than it is right now and much less expensive for you.”
    

            However, he has yet to release a proposal on how he would make the Affordable Care Act better and less expensive.
    

            Asked for comment, Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika noted that Trump has said to never give up on terminating Obamacare.
    

            “Donald Trump, a known liar, has been clear about one thing: if he’s elected, he will repeal the Affordable Care Act, rip away health care from tens of millions of Americans, eliminate coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions like diabetes or cancer, and kick young people off their parents’ insurance – just as he tried to do multiple times the last time he was in the White House,” she said.
    

            The Trump campaign did not return a request for comment.

            Entertaining the King of England is an expensive business, France is finding out.
    

            A sumptuous lobster dinner held to welcome Britain’s King Charles III to Paris last September cost the French president’s office nearly €475,000 ($515,000), according to accounts published on Monday by France’s public auditor.
    

            The lavish affair at the Palace of Versailles, which saw around 180 guests tuck into a feast of blue lobster, crab cakes and champagne-marinated chicken, helped blow an €8.3 million-sized hole ($9 million) in the Élysée Palace’s budget last year, the auditor said.

Macron pulls out all the stops for King Charles III’s rescheduled state visit to France


            The watchdog, which is responsible for scrutinizing presidential finances, including spending on staff, security and diplomatic duties, said the Élysée Palace’s expenses had topped €125 million ($136 million) during 2023 — up 14% from the previous year.
    

            The overspend was part of a much bigger French government budget deficit in 2023, which has just earned the country a rap on the knuckles from the European Union.
    

            The state dinner included outlays of more than €166,000 ($180,000) for catering and €42,000 ($46,000) for drinks, on top of other costs including furniture, flowers and table decorations.
    

            King Charles and his wife, Queen Camilla, attended the banquet as part of a three-day state visit to France, which had been postponed from earlier in 2023 because of widespread protests over Macron’s pension reforms. During the trip, King Charles praised the “indispensable relationship” between the UK and its neighbor in a historic speech to the French senate chamber.
    

            Mick Jagger, Hugh Grant and former French football manager Arsene Wenger were among the famous faces at the state dinner, which was held in Versailles’ glittering 240-foot (73-meter) long Hall of Mirrors — where, according to the palace’s website, France’s ill-fated monarchy once threw balls, weddings and entertained foreign dignitaries.
    

            The audit office is now playing the role of party pooper, warning that “significant efforts will need to be undertaken from 2024 in order to restore and sustain the financial balance of the presidency.” It noted that another state dinner, thrown for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year in the Louvre, came to €412,000 ($447,000).
    

            The European Union handed France an official warning last month over its budget deficit, which stood at 5.5% of gross domestic product last year — one of the highest among the 27-member bloc. France’s national debt has also ballooned to nearly 111% percent of GDP.
    

            The Élysée Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CNN_56,Killing of Hamas leader leaves Gaza ceasefire hopes dangling by a thread,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/hamas-hezbollah-leaders-killed-gaza-war-what-it-means-mime-intl/index.html,2024-07-31 23:34:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.


            The assassination of the political leader of Hamas has plunged the Middle East into fresh crisis and dented already slim hopes of an end to the war between Israel and the militant group that rules Gaza anytime soon.
    

            Hamas on Wednesday said Israel killed its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, hours after Israel claimed a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah commander who it blamed for a deadly attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh’s killing.
    

            Experts say the assassinations throw an ominous shadow on efforts to procure a ceasefire-hostage deal in Gaza, as well as hopes of de-escalation between Israel and its Iran-backed rivals in the region.
    

            Here’s what the killing of the Hamas and Hezbollah leaders means for the Gaza war and the region.
    

            Months of negotiations on a deal to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas had already hit repeated roadblocks before Haniyeh, a key player in the talks, was killed on Tuesday night.
    

            As recently as early July, Haniyeh was in touch with mediators in Qatar and Egypt to discuss ideas on ending the war, sparking some hope that the two sides could be on the brink of a framework agreement.
    

            All of that could now be thrown up in the air by his death.

What we know about the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh


            A source with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN Wednesday that Haniyeh’s assassination could “complicate mediation talks,” as he had been “instrumental” to their progress. The source said Haniyeh was a “key decision-maker,” along with Hamas’ military leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar,
    

            “He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” the source said, adding that “at this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on ceasefire talks.”
    

            Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas talks, wrote on X: “Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?”
    

            Qatar, which has helped release some of the Israeli hostages, sheltered the Hamas leader before his death, and the group’s political bureau has been based in its capital Doha since 2012.
    

            Questions will also be asked about the calculations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who many observers – including families of the hostages – have accused of deliberately stalling on negotiations and dragging out the war to safeguard his own political survival.
    

            “Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged ceasefire talks because ending the war will likely end his political career,” said Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute, a US-based foreign policy think tank, in a post on X. “The assassination buys Netanyahu several weeks, if not months, in which there will be no serious expectation of a ceasefire deal.”
    

            Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, noted that negotiations were already deadlocked even before the assassination of Haniyeh.
    

            Now, Baskin said, it is unclear how much longer Qatari and Egyptian mediators will allow themselves “to be played by Israel and Hamas,” adding that it may be time for the mediators to put a deal on the table and ask parties to “take it or leave it.”
    

            “And if they leave it, perhaps it’s time for them to leave the parties to themselves,” Baskin told CNN.
    

            A faltered negotiation process also extends the risk to the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza.
    

            The Hostages Families Forum said Wednesday that “true achievement” in the war can only be realized with the release of all hostages still in captivity, saying they “implore the Israeli government and global leaders to decisively advance negotiations.”
    

            “Time is of the essence,” the Forum said in a statement. “This is the time for a deal.”
    

            There are 111 hostages still in Gaza, including 39 believed to be dead, according to data from Netanyahu’s office. Their families have repeatedly slammed Netanyahu for failing to secure their release.
    

            Without a ceasefire, Gaza’s besieged population will find no respite from the war, which has so far killed more than 39,000 people, according to the health ministry in the strip. Swathes of the territory have been flattened, and a humanitarian crisis is rapidly spiraling out of control.
    

            The war, which Israel launched in response to Hamas’ October 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, has also displaced almost all of Gaza’s population of 2 million, with 86% of the territory now under Israeli evacuation orders.
    

            Qatar’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said Haniyeh’s killing “would lead to the region sliding into a cycle of chaos and undermine the chances of peace.”
    

            Egypt, a key mediator in the conflict but whose ties with Israel have been strained since October 7, had condemned what it called “Israel’s dangerous policy of escalation” and warned against “the nonsense policy of assassination and violation of the sovereignty of states.”
    

            In a statement, Egypt said the two killings risk “igniting” confrontation in the region.
    

            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the United States was “not aware of or involved in” Haniyeh’s killing and that the Biden administration had been working “from day one” for a ceasefire to prevent the conflict from spreading to other regions.
    

            HA Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, said that unless there is an active effort to cool tensions in the region, “escalation will happen by, unfortunately, default.”
    

            “The United States has not been willing to use the leverage it actually has on Israel… in order to force Israel into a serious negotiation position,” Hellyer told CNN’s Becky Anderson. “This isn’t sustainable.”

CNN_57,A potential tropical threat is taking shape near the Caribbean as hurricane season reignites,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/weather/tropical-depression-atlantic-florida-hurricane-season/index.html,2024-07-31 23:01:00,world,"
            The eerie calm over the Atlantic basin that settled in after historic Hurricane Beryl is about to be shattered.
    

            It’s been more than three weeks since deadly Beryl made its final landfall in Texas. Dry, dusty air has helped keep the Atlantic hurricane-free ever since.
    

            But a disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms in the eastern Caribbean is expected to encounter favorable atmospheric conditions by this weekend and develop into a tropical depression or tropical storm.
    

            The next tropical storm that forms will be given the name Debby.
    

            The system will track along the northern Caribbean through Friday before emerging near the Bahamas or Florida early this weekend.
    

            It’s exact track through the Caribbean will determine when a tropical system could form. It will likely struggle to organize enough to be considered a tropical depression or storm if it interacts with the disruptive mountainous areas of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and eastern Cuba.
    

            The tropical wave could organize sooner if it skims just north of the islands and dodges the terrain.
    

            Ocean temperatures in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf are abnormally warm and could strengthen the system, no matter when and where it forms.
    

            It’s still unclear what path the system will take. A strong area of high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean could steer the cyclone anywhere from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to the southeast US coast over the weekend, but its early strength or lack thereof will play a factor in which way it will go.
    

            The faster organization occurs, the more likely the cyclone will curve northward sooner and take a track that places the Bahamas and southeast US in its path. A more disorganized system could travel much farther west and approach the Gulf before curving north.
    

            August typically marks the beginning of the most active part of hurricane season because ocean waters are very warm, and disruptive upper-level winds and dry, dusty air fade.
    

            But ocean temperatures across the Atlantic have been anything but typical this season, and have already proved their mettle.
    

            Beryl was able to become the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in early July partly because waters in the Caribbean were as warm as they normally would be at the peak of hurricane season. Now, parts of the Caribbean and Atlantic are as warm or warmer than they typically are in early October when ocean heat maxes out.
    

Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace.
    

            Off-the-charts ocean heat is one reason a chorus of forecasters are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season. A building La Niña and its subsequent lack of disruptive upper level winds, known as wind shear, over the Atlantic are the others.
    

            The season started off close to average when Tropical Storm Alberto formed in mid-June – the typical timing for the first named storm of the season. But any semblance of normalcy quickly dissipated once Beryl roared to life at the end of the month.
    

            The season’s first hurricane normally forms around August 11 and the first Category 3 or stronger hurricane occurs around September 1, according to the NHC. Beryl obliterated both timeframes.
    

            In addition to Alberto and Beryl, the basin also churned out short-lived Tropical Storm Chris.

            “The things she stands for, we also stand for. So making sure that we can definitely stay united and continue to push the message of registering to vote, knowing where to vote and all the resources behind it.”
    

            Women’s basketball players have had influential voices in key elections before.
    

            In 2020, the Atlanta Dream protested against their then co-owner – then Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who was running for reelection against Rev. Stephen Warnock – over her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement. That race ended up going to a run-off and Warnock defeated Loeffler. He’s now serving as a senator from Georgia.
    

            “I think that’s a really important thing that our league has done through the years, using our voice as a vehicle for change, and I think no question that we would step to the plate in this scenario,” said Team USA head coach Cheryl Reeve, who also coaches the WNBA’s Minnesota Lynx, on Wednesday.
    

            “I think it’s really important that we don’t go backwards as we’ve seen, some of the threats to basic human rights, the things that we care about in our league, and so I’m proud to stand with the players in this in backing Kamala Harris.”
    

            WNBA legend Diana Taurasi added Wednesday that she was thrilled to see Harris taking over the Democratic presidential ticket. Ultimately, it comes down to policy, she said.

            “What are you going to do for the people of America that need you? And I think there’s a big portion of us that see a lot of us in her and what she wants to do with our country,” Taurasi said. “For me, that is one of the proudest and most amazing moments, so yeah, we’re going to back her and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure she wins and we go forward in this country in the right way.”
    

            The endorsement from the women’s Team USA comes a little less than a week after men’s star Stephen Curry said he was excited about Harris’ candidacy. Harris had visited the men’s basketball team during their training camp ahead of the Games.
    

            “If she’s on the ticket winning the election, like it’s, it’s a big, big deal to say the least and she represents the Bay Area,” Curry said last week. “She’s been a big supporter of us. And so I want to give that energy right back to her and just excited knowing, obviously, we’re representing our country here and this is a very monumental next couple of months for, for our country and the direction that we’re headed.”

CNN_59,Secret Service detains man for incident involving security detail for Harris’ stepdaughter,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/secret-service-detail-ella-emhoff/index.html,2024-08-01 01:19:00,politics,"
            The US Secret Service protective detail of Vice President Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhoff was involved in an incident Tuesday in which a man caused damage to two of her protective detail’s vehicles in New York City.
    

            “On Tuesday afternoon, an individual approached two United States Secret Service vehicles parked in lower Manhattan and, without provocation, caused damage to the rear license plate area of both,” USSS spokesperson James Byrne said in a statement shared with CNN.
    

            The man was detained by USSS with New York authorities putting him in police custody.
    

            The incident comes at a moment of heightened scrutiny for the Secret Service just weeks after an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump – and days after the agency’s director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the fallout.
    

            “Secret Service Agents quickly detained the individual until local authorities arrived and placed the individual into police custody,” Byrne said. “At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident.”
    

            Spokespeople for the vice president and second gentleman did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            It’s not the first incident involving a USSS protectee’s vehicle. Last November, a USSS agent on President Joe Biden’s granddaughter Naomi Biden’s security detail shot at individuals attempting to break into a US government vehicle in Georgetown.

CNN_60,Groundbreaking executive White House chef steps down,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/cristeta-comerford-white-house-chef/index.html,2024-08-01 01:10:00,politics,"
            White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford has retired after nearly three decades cooking for five commanders-in-chief and their families, a White House official tells CNN.
    

            Comerford, who broke ground as the first woman and person of color to hold the top job in the White House kitchen, arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania during the Clinton administration in 1995 and was elevated to executive chef by first lady Laura Bush 10 years later.
    

            Comerford cooked for America’s first families over 29 years, including the Clintons, Bushes, Obamas, Trumps and Bidens, overseeing all White House cuisine from family meals to state dinners in the executive chef role. Her last day was Friday, the White House official said.
    

            “I always say, food is love. Through her barrier-breaking career, Chef Cris has led her team with warmth and creativity, and nourished our souls along the way. With all our hearts, Joe and I are filled with gratitude for her dedication and years of service,” first lady Jill Biden said in a statement.
    

            Comerford oversaw a team of three sous chefs and executive pastry chef Susie Morrison.
    

            “To be a White House chef, it’s really your temperance that really counts for a lot. Because it’s not just your knowledge and your skills and the way you cook – it has to be the way you treat people, the way you delegate your work, the way you put your team as a cohesive force,” she said in a 2014 interview with CNN.
    

            She added, “At any point in time that you cook for the first family and cook for the president of the United States, it’s such a humbling experience.”
    

            Born and raised in Manila, Comerford emigrated to the US when she was 23 years old, and she said she worked as a “salad girl” in Chicago hotels making Caesar and cobb salads. She worked as a chef at two Washington, DC, hotels, and spent six months in Vienna, Austria, learning French culinary techniques, before being recruited to work at the White House.
    

            In 2005, she was one of about 450 applicants for the executive chef role, which included what she described as a final “cook-off” round.

CNN_61,South Carolina Supreme Court rules state death penalty including firing squad is legal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/south-carolina-death-penalty-firing-squad-legal/index.html,2024-08-01 00:41:00,us,"
            The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state’s death penalty, which now includes a firing squad as well as lethal injection and the electric chair, is legal.
    

            All five justices agreed with at least part of the ruling, opening the door to restart executions in a state that hasn’t put an inmate to death since 2011. But two of the justices said they felt the firing squad was not a legal way to kill an inmate and one of them felt the electric chair is a cruel and unusual punishment.
    

            The death penalty law is legal because instead of seeking to inflict pain, the choice between the three execution methods makes it appear that lawmakers are genuinely against inflicting pain and making the death penalty as humane as possible, Associate Justice John Few wrote in the majority opinion.
    

            As many as eight inmates may be out of traditional appeals. It is unclear when executions could restart or whether lawyers for death row inmates can appeal the ruling.
    

            South Carolina has executed 43 inmates since the death penalty was restarted in the US in 1976. Nearly all inmates have chosen lethal injection.

South Carolina death row inmate chooses to be executed by firing squad over the electric chair


            “Choice cannot be considered cruel because the condemned inmate may elect to have the State employ the method he and his lawyers believe will cause him the least pain,” Few wrote.
    

            South Carolina hasn’t performed an execution since 2011. The state’s supplies of drugs for lethal injections expired and no pharmaceutical companies would sell more if they could be publicly identified.
    

            Lawmakers authorized the state to create a firing squad in 2021 to give inmates a choice between it and the old electric chair. The inmates sued, saying either choice was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Constitution.
    

            In spring 2023, the Legislature passed a shield law to keep lethal injection drug suppliers secret and the state announced in September it had the sedative pentobarbital and changed the method of lethal injection execution from using three drugs to just one.
    

            The Supreme Court allowed the inmates to add arguments that the shield law was too secret by not releasing the potency, purity and stabilization of lethal injection drugs.
    

            South Carolina has 32 inmates on its death row. Four prisoners are suing, but four more have also run out of appeals, although two of them face a competency hearing before they could be executed, according to Justice 360, a group that describes itself as fighting for the inmates and for fairness and transparency in death penalty and other major criminal cases.
    

            The state said in its argument before the state Supreme Court in February that lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad all fit existing death penalty protocols. “Courts have never held the death has to be instantaneous or painless,” wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for Gov. Henry McMaster’s office.
    

            But lawyers for the inmates asked the justices to agree with Circuit Judge Jocelyn Newman who stopped executions with the electric chair or firing squad.

South Carolina may become the fourth state to allow executions by firing squad


            She cited the inmates’ experts, who testified at a trial that prisoners would feel terrible pain whether their bodies were “cooking” by 2,000 volts of electricity in the chair, built in 1912, or if their hearts were stopped by bullets — assuming the three shooters were on target — from the yet-to-be used firing squad.


            On the shield law, the attorneys for the inmate said they need to know if there is a regular supplier for the drug since it typically only has a shelf life of 45 days and what guidelines are in place to test the drug and make sure it is what the seller claims.
    

            Too weak, and inmates may suffer without dying. Too strong, and the drug molecules can form tiny clumps that would cause intense pain when injected, according to court papers.
    

            “No inmate in the country has ever been put to death with such little transparency about how he or she would be executed,” Justice 360 lawyer Lindsey Vann wrote.
    

            Lawyers for the inmates did tell the justices in February that lethal injection appears to be legal when it follows proper protocols, with information about the drug given to the condemned in a manner that matches what other states and the federal government use.
    

            South Carolina used to carry out an average of three executions a year and had more than 60 inmates on death row when the last execution was carried out. Since then, successful appeals and natural deaths have lowered the number to 32.
    

            Prosecutors have sent only three new prisoners to death row in the past 13 years. Facing rising costs, the lack of lethal injection drugs and more vigorous defenses, they are choosing to accept guilty pleas and life in prison without parole.

CNN_62,"StubHub tricks people with ‘bait-and-switch’ pricing scheme, DC attorney general alleges",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/business/stubhub-tickets-fees-lawsuit/index.html,2024-08-01 01:16:00,us,"
            Millions of sports fans and concertgoers are being duped by a deceptive pricing scheme at StubHub that hides the true cost of tickets until the very last moment, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb.
    

            The lawsuit accuses StubHub of deploying pricing tactics that “trick” consumers into overpaying for tickets and are designed to boost profits.
    

            “StubHub uses a classic bait-and-switch scheme,” the lawsuit said, describing what’s known as “drip pricing” where only part of the product’s price is advertised initially.
    

            The attorney general’s office describes how StubHub uses a countdown clock to create a “false sense of urgency” to ensure consumers are “pressured into the purchase out of fear that they risk losing the tickets.”
    

            Since StubHub adopted this pricing model in 2015, the company has sold almost 5 million tickets to Washington, DC, consumers alone, generating $118 million in “hidden” fee revenue, according to the attorney general’s office.
    

            “StubHub lures consumers in by advertising a deceptively low price, forces them through a burdensome purchase process, and then finally reveals a total on the checkout page that is vastly higher than the original advertised ticket price,” Schwalb said in a statement on Wednesday. “This is no accident—StubHub intentionally hides the true price to boost profits at its customers’ expense.”
    

            In response, StubHub’s deputy general counsel John Lawrence said in a statement that the company is “committed to creating a transparent, secure and competitive marketplace to benefit consumers.”
    

            “We are disappointed that the DC Attorney General is targeting StubHub when our user experience is consistent with the law, our competitors’ practices, and the broader e-commerce sector,” Lawrence said. “We strongly support federal and state solutions that enhance existing laws to empower consumers, such as requiring all-in pricing uniformly across platforms.”
    

            According to the lawsuit, StubHub did use an “all-in pricing” model from 2014 to 2015 where the advertised prices included the mandatory fees.
    

            However, the company abandoned that more transparent model after testing found that customers were more likely to ultimately buy tickets when those fees are only shown at the end, the lawsuit said.

CNN_63,Wildfire safety tips from the experts,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/how-to-survive-avoid-wildfire/index.html,2024-08-01 00:03:00,world,"
            Walls of bright orange flames. Harrowing escapes. The charred shells of what’s left behind. It’s hard not to be terrified by images of deadly wildfires.
    

            Jon Heggie – who has been a division chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) – knows what’s it’s like facing down a wildfire.
    

            “I’ve been in my fair share of major incidents up and down the state,” Heggie told CNN Travel. “A description will not ever do it justice. The sights, the sounds, the feelings – the energy you feel from a large-scale incident is sensory overload,” he said.
    

            “You can feel the radiant heat penetrating your body basically, the smoke conditions that kind of blur your vision. … [The] sound of numerous trees being engulfed, it basically shakes the ground. It’s quite a dramatic event when you’re at the fire front of a large fire.”
    

            The hard-earned experience of Heggie and other experts can help the rest of us increase our chances of survival in a wildfire – or avoid being trapped in one.
    

            Residents in wildfire-prone areas of the United States and the rest of the world might be used to keeping up with news of wildfires. It behooves travelers, who might have less experience, to do the same.
    

            “Keep situational awareness. Pay attention to the local news. Pay attention to your local surroundings,” Heggie said. “… If you’re in a wildland area, you must pay attention to your surroundings because if a fire were to start, it can very quickly move in directions that can put people in harm’s way.”
    

            Beth Pratt, California regional executive director of the National Wildlife Federation, owns a home just outside fire-prone Yosemite National Park and echoes that advice through decades of experience.
    

            “Stay alert. Know you might need to be flexible with your plans or routes,” she said.
    

            Nick Mott, co-author of the book “This Is Wildfire: How to Protect Yourself, Your Home, and Your Community in the Age of Heat,” said to pay attention to so-called red flag warnings.
    

            “So basically, those are weather warnings when there’s high fire danger.” Watch for “super-high heat, high winds.”
    

            “If you’re a traveler, it might be smart to stay out of an area that seems prone to burn,” he said.
    

            The Red Cross also advises that you might want to leave an area before there’s even an official evacuation notice.
    

            Some more preparedness tips:
    

            • Get alerts to your phone: Sign up for alerts at readyforwildfire.org, Heggie suggested. On a road trip, listen to local talk radio and news stations. AirNow also tracks wildfires in North America. The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) can help people traveling there. My Fire Watch can help with tracking in Australia.

            • Be prepared to get away: When you’re in wildfire-prone areas, you should not only have an escape plan, but also an alternative escape route to that, Heggie said. And Mott added that travelers shouldn’t rely just on Google maps. Have a physical map at the ready in case service is interrupted.
    

            • Have a survival kit: Keep plenty of water, extra food and clothes in the vehicle in case you do get caught up in an emergency – “all the things you would need to survive for camping,” Heggie said. The Red Cross suggests you have a battery-powered radio, too.
    

            • Mask up: “Be sure to have a mask handy for the smoke, because air quality can get bad fast,” Pratt said. Use an N-95 mask, Mott advises.
    

            • Be on the vanguard: If you see smoke or fire, report it immediately, Pratt said.


            In the past, you could think of summer in California and other places out West as the “fire season.” But not anymore. Watch for big swings in conditions year to year and season to season.
    

            “We don’t think about disaster until it happens,” Mott said. “We need to be thinking about wildfire, in particular, year-round – not just in fire season.”
    

            Mott said we also are having to expand our horizons about where wildfires might happen. They aren’t just a mainland Western US problem, as the deadly 2023 Maui fires demonstrated. Any place with hot weather, dried-up brush and grass and high winds could have a wildfire, he said.
    

            East of the Mississippi River, an area that generally gets more rain than the bulk of the West, can see wildfires. After a dry autumn, fires killed more than 10 people in the Gatlinburg, Tennessee, area in 2016.
    

            And it’s a global hazard. As Europe baked in broiling heat in 2023, wildfires on the normally idyllic Greek island of Rhodes sent tourists fleeing a hellscape.
    

            And 2024 is offering no relief. Spring wildfires broke out in the Amazonian rainforest in Venezuela, which suffered from drought. As a hot July was ending, the Park Fire in Northern California and a wildfire in the Jasper National Park area in the Rockies of Canada grabbed headlines.
    

            If you’re in a car and a wildfire is beginning to surround you, resist the urge to jump out.
    

            “Vehicles are very good at protecting yourself from fires. If you’re completely overrun by fire, take shelter inside your vehicle – you’re going to be much better off than outside of the vehicle. … It’s not a guarantee, but it’s better than nothing,” Heggie said.
    

            “If you can see well enough, you should try to [drive] out of the fire area.
    

            “Other tips if you’re in your vehicle from Readyforwildfire.org:
    

            • Close all vehicle windows and vents
    

            • Cover yourself with a jacket or blanket
    

            • If possible, lie on the vehicle floor
    

            It’s the same idea with a house or other structure – you have a better chance inside it than outside, Heggie said. Let the fire sweep across the lot while you hunker down inside.
    

            “There’s a good chance the structure will catch on fire, and after that, then you need to exit outside the structure, obviously.”
    

            While riding out a wildfire inside a structure, Idaho Firewise offers these tips:
    

            • Close all windows and doors and place wet towels under door and window openings.
    

            • Have fire extinguishers out and ready to use.
    

            • Fill sinks, tubs and buckets with water to put out any embers.
    

            If you’re trapped outdoors with a wildfire approaching, call 911 and give them your exact location, Heggie said. Rescuers might be able to get a helicopter to you or firefighters can try to put the fire out around you.
    

            Try to get away downhill but not into a gulch or ravine, Heggie said. It’s harder to escape hoofing it uphill. Plus, high-rising flames can reach toward uphill fuel, and the rising convective heat can expand uphill.

            Heggie said the worst place to hunker down: low-lying gulches or ditches filled with dry vegetation. Stay out of ravines, which can act as fire funnels.
    

            Take refuge in or near a body of water if you can reach one, Mott said, as some people did in Maui. “If you’re out in the wilderness or say out on the beach, get in the water. People have successfully waited out wildfires in lakes and rivers.”
    

            If you’re trapped by a fire and can’t swim, Mott said get in as far as you’re comfortable – just don’t get over your shoulders or where you might be swept away.
    

            If trapped outdoors, the University of California’s Agriculture and Natural Resources department seconds trying to find areas that won’t burn as readily or at all: irrigated fields, golf courses, paved parking lots and ponds. You can try to shelter by boulders and rock outcrops.
    

            Like mines left over after a war, wildfires leave potential dangers after they’ve burned through.
    

The Red Cross advises:
    

            • Avoid hot ash, smoldering debris and live embers.
    

            • Stay clear of damaged or fallen power lines, poles and downed wires.
    

            • Watch for pits in the ground filled with ash. They may have hot embers you can’t see.
    

            Mott said we should think ahead and prepare for wildfire but also “don’t worry yourself sick about it. I think that’s important for mental health, too, to find a positive outlook on the world and not think only about worst-case scenarios.”

CNN_64,Donald Trump falsely suggests Kamala Harris ‘turned Black’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html,2024-08-01 02:58:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his 2024 Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, “turned Black” a few years ago after “all of a sudden, she made a turn” in her identity.
    

            Trump’s comments at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago came when an interviewer asked him why Black voters should consider backing a candidate with his history of racist attacks on political rivals. Trump responded by questioning Harris’ heritage.
    

            “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said.
    

            “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a Black person,” he said. “I think somebody should look into that too.”
    

            Trump’s comments are reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.
    

            Harris’ mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically Black university, Howard University, in Washington. She is the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.

While California battles the fifth-largest wildfire in state history, a trio of wildfires near Denver has forced hundreds of evacuations and claimed at least one life. Here’s the latest on a barrage of blazes burning in several western states: 


• Colorado’s Stone Canyon Fire turns deadly: The remains of a fire victim were found Wednesday inside a home in the path of the Stone Canyon Fire – one of three wildfires ravaging the Denver area, Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said Wednesday.

            The Stone Canyon Fire has scorched more than 1,300 acres and impacted at least five structures. As firefighting efforts continue, evacuation orders for parts of the town of Lyon were lifted. But some gas service in those neighborhoods was turned off as a precautionary measure, the sheriff said. “Getting people back in with utilities will take some time,” he said.
    

• Colorado’s Quarry Fire spreads rapidly: Emergency crews raced to evacuate homes southwest of Denver overnight as the Quarry Fire, previously known as the Wildland Fire, threatened several subdivisions, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said. On Wednesday morning, the blaze expanded from 50 acres to about “200 acres and growing,” the sheriff’s office posted on X. By midday Wednesday, the inferno was still 0% contained.
    

• Firefighters struggle with limited resources and “a rattlesnake problem”: The Quarry Fire will be tough to fight due to the terrain and the number of other wildfires searing parts of Colorado, local officials said. “We don’t know if we’re going to get any air support today or not,” Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Mark Techmeyer said Wednesday.
    

            In addition to the Quarry and Stone Canyon fires, Colorado is also grappling with the Alexander Mountain Fire, which has singed more than 5,000 acres north of Denver and was 0% contained as of Tuesday.
    

            While no injuries have been reported from the Quarry Fire, firefighters face new hazards with the blaze. The terrain is mountainous, steep and “really hard to navigate on foot,” Techmeyer said. On top of that, “We have a rattlesnake problem to deal with.”
    

• California’s Park Fire is bigger than the size of Los Angeles: The weeklong inferno, which started July 24 in Northern California, is now the fifth-largest wildfire in state history. It has swallowed more than 389,000 acres, or 607 square miles, according to Cal Fire.
    

            More than 5,700 personnel are battling the blaze, using more than 500 fire engines and 40 helicopters. “This region, both Butte and Tehama (counties) … has had four of the largest 10 fires known in history,” Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See said. As of Wednesday morning, the Park Fire had destroyed at least 227 structures and was 18% contained.
    

            • Newsom declares state of emergency for another wildfire: In Southern California, the Borel Fire has ravaged Kern County and decimated a historic mining community. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited affected communities Tuesday and proclaimed a state of emergency. The governor previously declared a state of emergency for the Park and Gold Complex fires.

            • Suspect accused of starting the Park Fire could face more charges: Ronnie Dean Stout II, the man suspected of starting the Park Fire, has been charged with arson, according to a felony criminal complaint filed Monday. Authorities said a witness saw him pushing a burning car down a 60-foot embankment.
    

            Stout claims he did not push the car, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told reporters. The suspect didn’t enter a plea during a court appearance Monday and was denied bail. His arraignment was continued to Thursday, Ramsey said, and more charges could be added.
    

            • Resident loses two homes in separate wildfires: Standing in the charred remains of his house, Butte County resident Rick Pero told CNN affiliate KHSL the Park Fire was the second California inferno to destroy his home. After the deadly 2018 Camp Fire obliterated his house, Pero and his wife moved to the Forest Ranch community in Butte County. There, Pero educated his neighbors on defensible space – which he credits for helping save dozens of neighbors’ homes. But the precaution didn’t save his own home, Pero told KHSL: “It was just too much Mother Nature.”
    

            • Oregon firefighters battle mammoth blaze as temperatures soar: Oregon’s largest wildfire, the Durkee Fire, has charred more than 293,000 acres – with no rainfall in sight. The blaze, which was ignited by lightning near the Oregon-Idaho border on July 17, was 52% contained as of Wednesday morning, according to InciWeb. No rainfall is expected the rest of the week, and temperatures are expected to soar to triple digits by the weekend – potentially impairing firefighting efforts.

            • 95 large wildfires are raging in the US: Across the country, 95 major wildfires are burning – scorching a combined 2.1 million acres (and counting), the National Interagency Fire Center said Wednesday. Among them, 35 infernos were spreading in Oregon, 12 in California and 10 in Idaho.
    

            “So far in 2024, 28,154 wildfires have burned 4,449,282 acres,” the fire center said. The amount of land torched so far this year is more than the square mileage of Connecticut.
    

            The agency stressed the need to have firefighters and firefighting resources available for an “initial attack” in areas with a high likelihood of fire breaking out. “The vast majority of fire starts are contained at small sizes within 24 hours of their discovery,” the fire center said.
    

            Gusty winds could further fuel fires this week as the heat is expected to intensify across much of the West through Friday. Temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal are expected across parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Rockies, and daily high temperature records could be tied or broken this weekend – especially in the Pacific Northwest.

CNN_66,"IHOP, Denny’s join value menu wars to win back price-conscious consumers",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/business/ihop-all-you-can-eat-pancakes-five-dollars/index.html,2024-08-01 02:55:00,us,"
            It’s a summer for single-digit dollar deals as IHOP and Denny’s join other big-name food chains in offering value menu options. The two companies are the latest restaurants trying to appeal to consumers being more selective with their dollars in the wake of price increases.
    

            IHOP announced this week that it is bringing back its $5 all-you-can-eat pancake deal. The promotion, which runs until September 15, is meant to align with back-to-school season when “wallets are pinched from shopping,” the company said in a statement. IHOP announced the same promotion with much fanfare around the same time last summer as part of its 65-year anniversary.
    

            And family dining chain Denny’s is hot on its heels, announcing Tuesday that it would offer meal options for as low as $2 as part of its returning $2-$4-$6-$8 value menu. Denny’s last held the promotion in 2020 for its 10th anniversary, and ut was touted by its executives as a “consumer-friendly traffic-driving platform” in a June earnings call.
    

            The move makes IHOP and Denny’s the latest food joints, after McDonald’s, Taco Bell, KFC, Wendy’s and others, to roll out single-digit value meals as part of an effort lure in price-weary customers.

Fast food is expensive. Applebee’s and Chili’s are moving in


            With inflation still running higher than normal, consumers have been warier of spending their dollars on increasingly pricey quick food. Starbucks, for example, reported a second-straight quarter of sales declines.
    

            And earlier this year, disgruntled customers pushed back against McDonalds’ prices hikes, taking to social media to express outrage over a single hash brown costing $3. Weaker-than-expected sales eventually forced the fast food chain to bring in value meal promotions and focus on affordability.
    

            “The industry is really in a state right now where consumers have pulled back pretty significantly because prices have just gone up so far, so fast,” said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm, in an interview with CNN. “This is just part and parcel of what the restaurant industry is trying to do to win back consumers and to enhance their value perception.”
    

            Restaurants have been faced with rapidly decelerating foot traffic, Henkes said. He says that IHOP’s dine-in only deal is meant to spur customers into returning to stores.
    

            “The first step is to get people in the restaurant, and that’s what a lot of these value meals are meant to do,” he said. “As a restaurateur, you hope that they’re not just taking advantage of the deal, they’re buying extras, they’re adding on sausages or some other breakfast meat.”

CNN_67,"The Fed keeps interest rates at current levels, but signals a cut is coming",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/economy/july-fed-meeting-preview/index.html,2024-08-01 02:07:00,us,"
            The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will continue to hold its benchmark interest rate at current levels, marking a full year since the cost of borrowing first reached a 23-year high.
    

            As expected, central bank officials chose not to cut rates, which would have paved the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards.
    

            However, the Fed gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months: Fed officials are now wary of risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement.

Fed opts to hold interest rates steady — but a cut could be coming in September


            Officials wrote that inflation is now “somewhat” elevated — the first time inflation has been described in such a way since the Fed began to lift rates in March 2022. At last month’s meeting, the Fed’s statement said, “Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.” The latest statement implies that the central bank believes inflation is even less of a risk compared to its last meeting.
    

            This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs.
    

            Central bankers have said in recent speeches that they’re pleased with the latest inflation data, and some have pointed to the risks of not cutting rates with inflation inching closer to the central bank’s 2% target.
    

            Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged. That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point. In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that an unexpected deterioration in the job market would prompt officials to consider cutting rates sooner.
    

            But for now, the Fed has a solid chance at successfully taming inflation without a recession, an exceptionally rare achievement known as a “soft landing.”
    

            For now, the American economy remains on solid footing. Just look at the government’s latest report on gross domestic product, which showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions. The report was surprising because it also showed that inflation slowed during that period, even as the economy strengthened.
    

            The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target.
    

            It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist. The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom. Last year, an expanding workforce and a burst in productivity growth helped corral inflation while the broader economy remained intact.

It’s not the end of the world if the Fed doesn’t cut rates


            But it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy. For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart. Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences.
    

            The one weak spot that could become worrisome for the Fed is today’s US job market, which is now less robust than it has been in recent years. Demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace, and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%. It could just be a normalization from the gangbuster times of recent years, or it could be the beginning of a steeper slowdown.
    

            The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US labor market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday.

CNN_68,Look of the Week: Megan Thee Stallion and Kamala Harris serve the power pantsuit two ways,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/style/megan-thee-stallion-kamala-harris-pantsuit-lotw/index.html,2024-08-01 02:12:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.


            Two suits, two women, one message: “Hotties for Harris.” At least that was the phrase scrawled across banners at Kamala Harris’ campaign rally in Atlanta Tuesday night.
    

            The event — part of Harris’s bid to secure the Democratic presidential nomination — was headlined with a performance from rapper Megan Thee Stallion, 29, whose fans nickname themselves “hotties,” after the chart-topping 2019 track “Hot Girl Summer.”
    

            The three-time Grammy winner arrived on stage to perform in a pair of second-skin cobalt flares, a matching cropped blazer and tie by designer Abdul Sall. Underneath, her white collared shirt was similarly slashed at the midriff, exposing her gleaming belly button stud.
    

            Minutes later, Harris walked onto her podium to rapturous applause — also in a blue pantsuit. Considering Megan’s typical stage wear features thong leotards and sheer catsuits, it doesn’t take a seasoned fashion critic to pick up on the sartorial message. At first glance they might have been twinned; two women from very different corners, at the top of their respective careers, defining power dressing on their own terms. (Harris did, however, adopt some of Megan’s swagger with her challenge to Donald Trump to debate her: “If you have something to say, say it to my face.”)
    

            The choreographed spectacle was a continuation of the Harris team’s modus operandi: Meeting the Gen Z voters where they are. From being endorsed by Charli XCX and co-opting the album of the summer, “Brat,” to capitalizing on the 32.3 million-strong fandom of Megan Thee Stallion, her advisors have been honing in on the 18-27 demographic.

            But how do you capture the attention of younger voters without alienating your core audience?
    

            What Harris seems to be trialing is the power of association: While she remains unchanged, and stylistically understated (the New York Times’ chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman went further, calling her a “dull” dresser, while acknowledging the double standard), her endorsers do the heavy lifting. So, if the Vice President remains set on cycling through a rotating wardrobe of near-identical neutral pantsuits eternally paired with her trusty “70-millimeter Manolo Blahnik heels,” — then perhaps Megan was a kind of proxy, doing the daredevil, eye-catching dressing for her.
    

            Megan isn’t the first musician to offer an endorsement to a presidential candidate (though Harris won’t be officially selected at the Democratic National Convention until August). During Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016, pop culture endorsements were there in equal measure from Madonna to Bon Jovi to Lady Gaga. Perhaps one the most memorable celebrity supporters of Clinton’s campaign eight years ago was Beyoncé, who made a surprise appearance during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio. The superstar arrived onstage in a polka dot Givenchy pantsuit and a black sequinned collared shirt — something one could even imagine Harris wearing for an evening engagement today.
    

            It’s hard to picture Clinton signing off on a decision to have Megan Thee Stallion “shake cheeks,” as one fan on Instagram wrote, in a cropped suit at a rally. But in the age of TikTok, outfits have to be grabbier and performances more dramatic. While it’s safe to assume Harris’ will stick to her uniform, we might expect a constellation of fearless dressers to emerge around her — lending her some of their star power, and Gen Z appeal, along the way.

CNN_69,Meet the viral Olympians winning medals and hearts,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/viral-olympians-ilona-maher-fred-richard-cec/index.html,2024-08-01 02:05:00,world,"
            We met Simone Biles on the mat, Sha’Carri Richardson on the track and Katie Ledecky in the pool. Their achievements are so groundbreaking that they’ve become household names.
    

            But there are thousands of Olympians in Paris for the Summer Games, and most of them entered the Games relatively unknown — until the internet discovered them.
    

            More than a few Olympians from all over the world are becoming viral sensations, either for their funny and frank TikTok presences or their impeccably cool performances during the Olympics. Get to know some of this year’s breakout Olympic stars.
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Women’s rugby
    

            Though she’d never medaled at the Olympics until this year, Ilona Maher was already a Team USA favorite coming into the Paris Games for her TikTok presence. She’s reliably candid and silly on the app, and though she’s clearly having the time of her life with her women’s rugby teammates, she also routinely uses TikTok to refute cruel comments about her body.
    

            In one video filmed before the Olympics, another user attempted to insult her body by guessing her BMI, or body mass index, which is often an inaccurate measurement of body fat for people with a ton of muscle like Maher. She didn’t let the comment slide.
    

            “I’m five (feet) 10 (inches), 200 pounds and I have about, and this is an estimate, but about 170 pounds of lean mass on me,” she said in the video. “So yeah, I do have a BMI of 30, I am considered overweight. But alas, I’m going to the Olympics — and you’re not.”
    

            Newfound fame isn’t distracting her from the ultimate prize, though. Earlier this week, Maher helped lead the US women’s rugby team to their first-ever medal, bronze, in rugby sevens.
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Men’s gymnastics
    

            It’s no wonder that Fred Richard’s TikTok username is “FrederickFlips”: His amazing acrobatic skills are what most of his nearly 800,000 followers come to his page to see. Leading up to the Olympics, the gymnast shared breathtaking clips from training of himself flying through the air on the high bar.
    

            Flipping so quickly and with such discipline inspires nausea in most of us, but not Richard. In one of his more poignant clips, he shows how he’s progressed on the high bar since middle school. Even as a 12-year-old, he could out-flip most everyone on Earth. It’s a blast to watch him at his very first Games, earning a team medal (and thoroughly enjoying the bag of Skims loungewear that every member of Team USA received).
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Men’s gymnastics
    

            It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s — Stephen Nederoscik!
    

            The US men’s gymnastics team’s “pommel horse hero” earned Clark Kent comparisons for his bespectacled appearance on the sidelines as his teammates competed in multiple events during the team final. Nederoscik, meanwhile, only performs on the pommel horse. And for good reason: He’s the only American gymnast who’s made the Olympic team as a single-event athlete. Team USA’s Clark Kent is just that talented.
    

            While his teammates sweated and swung their bodies, Nederoscik closed his eyes and calmed himself down. When it came time for the pommel horse, Nederoscik, as the last man up, dropped the glasses and unleashed the beast. His near-perfect performance helped earn the US men’s gymnastics team its first medal in 16 years — and cemented Nederoscik as one of the Games’ first accidentally viral superstars.
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Diving
    

            Perhaps no one at Olympic Village is having more fun than Tyler Downs. The 21-year-old American diver is documenting his Olympics experience in its entirety, from scoping out attractive athletes at the Olympic dining hall to testing the durability of the infamous Olympic Village beds.
    

            He might also be the biggest “brat” in Paris: He’s performed the viral dance to Charli XCX’s “Apple” all around Paris, including in front of the Eiffel Tower during the Opening Ceremony from Team USA’s boat in the Seine.
    

            He’s never medaled at the Olympics before, but he’ll get his chance on Friday, with partner Greg Duncan at the men’s synchronized 3-meter springboard.
    

Team: South Korea
    

Sport: Shooting
    

            Few Olympians look cooler than Kim Yeji when she lifted her pistol, leaned back with her hand in her pocket and fired.
    

            Kim, at 31, is a first-time Olympian and unflappable sharp shooter. Her monochromatic black getup and tiny shooting glasses reminiscent of the eyewear in “The Matrix” cemented her as the Games’ premier fashion icon. But she’s got the goods to back up the immaculate style: Ahead of the Olympics, Kim set a record-breaking score at the women’s 25-meter pistol event
    

            And though she won the silver medal earlier this week in the 10-meter air pistol event, she was just thrilled to share the moment with her teammate Oh Ye-Jin.
    

            “When we won these medals, we were so proud we are Koreans,” Kim told the Associated Press after the event. “I thought it did not matter who won the gold.”
    

            A humble champion! Kim competes next in the 25-meter pistol qualifier, as her legions of new fans anxiously await her next show-stopping performance (and accompanying look).
    

Team: Norway
    

Sport: Swimming
    

            There are several couples in contention at the Paris Olympics, but the most surprising love story from the Games this year is between a man and many, many muffins.
    

            Henrik Christiansen’s Olympics-set TikToks have almost entirely revolved around his love affair with a double chocolate-chip muffin.
    

            Their relationship began when Christiansen sampled the muffin at the cafeteria and rated it 11/10, several points above the heartier meals athletes depend upon.
    

            And as the Games have continued, nothing can keep them apart. In nearly every video he’s made at the Games, the muffin is usually half-eaten, leaving a trail of melted chocolate smeared across Christiansen’s face. They’ve taken in the sunset together, shared discrete liaisons in the athletes’ quarters and toured Olympic Village — in one clip, Christiansen proudly struts through Paris with four chocolate muffins in hand.
    

            Christiansen’s relationship with the chocolate muffin turned sinister in a recent video, in which Christiansen cries and flails, his wrists and ankles bound and his mouth covered with duct tape, as the muffin sits in the foreground, unmoving.
    

            Will Christiansen eventually break the muffin’s chocolatey spell? We’re less than one week in to the Games, so there’s still time for their relationship to sour — or soar to even greater, sugarier heights.
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Artistic swimming
    

            You may know Daniella Ramirez best from the sound of her hair. Yes, the sound.
    

            The artistic swimmer basically glues her hair flat with so much gel that, when it’s dry, it forms an acrylic-like shell on top of her head — a method that’s great for keeping her hair in place in water sports but challenging to remove when the competition is over. It’s transfixing to watch her peel and crack her hair.
    

            And though Ramirez is a top athlete, she’s also a fan of the biggest stars on Team USA. When LeBron James and Coco Gauff, two of the best to ever play basketball and tennis, respectively, served as flag bearers for Team USA during the Opening Ceremony, Ramirez and her teammates were right behind them in the upper deck, holding their tiny American flags, too.
    

            “We’re matching his freak,” they said in a TikTok, subtly geeking out over James and Gauff before staring ahead at the Seine, flags in hand, as though they were flanking George Washington on the Delaware River.
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Men’s volleyball
    

            Shoji is the seasoned veteran among the viral Olympians: Paris is his third appearance at the Games, and he’s likely hungry for another medal (he last made it to the podium in Rio, earning bronze).
    

            Shoji is a libero, the team’s defensive specialist who supports from the back row of the volleyball court, but he’s the team’s best-known player on TikTok. Perhaps his most informative videos are his culinary reviews of the dining hall options — he’s discerning but gracious, often taking into consideration how many hungry athletes the Games have to feed.
    

            He even tried Christiansen’s favorite, the gooey chocolate muffin, and confirmed that the pastry really is “the best thing in the dining hall.”
    

Team: USA
    

Sport: Track and field
    

            Like every Olympian at the Games, runner Tara Davis-Woodhall is thrilled to be living her Olympic dreams — but she’s also keeping it very real about the unglamorous side of being an Olympian.
    

            “Olympic Village struggle part 773,000-400 bajillion,” she started in one video in which she compared the dorm clothing racks to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. “Nothing works!”
    

            Understandable complaints aside, there is an undeniably sweet element of Davis-Woodhall’s Olympic appearance: She’s sharing it with her husband, Hunter Woodhall, who’s a Paralympian and has earned three medals in track and field. The couple who runs together … medals together?

            Triumph and tragedy are everywhere you look at the Olympics, and the men’s BMX park final on Wednesday had a surfeit of both.
    

            For tragedy, see how the pre-competition favorites – Australia’s defending champion Logan Martin and France’s home favorite Anthony Jeanjean – were at various points left sprawled on the canvass following dramatic crashes, a brutal reminder of the sport’s do-or-die nature.
    

            Martin crashed on both of his runs, his title defense wilting in the Paris heat, while Jeanjean recovered superbly on his second run to take a hard-earned bronze medal.

            As for the triumph, take José Torres Gil, the Argentinian rider who won his country’s first individual gold medal in a cycling discipline with a stunning initial score of 94.82.
    

            “I couldn’t understand it, total craziness, it brought tears to my eyes,” was how Torres Gil explained hearing that he would be crowned Olympic champion at the Place de la Concorde, the temporary home of the Urban Sports Park.
    

            Great Britain’s Keiran Reilly took silver after packing trick after trick into his second run, hauling himself above Jeanjean with the final act of the competition. As he threw his bike across the boarded floor and dropped to his knees in exhaustion, you knew he had given all he could.
    

            “It was probably the best final that we’ve ever seen on the international stage,” said Jeanjean, whose score of 93.76 was enough to win gold at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
    

            The Frenchman received huge support throughout, both from fans packed inside the arena and those gathered on the outskirts, hoping to catch a glimpse of proceedings. But when he crashed out on the first trick of his first run – losing a shoe and gingerly getting back to his feet – the atmosphere in the stands instantly deflated.
    

            A rider is scored out of 100 based on the best of their two 60-second runs in an Olympic final, this the second time the freestyle format has appeared at the Games, and points are awarded based on several criteria, including the difficulty, variety, creativity and execution of their tricks.
    

            It offered Jeanjean a chance at redemption later in the competition, and when he ended his majestic second run by fist-pumping the air, slapping the ground and thumping his thighs, you sensed that he thought the gold medal was his.
    

            The crowd did, too, chanting Jeanjean’s name and flapping French tricolores in the air. Then came a second anti-climax as his score – just short of Torres Gil’s lead – appeared on the giant screen to a chorus of boos.
    

            “I’m a bit disappointed, I wasn’t coming for the bronze but for gold,” said Jeanjean, who was looking for redemption after crashing in Tokyo. “That’s how it works, I gave everything. I fell on the first run, that’s not easy to continue for the second. People here are all very strong, we are nine riders and the nine can win.
    

            “I am very happy to have this medal around my neck,” he added. “I will take time to digest after this failure because, to me, that’s a failure.”
    

            After the pain of his initial crash, the bronze medal was earned through a combination of resilience and skill on the 26-year-old’s second run, which ended on a stunning double backflip.
    

            “It’s not easy at all when you’ve been training day-in, day-out for a year and you fall on the first trick, the first run,” Jeanjean said. “I haven’t fallen at all, I haven’t fallen all week.
    

            “I had to get back on my feet and stay focused for my second run … despite a couple of mistakes, I’m glad I was able to pull it out the bag and get the medal on the second run.”
    

            Torres Gil’s gold medal was the first for a South American nation at these Games and, in his first Olympics, the 29-year-old added to the Pan American Games title he won last year.
    

            He was unfancied going into the final having qualified in seventh place with an average score of 86.66. That was behind Reilly, who qualified first, and the American duo of Marcus Christopher and Justin Dowell in second and fourth.
    

            Martin occupied the third qualifying spot and Jeanjean the fifth, but it was Torres Gil who rose to the occasion with a high-scoring first run, which would stand as the benchmark for most of the competition.
    

            Perhaps, though, that is part and parcel of the Olympics: where the unexpected can happen and the unfancied can become eternal.
    

            “The level was extraordinary,” he said in his press conference. “The best athletes of the planet were here in Paris. I competed against the best of the world and I felt incredible; I feel part of this incredible universe.”

CNN_71,Donald Trump falsely suggests Kamala Harris ‘happened to turn Black’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html,2024-08-01 03:35:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his 2024 Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, “happened to turn Black” a few years ago, saying that “all of a sudden, she made a turn” in her identity.
    

            Trump’s comments at a gathering of Black journalists in Chicago came when an interviewer asked him whether he agreed with Republicans on Capitol Hill who have characterized Harris as a “DEI hire.” Trump responded by questioning Harris’ heritage.
    

            “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” the former president said.
    

            “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a Black person,” he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. “I think somebody should look into that too.”
    

            Trump’s comments are reminiscent of his similar attacks on Black political rivals in the past, including the years he spent pushing the false, racist “birther” conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.
    

            Harris’ mother was Indian and her father is Jamaican; both immigrated to the United States. Harris was born in Oakland, California, and attended a historically Black university, Howard University, in Washington. She is the first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.
    

            Trump on Wednesday was interviewed by a panel that included ABC News’ Rachel Scott, Semafor’s Kadia Goba and Fox News’ Harris Faulkner.
    

            Scott began the interview by asking Trump: “You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former President Barack Obama, saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have told four congresswomen of color, who were American citizens, to go back to where they came from. You have used words like ‘animal’ and ‘rabid’ to describe Black district attorneys. You have attacked Black journalists, calling them a ‘loser,’ saying the questions they ask are, quote, ‘stupid’ and ‘racist.’ You’ve had dinner with a White supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. So my question, sir – now that you are asking Black supporters to vote for you, why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?”
    

            A combative Trump responded: “Well, first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question so – in such a horrible manner, first question. You don’t even say, ‘Hello. How are you?’”
    

            He asked Scott if she was with ABC, saying the network was “a fake news network” and “a terrible network.”
    

            “I think it’s disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the Black population of this country. I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country, including employment, including opportunity zones with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina,” the former president said. “I’ve done so much, and, you know, I say this: Historically Black colleges and universities were out of money, they were stone cold broke, and I saved them. I gave them long-term financing, and nobody else was doing it.”
    

            “It’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that,” Trump said.
    

            Scott asked if Trump found it acceptable that some Republicans on Capitol Hill have referred to Harris as a “DEI hire” – using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion.
    

            “I really don’t know. Could be. Could be,” he said.
    

            The former president also repeatedly criticized the organization for the event’s set-up, which he said made it difficult to hear other panelists and delayed the start of the event. A spokesperson for NABJ told CNN that technology issues had delayed the start.
    

            Trump in his remarks called himself “the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” a comment that drew audible groans from the journalists in attendance. He ignored a follow-up question about whether he was better than Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law.
    

            “I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,” he said. “For you to start off a question-and-answer period, especially when you’re 35 minutes late because you couldn’t get your equipment to work, I think it’s a disgrace. I really do, I think it’s a disgrace.”

CNN_72,White House says reports of Hamas leader’s assassination in Iran ‘don’t help with the temperature going down’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/biden-hamas-leader-killed-reax/index.html,2024-08-01 03:23:00,politics,"
            The White House on Wednesday said reports of the assassination of a Hamas political leader in Iran “don’t help with the temperature going down,” while repeating calls for a ceasefire deal that would see the release of hostages held by Hamas.
    

            “These reports over the last 24-48 hours certainly don’t help with the temperature going down. I’m not going to be Pollyannaish about it; we’re obviously concerned about escalation,” White House national security adviser John Kirby told reporters during the White House press briefing.
    

            While repeatedly declining to comment directly on the strike in Tehran, Kirby eventually acknowledged: “All of this adds to the complicated nature of what we’re trying to get done. And what we’re trying to get done is a ceasefire deal.”
    

            In the wake of the announcement of Ismail Haniyeh’s death, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with counterparts from two key allies, Qatar and Jordan. In both conversations, according to the State Department, the officials emphasized the need for a ceasefire in Gaza.
    

            But Haniyeh’s killing removes perhaps the most significant Hamas negotiator from the table at a critical time when US officials have said that a long-sought ceasefire deal is as close as it’s ever been.
    

            “Political assassinations [and] continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?,” Qatar’s prime minister, a principal mediator, wrote on X after news of Haniyeh’s death.
    

            The Qatari post amounted to a direct accusation of Israel, while US officials have shied away from confirming the suspected Israeli operation against Haniyeh.
    

            No parties have declared an end to the ceasefire talks but Haniyeh’s death has significantly chilled the prospects of an imminent agreement.
    

            “It’s too soon to know what impact any of this is going to have on the ceasefire deal,” Kirby said at the briefing.
    

            As recently as earlier this month, Haniyeh was discussing ideas for ending the war with mediators in Qatar and Egypt — conversations that sparked some hope that a framework for a deal was coming into view after months of war, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and plunged Gaza into a humanitarian catastrophe.
    

            His assassination is the most recent escalation that has broadened the scope of the war outside of Gaza and threatens to further draw in Iran and the United States.
    

            It follows a rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, which Israel blamed on Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, another Iran proxy. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the attack — the deadliest inside Israel since October 7.
    

            Israel responded with a drone strike in southern Beirut that killed Hezbollah’s most senior military official, Fu’ad Shukr. His killing had been considered the most serious escalation in the war, until the assassination of Haniyeh on Wednesday.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a televised statement on Wednesday that Israel has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies in the last few days.
    

            US officials had held out some optimism about a deal prior to the recent escalations. Late last month, Netanyahu signaled he was ready to make a “partial deal” with Hamas that would lead to the release of only some hostages, while still vowing that he would see the war out until the militant group is eliminated.
    

            While Netanyahu’s statement was at odds with a proposal outlined by President Joe Biden last month — a plan that would include the release of all hostages, Israeli troops withdrawing from Gaza and a permanent ceasefire — hopes that a deal could be reached carried over to Netanyahu’s visit to Washington last week. But during a fiery address to Congress, Netanyahu focused little attention on ongoing negotiations, instead vowing to “fight until we achieve victory” while falsely downplaying Israel’s role in the mounting civilian deaths in Gaza.
    

            The recent events could lead to further strain in Biden and Netanyahu’s decadeslong relationship. The president has said that Israel has already reached goals it had outlined after October 7, called the country’s actions in Gaza “over the top” and suggested that Netanyahu seeks to prolong the war only for the sake of his own political survival.
    

            Iran vowed to retaliate for the assassination on its soil.
    

            “You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, referring to Israel in a statement. “We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.”
    

            Iran’s foreign ministry blamed the United States directly “as a supporter and accomplice of the Zionist regime in the continuation of the occupation and genocide of the Palestinians, in committing this heinous act of terrorism.”
    

            Asked about the supreme leader’s response to the killing during Wednesday’s press briefing, Kirby responded: ”We have and will maintain a level of readiness to preserve our national security interest in the region.”

CNN_73,What to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyond,https://edition.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html,2024-08-01 03:14:00,politics,"
A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.
    

            Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.
    

            Nobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.
    

            So we don’t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:
    

            While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.
    

            Harris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN’s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.
    

            In late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.
    

            Earlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, turns 40. He’d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.
    

            Biden and Trump had agreed to a second debate, hosted by ABC News, to occur on September 10. But with Biden out of the race, Trump has suggested he might not take part in a debate sponsored by ABC. Instead, the Trump campaign suggested a debate on Fox News, and that network has suggested September 17.
    

            Both sides seem eager to debate, so look for details to emerge.
    

            The first early voting will also get underway in September. North Carolina is the first state to send mail-in ballots, on September 6, but other states will follow suit in the weeks after.
    

            Back in school and back to work, many Americans may start to pay more attention to the election in September. There will also be some touchstone moments in the cultural zeitgeist, such as when “Saturday Night Live” premiers at the end of the month with Maya Rudolph returning as Harris – and we find out who will play Vance.
    

            Trump also faces sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. That September 18 date could slip as the court reacts to new immunity granted to presidents by the Supreme Court.

            Election Day isn’t until November 5, but most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process will kick into overdrive in October.
    

            Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according to census figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
    

            The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.
    

            US law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.
    

            People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.
    

            Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.
    

            Toward the end of November, Biden turns 82.
    

            After questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.
    

            Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.
    

            The new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event of an Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.
    

            In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be the fifth vice president in history to oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.
    

            On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.

CNN_76,Health care worker convicted of accessing Justice Ginsburg’s health records as she battled cancer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/ginsburg-health-records-conviction/index.html,2024-08-01 04:57:00,politics,"
            A former health care worker was convicted Wednesday of illegally accessing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s medical records in 2019 as she was battling cancer, a move prosecutors claimed was driven by online conspiracy theories about her health.
    

            But the jury acquitted Trent Russell of a separate charge stemming from the posting of those records online. Prosecutors had claimed that Russell, a former Army medic who worked as an organ transplant coordinator, shared the documents on the message board site 4chan.
    

            The unusual case had political overtones as prosecutors painted Russell as engaging with conspiracy theories online that falsely claimed Ginsburg had already died in 2019 and that Democrats were hiding her death to deny former President Donald Trump a chance to nominate a third justice to the high court.
    

            The trial in a federal court in Virginia lasted two days, and the jury deliberated for four-and-a-half hours. Russell faces a maximum sentence of 21 years in prison.
    

            Ginsburg, a member of the court’s liberal wing who enjoyed an unusual degree of celebrity for a Supreme Court justice, died in 2020 and was replaced by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett before Trump left the White House.
    

            Russell denied ever accessing Ginsburg’s records, said he voted for former President Barack Obama in 2012, and claimed he rarely even thought about the justices – let alone engage in conspiracy theories about their health. Instead, he described a workplace where computer security was lax and the sharing of passwords needed to access medical records was routine.
    

            Russell had access to the records in the first place because of his job connecting patients who needed organs to potential donors. He was authorized to review health records in those situations to ensure potential donors were a good candidate.
    

            Supreme Court police noticed Ginsburg’s records circulating on social media sites and a subsequent FBI investigation determined that they were first posted on 4chan, a message board where users can post anonymously and that has long been a hotbed of hate speech and conspiracy theories.
    

            Search logs reviewed by investigators indicated that Russell was logged into a desktop computer at home and had searched for the word “Gins” in a name field that would have brought up Ginsburg’s name. A review of his hard drive by the FBI also found evidence that he had previously viewed threads about Ginsburg’s health on 4chan.
    

            But the hard drive had been reformatted and investigators were only able to pull fragments of its contents. Russell said he had no memory of the search and suggested it might have been a typo.
    

            Prosecutors also alleged that Russell tried to cover his tracks as initial investigations into the data breach got underway, including by wiping the hard drive and also purchasing a new phone. The jury also convicted him Wednesday on a charge of destroying records.
    

            Russell, who took the stand Tuesday in US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff’s courtroom, told the jury that he routinely reformatted his hard drive to improve computer performance. And he said he replaced the phone because of a cracked screen and intermittent charging.
    

            The Supreme Court closely guards details about the health of the justices, but Ginsburg’s repeated bouts with cancer toward the end of her life were publicly disclosed. The court announced that Ginsburg was treated for pancreatic cancer in 2009. And in 2020, the justice disclosed she had was being treated with chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer.

CNN_77,Pennsylvania county law enforcement officials say Secret Service is presenting a ‘misleading’ picture of Trump shooting scene,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/beaver-county-secret-service-trump-shooting-interview/index.html,2024-08-01 04:52:00,politics,"
            Pennsylvania law enforcement officials are accusing acting Secret Service Director Robert Rowe of “misleading the American people” by saying that local snipers at Donald Trump’s rally should have “looked left” and spotted would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks.
    

            Beaver County District Attorney Nate Bible and Det. Patrick Young, head of the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit, told CNN in an interview Wednesday that the Secret Service had not reached out to Beaver County’s snipers to speak to them before Rowe made his accusations at a nationally televised Senate hearing this week.
    

            “For the acting director to say that this is where our guys were, and this is what they’ve seen, is a misrepresentation to the American people,” Young said. “We were never asked what we’d seen or where we were from Secret Service. I can tell you that again – the pictures presented is again a misrepresentation.”

Takeaways from the Senate hearing on the Trump assassination attempt and Secret Service failure


            The Secret Service is falsely trying to blame other law enforcement agencies for the failure to stop Crooks, Bible alleged.
    

            “Before this incident, I would have thought Secret Service is, like bulletproof. I mean, you’re not getting within 50 yards of somebody important, even on foot, right, let alone, you know, a sniper or something,” Bible said. “It honestly seems like, you know, they don’t have answers, so they’re just sort of pointing fingers and passing the buck around.”
    

            Bible and Young said they are taking the criticisms from the Secret Service personally and warned that the trust between the law enforcement agencies has been fractured. Trump has said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, for another rally, but the county officials say they haven’t yet heard from the Secret Service or the campaign about any future plans.
    

            The Beaver County officials were part of a multi-jurisdictional team assisting the Secret Service for Trump’s July 13 rally.
    

            Rowe’s testimony – and photos he showed to lawmakers of the site – has further exacerbated the tensions between local law enforcement officials and the Secret Service have played out in the days since Crooks climbed onto a roof near the rally site and fired eight shots at Trump, injuring the former president and killing a rally attendee.
    

            The Secret Service has not responded to questions for comment from CNN.
    

            Asked if he could confidently say that something like this would not happen again at a future rally, Young said: “I cannot say that.”
    

            “At this point, me, along with the, I’m sure, the majority of the American people, have many questions as to what and how the Secret Service does their job,” Young said. “And I would have never said that before this week really, with testimony, because the Secret Service has not acknowledged – for everything that they say that they did wrong, there’s a ‘but’ – and that but follow is usually assigning blame to the local law enforcement or state police.”
    

            The Secret Service declined to comment.
    

            A federal law enforcement official familiar with the matter said the Secret Service was and has been in touch with the lead for the Butler Emergency Services Unit, which oversaw the Beaver County local law enforcement officers and others that day.
    

            The official also said that the counter sniper team was able to take pictures of Crooks on the ground prior to his climbing on the roof and questioned why screens on a window would prevent SWAT team members from looking for a suspicious individual at a rally with the former president.
    

            During Tuesday’s Senate hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the Butler rally, saying that information about Crooks was “siloed” and “stuck” in local law enforcement channels.
    

            He also said that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof – claims that the Beaver County officials dispute.
    

            “I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that’s where they were posted,” Rowe told senators, displaying pictures the Secret Service took in a re-staging of the scene. “Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?”
    

            But Young asserted that the photos Rowe displayed at the hearing could not accurately capture the vantage point of the snipers positioned in the AGR building.
    

            The snipers had been instructed to be covert, meaning they could not stick their heads out the window to see Crooks, Young said.
    

            The photo the Secret Service used to show its viewpoint was taken through of a window that had been secured and closed during the rally, only opened after the shooting had taken place, according to Young.
    

            “Where our people were was the far-right side of the AGR building. Their views in no way could have seen Crooks without pushing their heads outside the window and looking back,” Young said. “The videos and the exhibits presented to Congress are purely wrong as to what they’d actually seen.”
    

            Young and Bible said they are speaking out both to correct misinformation that has come out in the days since the shooting – such as false claims that the snipers were positioned inside the building because it was too hot to be on the roof – and to combat public statements that have thrown local law enforcement under the bus.
    

            “It’s extremely misleading to the American people. I mean, it makes our guys look incompetent to me to say, ‘Oh, well, all you had to do is just turn your head to the left, and you would have saw this,’” Bible said. “My reaction was, I was a little fired up.”
    

            Bible added that there were screens on the windows where their snipers were stationed in order to keep them hidden. The muzzles of the guns were about a foot behind the window, Young said, and the snipers were about three feet back, observing through the window with binoculars.
    

            “The screens were allowed to be in place because then it allowed us to shoot through, but would not allow people to see in,” he said.
    

            “What they were instructed to do was focus on the secured area in front of you – so, before you went in through security, immediately after, before the stage. Watch those individuals – make sure nobody snuck something past security,” Bible said. “Not to look at the outer unsecured area where Crooks was. And so even if that was their job, in that position, they couldn’t have seen it. They would have had to been outside that window.”
    

            One of the Beaver County snipers took a photo of Crooks before the shooting that was shared on a text chain with other local snipers. Young said that the sniper called in what he had seen to his command through the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, though he did not know if that information was ever relayed to the Secret Service.
    

            “I can’t attest to who was in that command center or what visibility Secret Service would have had at that point,” Young said.
    

            One Beaver County sniper, Greg Nicol, left his post to search for Crooks through other windows in the building, Young said, though he added said that the Butler County sniper there remained at the post, unlike what had been suggested in prior testimony.
    

            Bible credited Nicol with potentially saving lives at the rally because of his early identification of Crooks being suspicious, taking a picture of him through a screened window and sending it around.
    

            “If it wasn’t for Greg Nicol identifying Crooks, so early on, that is what allowed the Secret Service sniper to immediately take him out,” Bible said. “You know, he did get eight shots off, but otherwise, he may potentially could have unloaded a couple clips before they knew where this guy was.”

CNN_78,Nicolae Miu sentenced to 20 years in prison in Wisconsin river stabbing incident that left one teen dead,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/nicolae-miu-sentencing-wisconsin-river-stabbing/index.html,2024-08-01 04:48:00,us,"
            Nicolae Miu, who was convicted of stabbing five people, one fatally, during a 2022 tubing excursion along the Apple River in Wisconsin, was sentenced to 20 years in prison Wednesday.
    

            Miu, 54, was found guilty in April of first-degree reckless homicide in the death of 17-year-old Isaac Schuman. He was also convicted of battery and recklessly endangering safety with an aggravated factor of the use of a dangerous weapon in connection with the wounded victims: A.J. Martin, Dante Carlson, Tony Carlson and Rhyley Mattison.
    

            “(Miu) left the scene, leaving his victims to die while casually floating past them and emergency workers as if nothing had happened,” St. Croix County District Judge R. Michael Waterman said while handing down the sentence, which came just after the two-year anniversary of the attack.
    

            In addition to the 20-year prison sentence, Miu was sentenced to six years of extended supervision. He was given 732 days credit for time served. His defense attorney, Aaron Nelson, said Miu will be about 72 years old when he is eligible for release.
    

            Authorities said Miu was tubing on the river with his wife and friends near Somerset, Wisconsin, on July 30, 2022, when they were separated as he was searching for a lost cell phone. He came upon the victims while looking for the phone, “as he believed they’d located something.”
    

             In the subsequent altercation, Miu stabbed the five victims and punched a woman in the face.
    

            Miu told investigators he felt threatened and “fearful” when confronted by the victims, who he said taunted him, according to a 2022 criminal complaint. He said he stabbed them in self-defense after they threw his snorkeling gear in the water, attempted to pull down his bathing suit and called him a “child molester,” the complaint said.

            Witnesses described seeing Miu brandish a “three-inch silver” knife when two females confronted him before a physical altercation broke out, the complaint stated.
    

            One victim told investigators she was punched by Miu in the face, which gave way to a physical struggle as a male punched Miu and the group then pushed Miu, who fell into the water. Miu said he couldn’t remember anything after people hit him and got on top of him until he ran back to his wife, according to the complaint.
    

            The complaint noted Miu said he did not immediately tell his wife and friends what had occurred as he thought the group of kids were “too drunk” and “too set on going after people,” and Mui didn’t want the two groups to confront one another.
    

            Miu was arrested an hour-and-a-half after the incident.
    

            “The court’s sentence must reflect the reality that it was reckless conduct that the jury found him guilty of, not intentional conduct, which is punishable much more harshly,” the judge said Wednesday.
    

            Miu was originally charged with first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree intentional attempted homicide.


            St. Croix County District Attorney Karl Anderson had told Waterman he shouldn’t believe Miu is a fundamentally passive person, despite his lack of previous criminal history. “A peaceful person doesn’t take out a knife when they could have just walked away,” said Anderson.
    

            Nelson, the defense attorney, had argued Miu should be seen as a decent person who made a terrible mistake, saying: “Mr. Miu was – is – a good man.”
    

            Miu remained stoic for most of the hearing, looking down throughout. He looked up only to read a statement to the victims’ families.
    

            “I never meant for this tragedy to occur. My soul is broken,” said Miu. “My heart is very heavy, and I will never be the same carrying such a heavy burden inside.”
    

            Miu turned to the families and cried as he said, “I’m very sorry.”
    

            Isaac’s father, Scott Schuman, said after the hearing he was happy Miu apologized. “I still need to process that,” he said. “But I didn’t expect it, and I was happy that he did that.”

CNN_79,Instagram just permanently zapped some people’s photos,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/tech/instagram-story-archives-deletion/index.html,2024-08-01 04:36:00,us,"
            Some Instagram posters got a shocking notification from the app Wednesday: Certain photos have been permanently deleted from the app’s Stories archives, unable to be recovered.
    

            “This story is no longer available,” some users saw on certain Stories. “Due to a technical issue, this story is no longer available. While we’ve since fixed this issue, your story can’t be restored.”
    

            Meta, which owns Instagram, declined to share how many users were affected, but said only the people whose Stories were lost will see the notice.
    

            “We found and fixed a bug that caused some people’s Story highlights and archives to be deleted. Unfortunately, we are unable to restore these Stories and we’re letting people know in the app if they’re impacted,” a Meta spokesperson said Wednesday.
    

            Meta said the black screen showing the error message would be gone by July 2025.
    

            Instagram Stories are a more casual, less committing form of posting. Users can upload photos, videos or text posts that disappear in 24 hours. More exclusive content can go on a curated Close Friends list or can permanently be placed on your profile as a story highlight.
    

            Stories differ from normal pictures, as they’re often personalized with music, gifs, text, filters and interactive features like polls. Many users treat their Story Archives as a photo diary — ranging from memes, screenshots of Spotify songs to show off music taste, to chill poolside photos from a beach vacation. Instagram even shows “memories” in the archives tab, pulling up an old story from what the user did on that day from past years. Some people also use Story Archives as a way to store pictures and videos.
    

            Instagram doesn’t automatically save stories to your camera roll — instead, they are auto uploaded to the Story Archives, which is what the bug affected along with the Story Highlights.
    

            The bug serves as another reminder that relying on a single backup method for media can be a bad idea. For important memories, people should ensure they back up photos, videos and other media outside of an app, no matter how trustworthy the company may be.

CNN_80,Key takeaways from the latest Fed meeting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/economy/july-fed-meeting-preview/index.html,2024-08-01 04:19:00,us,"
            The Federal Reserve gave an important clue Wednesday that it will likely cut its benchmark lending rate in the coming months.
    

            The move would pave the way for lower borrowing costs for Americans on everything from mortgages and car loans to credit cards. While the central bank said it will continue to hold rates at current levels, Fed officials are now wary of any risks surrounding America’s labor market, which has long been a pillar of strength for the economy, according to their latest policy statement.
    

            Fed Chair Jerome Powell talked up inflation’s recent progress in his post-meeting news conference, saying “the second quarter’s inflation readings have added to our confidence, and more good data would further strengthen that confidence.” He also conveyed that since the job market seems to be back to a pre-pandemic normal, any additional cooling could be concerning for the Fed.

Fed opts to hold interest rates steady — but a cut could be coming in September


            The Fed’s latest policy statement also suggested that officials view inflation as less of an issue now than at their June meeting. This shift in how the Fed is viewing the economy means the central bank could begin paring back interest rates as soon as its next policy meeting, in September, easing pressure on US households and businesses burdened by tough borrowing costs.
    

            Powell doubled down on his point that determining when to cut rates will be “a very difficult judgement call.” There are consequences both if the Fed cuts too soon, and if it cuts too late.
    

            Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently cautioned of the effects of inflation-adjusted interest rates, which tighten their grip on the economy if inflation slows but rates remain unchanged. That could be a problem for the labor market, which seems to be at an inflection point. In addition to stabilizing prices, the Fed is also responsible for maximizing employment.
    

            Here are key takeaways from the Fed’s latest meeting, news conference and policy statement.
    

            It’s crucial for the Fed’s top policymaker to sound confident about inflation before the central bank can begin cutting interest rates, and confident he sounded.

            Powell said “inflation has eased notably over the past few years, but remains somewhat elevated from our longer run goal of 2%.” The Fed’s statement also described inflation as “somewhat” elevated, which wasn’t a word that had been used before to describe inflation since the Fed began to lift rates in early 2022. The Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, showed that consumer prices were up 2.5% in June from a year earlier, down from May’s 2.6% annual rate, inching closer to the Fed’s 2% target.
    

            The Fed is still very much wary about inflation, but a bit less so now. Powell even said that “we don’t need to be 100% focused on inflation.” Indeed, the second quarter really gave Fed officials a huge relief.
    

            That wasn’t just because inflation resumed a downward trend, but also because economic growth remained solid. The government’s latest report on gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a robust 2.8% annualized rate from April through June, after adjusting for seasonal swings and inflation, which was double the rate seen in the first quarter and well above economists’ predictions. Powell called that a “historically unusual” development.
    

            “This is such a welcome outcome for the people we serve,” Powell said. “What we’re thinking about all the time is, how do we keep this going? And this is part of that.”
    

            The future of the job market is now top of mind for the Fed.
    

            Employers aren’t hiring at the same pace they have in recent years, it’s become a lot tougher for unemployed Americans to find a new job, demand for labor has tumbled dramatically over the past two years, wage growth is running at a cooler pace and the unemployment rate is now at its highest point in more than two years, at 4.1%. The Fed is responsible for keeping the labor market intact.

            Powell described that slower momentum as an “ongoing gradual normalization,” considering the job market was once running red-hot after it rebounded mightily from the pandemic-induced recession in 2020. But he noted that any significant weakening would be concerning since the job market is “back to where it was on the eve of the pandemic,” he said.
    

            “I wouldn’t say we don’t want to see any other cooling; it would have to be a material difference: If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would have the intention of responding to,” he said. “I think we’re in a good place here.”
    

            The Labor Department releases July data gauging the state of the US job market, including monthly payroll growth and the unemployment rate, on Friday.
    

            It’s not clear if the duo of slower inflation and stronger growth will persist. The Fed tries to wrangle inflation by deliberately cooling the economy through higher interest rates, so the latest GDP report went against that conventional wisdom.

            Powell said it’s highly unclear how the economy will unfold, adding that effects from the Covid-19 pandemic have undermined conventional wisdom, but he said “history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
    

            Plus, it’s already been a year that interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high, and there have been some signs of weakness in the broader economy. For starters, the US consumer is no longer splurging, and shoppers have instead become much more careful with their dollars, according to major retailers such as Target and Walmart. Americans are still very much spending, but they’re now hunting for bargains and prioritizing in-person experiences.
    

            In theory, American shoppers should be tapping out soon, which could spell trouble for the job market. However, last year, the economy’s sheer resilience shocked economists who widely expected a recession, which never happened.

CNN_81,Delta CEO lashes out at CrowdStrike: This cost us $500 million and they offered us nothing,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/business/delta-meltdown-costs/index.html,2024-08-01 04:01:00,us,"
            The CEO of Delta Air Lines lashed out at cyber security firm CrowdStrike and software provider Microsoft for the computer problems that resulted in a five-day service meltdown he said cost the airline $500 million.
    

            “They haven’t offered us anything. Free consulting advice to help us,” said Ed Bastian in an interview Wednesday on CNBC, when asked about how much compensation CrowdStrike and Microsoft have offered the company. And he blasted CrowdStrike for the flawed software update at Delta and hundreds of other companies around the globe that caused widespread computer outages on July 19.
    

            “If you’re going to have priority access to the Delta ecosystem in terms of technology, you’ve got to test this stuff,” Bastian said. “You can’t come into a mission critical 24/7 operation and tell us we have a bug. It doesn’t work.”
    

            The computer problems at Delta knocked its crucial crew tracking system off line for the better part of a week, making it impossible for the company to find pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its aircraft. While other airlines were quick to resume normal operations after the CrowdStrike outage, Delta was forced to cancel about 30% of its schedule over five days, leaving an estimated half-million passengers stranded. It took many days after that to re-book affected passengers on other flights and return their checked bags.

Delta passengers are angry, but will be back. They have little choice


            Delta has yet to file a lawsuit against either CrowdStrike or Microsoft, but a person familiar with its actions confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that it had hired the law firm of high-profile attorney David Boies to pursue compensation from the two companies. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A CrowdStrike spokesperson would only say, “We are aware of the reporting, but have no knowledge of a lawsuit and have no further comment.”
    

            “We have no choice,” Bastian told CNBC. “We have to protect our shareholders, we have to protect our customers (and) our employees for the damage, not just the cost but the reputational damage.”
    

            He said beyond the lost revenue from having to cancel about 6,300 flights in the five days, the company paid tens of millions a day in compensation to customers for hotels and other out-of-pocket expenses.
    

            When it was suggested that $500 million in compensation could put a company like CrowdStrike out of business, Bastian replied, “We’re not looking to wipe them out, but we’re looking to see we get compensated.”
    

            A CrowdStrike spokesperson said that the company ended its most recent quarter with $3.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The company also has a $750 million revolving credit line, as well as insurance policies which are intended to mitigate the potential impact of any legal claims.
    

            Bastian gave the interview to CNBC from Paris, which he traveled to a week ago to attend the Olympics as the airline was returning to a more normal flight schedule. Delta is a sponsor and the official airline of the US Olympic team, and CNBC’s NBC parent has the US broadcast rights to the games.

            The US women’s soccer team qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games with an unbeaten record after its 2-1 victory over Australia on Wednesday.
    

            Trinity Rodman opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time, prodding home as she latched onto a header from her teammate, Sophia Smith.
    

            Korbin Albert’s emphatic goal from long range doubled the US’ lead midway through the second half and, although Alanna Kennedy’s late goal did give Australia some hope, it was too little, too late as the Americans were able to hold onto the victory.
    

            The US was victorious in all three of its group games, allowing it to book its spot in the next round as Group B winner with nine points from nine available.
    

            The US women’s national team will face Japan in the next round.
    

            The USWNT has historically been one of the most dominant soccer teams at the Olympics ever since it made its debut back in 1996.
    

            Four gold medals in five Games – including a three-peat from 2004 to 2012 – cemented the US at the top of the pecking order in the women’s competition.
    

            But it has been unable to reach those lofty heights of late with no gold medal since 2012, losing in the quarterfinals to Sweden in 2016 and winning the bronze medal in Tokyo three years ago. It also lost in the round of 16 of last year’s World Cup after having won back-to-back titles in 2015 and 2019.
    

            At the 2024 Paris Olympics, though, it is a case of hope renewed under head coach Emma Hayes who is taking charge of the team for the first time at a major tournament at the Summer Games.
    

            Hayes’ side won its opening two games of the group stages, scoring seven goals and conceding just once as it booked its spot in the next round with a match to spare.
    

            A big part of the team’s success has been the team’s attacking line comprised of Smith, Mallory Swanson and Rodman who had scored or assisted on all seven of the USWNT’s goals this Olympics heading into Wednesday night.
    

            And Smith and Rodman once again combined for the US’s opening goal on Wednesday, with Smith heading down to allow Rodman to poke home.
    

            The US was the more dominant of the two sides, with Horan coming close with a close-range header that was tipped onto the bar.
    

            But for all the possession It had, the US couldn’t find a way to extend its lead. That was until substitute Albert picked up the ball a few yards from the edge of the box and smashed the ball into the top corner.
    

            The victory looked all but assured until a 91st minute goal from Alanna Kennedy halved the deficit and sparked life into the match – particularly given what the Matildas accomplished against Zambia, turning around a massive deficit to win a 6-5 thriller in the 90th minute.
    

            But the US was able to hold on and maintain its 100% winning record and its spot as Group B winner.
    

            The only downside of the evening came in the fourth minute when midfielder metronome Sam Coffey picked up an early yellow card which will rule her out of her team’s game in the quarterfinals.

CNN_83,Exclusive: How Samuel Alito got canceled from the Supreme Court social media majority,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/samuel-alito-supreme-court-netchoice-social-media-biskupic/index.html,2024-08-01 05:40:00,politics,"
            The hardline approach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito takes usually gets him what he wants.
    

            This year it backfired.
    

            Behind the scenes, the conservative justice sought to put a thumb on the scale for states trying to restrict how social media companies filter content. His tactics could have led to a major change in how platforms operate.
    

            CNN has learned, however, that Alito went too far for two justices – Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson – who abandoned the precarious 5-4 majority and left Alito on the losing side.

            As a result, the final 6-3 ruling led by Justice Elena Kagan backed the First Amendment rights of social media companies


            It is rare that a justice tapped to write the majority opinion loses it in ensuing weeks, but sources tell CNN that it happened twice this year to Alito. He also lost the majority as he was writing the decision in the case of a Texas councilwoman who said she was arrested in retaliation for criticizing the city manager.
    

            Alito has long given off an air of vexation, even as he is regularly in the majority with his conservative ideology. But the frustration of the 74-year-old justice has grown increasingly palpable in the courtroom. He has seldom faced this level of internal opposition.
    

            Overall, Alito wrote the fewest leading opinions for the court this term, only four, while other justices close to his 18-year seniority had been assigned (and kept majorities for) seven opinions each.

            His unique year in chambers was matched by the extraordinary public scrutiny for his off-bench activities, including lingering ethics controversies and a newly reported episode regarding an upside-down flag that had flown at this home in January 2021, after the pro-Donald Trump attack on the US Capitol. Some of the rioters waved inverted flags that became a symbol of Trump’s protest of the election results giving Joe Biden the presidency.
    

            After The New York Times reported on the flag in May, Democratic members of Congress called for Alito to recuse himself in Trump-related cases. Alito declined, in a letter that explained that his wife had hung the inverted flag in response to a nasty confrontation with a neighbor.
    

            Alito declined CNN requests for an interview.
    

            This exclusive series on the Supreme Court is based on CNN sources inside and outside the court with knowledge of the deliberations.
    

            The Texas and Florida disputes grew from conservative claims that their viewpoints were being censored online by Facebook, Twitter (now known as X) and other platforms.
    

            The states enacted their laws in 2021 and, with variations, restricted the ability of social media platforms to filter third-party messages, videos and other content. The laws were passed a few months after Facebook and Twitter removed Trump from their platforms, in the wake of the Capitol attack. 


            When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed that state’s measure, he said, “there is a dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas.” In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared in a statement, “If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable.”
    

            NetChoice, an internet trade association, brought lawsuits in both states, saying the laws broadly violated the First Amendment rights of social media companies. US district court judges in Florida and Texas temporarily blocked the laws from taking effect.
    

            As Texas appealed, the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, known for its own right-wing streak, said the platforms’ content-moderation activities did not rise to “speech” that would be protected by the First Amendment.
    

            US appellate Judge Andrew Oldham, a former Alito clerk, belittled the “large, well-heeled corporations that have hired an armada of attorneys from some of the best law firms in the world to protect their censorship rights.”
    

            The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruling on the Florida law, took the opposite tack and declared that content moderation implicated the First Amendment and protections for “editorial discretion.” Writing that decision, US appellate Judge Kevin Newsom said, “‘content-moderation’ decisions constitute protected exercises of editorial judgment.”
    

            (Newsom and Oldham were both appointed by Trump, who also has often complained of online censorship.)
    

            When the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the paired appeals on February 26, the justices struggled with multiple threshold issues, including how the laws might apply to typical social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, as well as to sites and apps like Etsy and Uber. NetChoice had brought a broadscale challenge, arguing that the laws were unconstitutional in all situations, rather than pointing to specific cases where free-speech rights were violated.
    

            A few days later, as the justices met in private on the dispute, they all agreed that NetChoice’s sweeping claims of unconstitutionality had fallen short and that the two cases should be sent back to the lower courts for further hearings.
    

            The justices, however, split over which lower court largely had the better approach to the First Amendment and what guidance should be offered for lower courts’ further proceedings.
    

            Alito, while receptive to the 5th Circuit’s opinion minimizing the companies’ speech interests, emphasized the incompleteness of the record and the need to remand the cases. Joining him were fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch and, to some extent, Barrett and Jackson.
    

            On the other side was Kagan, leaning toward the 11th Circuit’s approach. She wanted to clarify the First Amendment implications when states try to control how platforms filter messages and videos posted by their users. She was generally joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Brett Kavanaugh.
    

            Alito began writing the court’s opinion for the dominant five-member bloc, and Kagan for the remaining four.
    

            But when Alito sent his draft opinion around to colleagues several weeks later, his majority began to crumble. He questioned whether any of the platforms’ content-moderation could be considered “expressive” activity under the First Amendment.
    

            Barrett, a crucial vote as the case played out, believed some choices regarding content indeed reflected editorial judgments protected by the First Amendment. She became persuaded by Kagan, but she also wanted to draw lines between the varying types of algorithms platforms use.
    

            “A function qualifies for First Amendment protection only if it is inherently expressive,” Barrett wrote in a concurring statement, asserting that if platform employees create an algorithm that identifies and deletes information, the First Amendment protects that exercise of editorial judgment. That might not be the situation, Barrett said, for algorithms that automatically present content aimed at users’ preferences.
    

            Kagan added a footnote to her majority opinion buttressing that point and reinforcing Barrett’s view. Kagan wrote that the court was not dealing “with feeds whose algorithms respond solely to how users act online – giving them the content they appear to want, without any regard to independent content standards.”
    

            Jackson then joined much of Kagan’s analysis as well, including that a private company’s collection of third-party content for its platform could itself be expressive and therefore subject to First Amendment considerations when a state attempts to regulate. She added in a concurring statement, “Not every potential action taken by a social media company will qualify as expression protected under the First Amendment.”
    

            In Kagan’s opinion for the majority, she wrote, “Deciding on the third-party speech that will be included in or excluded from a compilation—and then organizing and presenting the included items—is expressive activity of its own. And that activity results in a distinctive expressive product.”
    

            “When the government interferes with such editorial choices—say, by ordering the excluded to be included— it alters the content of the compilation,” Kagan added. “And in so doing—in overriding a private party’s expressive choices—the government confronts the First Amendment.”
    

            Plainly irked by the turn of events, Alito wrote in his final concurring opinion that Kagan’s First Amendment pronouncements amounted only to “nonbinding dicta” that lower courts need not follow.

            Such lines between core principles of a decision, or mere dicta, are often fuzzy and the source of disagreement among lower court judges – and even the justices themselves. But, despite Alito’s protest, Kagan had a majority signing her decision, which, at minimum, offers lower court judges a strong indication of the framework the high court majority would use in future online challenges.
    

            Alito had the backing of only two justices in the end, Thomas and Gorsuch. He expressed sympathy for state efforts to restrict what, in an earlier phase of the Texas case Alito called “the power of dominant social media corporations to shape public discussion of the important issues of the day.”
    

            In his separate July 1 opinion for a minority, Alito pointed up why states might want to regulate how platforms filter content: “Deleting the account of an elected official or candidate for public office may seriously impair that individual’s efforts to reach constituents or voters, as well as the ability of voters to make a fully informed electoral choice. And what platforms call ‘content moderation’ of the news or user comments on public affairs can have a substantial effect on popular views.”
    

            Like Oldham, Alito took jabs at the “sophisticated counsel” who challenged the state regulations.
    

            With the Supreme Court having ruled, lower court judges now must explore the scope of the laws on the functions of various platforms, websites and apps. Litigation on this issue will surely continue and someday return to the Supreme Court.
    

            The give and take among the justices in the social media cases took until the very last day of the term. A few weeks before then, the separate majority Alito had tentatively won in the dispute over an alleged retaliatory arrest in Texas fell apart because of how extensively he wanted the court to rule.
    

            The case was brought by Sylvia Gonzalez, a former Castle Hills councilwoman who sued the mayor after she was arrested for removing a public document at a meeting. She said the arrest was in retaliation for speaking out against the city manager and noted that no one else had ever been arrested in such a situation.

            The 5th Circuit rejected Gonzalez’s claim, emphasizing that officers had probable cause to arrest her. Gonzalez, the appeals court had ruled, did not qualify for an exception to the wide deference courts give officers who have probable cause because she failed to demonstrate police had declined to make arrests in similar situations.
    

            When the justices voted on the case in March, the majority agreed that the 5th Circuit erred in the standard it used. Alito was assigned the opinion.
    

            But as he began writing, he went further than the other justices in his review of Gonzalez’s case. Alito and his colleagues realized he couldn’t “hold five,” as the expression goes, for a majority.
    

            A new majority agreed to dispatch the case with a limited rationale in unsigned opinion. Rejecting the 5th Circuit’s reasoning, the Supreme Court said the 5th Circuit had applied an “overly cramped view” of the court’s precedent for when people may sue for First Amendment retaliation claims. The high court noted that Gonzalez could not show evidence of whether officers handled similar situations differently because her situation, involving the alleged removal of a document, was exceedingly rare.
    

            The court’s narrow opinion did not suggest how Gonzalez would ultimately fare as she continued the lawsuit.
    

            Alito, in what became a concurring statement signed by him alone, agreed that the 5th Circuit had taken “an unduly narrow view,” but his opinion went further to detail Gonzalez’s actions and explore weaknesses in her varied arguments. Alito’s 16-page concurring opinion would have made it more difficult for Gonzalez to press her range of claims than the five-page opinion that garnered the new majority.

            On June 20, when the chief justice announced the opinion in Gonzalez v. Trevino, Alito’s chair at the bench was empty. Alito missed that day, as a total four opinions were handed down, and the next, June 21, when the justices released five other opinions.
    

            Justices sometimes skip one of these final days of the annual session, but usually there’s an obvious reason for the absence, such as travel to a previously scheduled speech. Court officials declined to provide any explanation.
    

            Alito returned for the final four announcement days of the term, yet sometimes appeared preoccupied. On the last day, when Kagan announced the decision in the NetChoice case, Alito was reading through material he had brought along to the bench.
    

            Alito appeared weary of it all by that last day. At 74, he is the second oldest of the current nine, after 76-year-old Thomas. While Alito is still relatively young as far as justices go (most in recent years haven’t left the bench until their 80s), he has reflected in private about retirement.
    

            If Republican Trump were to win Alito may be persuaded to step down. If he does, Trump could look to the 5th Circuit, where many of his most conservative appellate-bench choices from his first term sit, including Alito’s former clerk, Judge Oldham.

CNN_85,White woman who wrongfully accused ‘Groveland Four’ of rape in Jim Crow-era South dies at 92,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/us/groveland-four-jim-crow-exonerated/index.html,2024-08-01 05:16:00,us,"
            A White woman who falsely accused four Black men of rape in the Jim Crow-era South in 1949 has died at the age of 92.
    

            Norma Padgett Upshaw claimed the four men – Ernest Thomas, Samuel Shepherd, Charles Greenlee and Walter Irvin – sexually assaulted her in Groveland, Florida, about 30 miles west of Orlando, when she was 17. The group, who came to be called the “Groveland Four,” became the faces of the case considered one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in Jim Crow-era Florida.
    

            Padgett Upshaw died of natural causes on July 12 in Taylor County, Georgia, according to records filed at the probate court. The Washington Post was first to report her death.
    

            There were doubts about Padgett Upshaw’s testimony from the onset, but in the era of Jim Crow, a jury convicted the men without evidence of a crime. Circuit Court Judge Heidi Davis in Lake County, Florida, granted the state’s motion in November 2021 to posthumously dismiss the indictments against Thomas and Shepherd and vacated the convictions of Greenlee and Irvin.
    

            In 2019, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued full posthumous pardons to the Groveland Four.
    

            “For seventy years, these four men have had their history wrongly written for crimes they did not commit. As I have said before, while that is a long time to wait, it is never too late to do the right thing,” DeSantis said in the statement at the time.
    

            Padgett Upshaw claimed her car broke down on the night of July 16, 1949, in Groveland, and said the four men stopped and raped her.
    

            After being arrested, Shepherd, Greenlee and Irvin were tortured until police were able to elicit a confession from two of them. Thomas managed to escape custody and was killed after a manhunt.
    

            Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison.
    

            Shepherd and Irvin received the death penalty. While being transported from county jail for a retrial, the sheriff shot them both and claimed self-defense. Shepherd died at the scene and Irvin survived by playing dead. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison.
    

            After the court hearing during which the judge officially exonerated the four men in 2021, Greenlee’s daughter Carol Greenlee stood in front of cameras at an emotional news conference.
    

            “I would not hate, but I will love and embrace all of those who did not know at the time that my father was a caring and loving and compassionate person that did not rape anybody. I stand here today to say thank you,” she said.

CNN_86,Man convicted on lesser charges in stabbings at Wisconsin river,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/12/us/nicolae-miu-convicted-on-lesser-chargers-in-stabbings-at-wisconsin-river/index.html,2024-08-01 05:04:00,us,"
            A man charged with stabbing five people during a July 2022 river tubing excursion in Wisconsin has been found guilty on lesser charges.
    

            Nicolae Miu, 54, was convicted in state court on Thursday of first-degree reckless homicide in the death of 17-year-old Isaac Schuman near the Apple River. He was also convicted of four counts of recklessly endangering safety and one count of battery.
    

            Miu originally faced the more serious charges of first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree intentional attempted homicide.
    

            In addition to fatally stabbing Schuman, Miu was convicted of wounding A.J. Martin, Dante Carlson, Tony Carlson and Rhyley Mattison, along with punching Madison Coen in the face.
    

            The attack started with an “unanticipated random encounter” between Miu and the victims, according to the criminal complaint. Miu told investigators he stabbed the victims in self-defense after they stole his property and attacked him. Miu was arrested an hour-and-a-half later.
    

            “We’re relieved with the verdict,” said St. Croix County District Attorney Karl Anderson. “As anyone can see in this case, it’s absolutely tragic at so many levels.”
    

            Miu’s defense attorney, Aaron Nelson, said he was “surprised, respectfully disappointed” by the verdict.
    

            Miu’s bond was revoked after the guilty verdicts. A date for sentencing was not set on Thursday.
    

            Authorities said Miu was tubing on the river with his wife and friends when they were separated as he was searching for a lost cell phone.
    

            The original criminal complaint stated Miu had brandished a knife when two females confronted him before a physical altercation broke out.
    

            One victim told investigators she was punched by Miu in the face, which gave way to a physical struggle as a male punched Miu and the group then pushed Miu, who fell into the water. Miu said he couldn’t remember anything after people hit him and got on top of him until he ran back to his wife, according to the complaint.
    

Correction: A previous version of this story had an incorrect last name for the victim. His name was Isaac Schuman.

CNN_88,US Army Captain becomes first female nurse to graduate from the Army’s elite Ranger Course,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/us-army-captain-ranger-female-nurse/index.html,2024-08-01 06:00:00,us,"
            For US Army Capt. Molly Murphy, the hardest part of the Army’s grueling Ranger Course was the very first day.
    

            “I did not sleep at all the night before, I was so scared, way in over my head,” she told CNN.
    

            Murphy, who currently works as a pediatric intensive care unit nurse at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, graduated from Ranger School on July 19, becoming the first female Army nurse to ever complete the course.
    

            Over roughly 60 days of the school the Army hails as its “toughest course,” students “train to exhaustion,” completing arduous physical and mental exercises across three intense phases, taking them from the mountainous terrain of Georgia to the swampy conditions in Florida.
    

            As of Wednesday, 143 women have graduated from the US Army Ranger Course, also called Ranger School, since the first women graduated in 2015, the Army told CNN. Murphy’s accomplishment is all the more notable given her nursing background, which stood in stark contrast to the majority of her Ranger School counterparts who served in combat.
    

            “I was like, ‘I did these tactics eight years ago at ROTC, and I thought I would never hear the word “ambush” ever again, I am so lost,’” Murphy recalled, laughing. “But I’m a very good note taker, super type-A, you know, like any critical care nurse is. And so I was just writing everything anyone said down, and I had this, like, crazy notebook that the boys would flip through whenever they were freaking out.”
    

            The first women to graduate Ranger School were Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver, just two years after many combat roles in the military were opened up to women. Just months after their graduation, in December 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced he was clearing the way for women to serve in the roughly 220,000 remaining military jobs that were limited to men, including some in special operations.
    

            Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, commander of US Army Special Operations Command, said last year that having women in special operations is “not a nice to have, it’s a must.”
    

            “If you just take the protection of United States and the most critical threats we have out there, we need everybody when you talk about defense of our nation, not just in the Army but at a macro scale. … It’s critical to our mission,” he said.
    

            Murphy told CNN it was clear what kind of advantages women can bring to the table. For example, she excelled at the combat techniques training involving operational orders — what unit commanders send down to subordinate units outlining the mission they’re undertaking — so she would take on the brunt of that task while her teammates got a little more sleep.
    

            Men and women working together “complement each other,” she said, “and that’s what makes us such a good team.”
    

            Murphy’s journey to Ranger School began when she was a child, she said. Her mother died in an accident when she was young, leaving her and her two brothers to be raised by their father, who served in the National Guard. Her whole life, she said, she was “keeping up with the boys,” constantly competing and carving out a place for herself.
    

            That also led her to go into the ROTC program at the University of Nebraska, after her father encouraged her to serve as an officer to help pay for school.
    

            From there, she continued to excel. While working as a nurse at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, she attended the Army’s Air Assault and Jungle Schools, and at the end of the latter she was encouraged to go to Ranger School for the first time by a teammate.
    

            “I was like ‘No, that’s crazy!’ A girl like me, I’m a nurse, Jungle School is the furthest I’ll ever go,” Murphy recalled saying.
    

            She was again told to consider it while competing in the Army’s Best Medic Competition last year, which tests competitors not just on their medical prowess but physical fitness and endurance, land navigation and more. As one of two women there, she said, more senior officers were regularly talking to her about her career. While she didn’t win the competition, she recalled that multiple colonels told her after watching her compete that she “needed to go to Ranger School,” she said, even going so far as to tell her leadership back in Hawaii to send her.
    

            Her biggest hesitation, she joked to CNN, was knowing she’d have to shave her head. But just months later, her former Jungle School teammate began helping her train.
    

            The first phase of Ranger School, called the Darby Phase, focuses on physical and mental stamina. It takes soldiers on ground patrols, foot marches, physical assessments and requires them to receive positive peer evaluations. It’s the phase where roughly half of students will drop out, according to the Army.
    

            It’s not uncommon for students to recycle, or repeat, phases in Ranger School. And at first, Murphy was one of them — she had to repeat Darby Phase. Not having experience in combat arms like her teammates originally had her at a disadvantage, but she poured herself into studying and training for the 10 days in between retrying the Darby Phase, which she successfully completed.
    

            Just hours after completing the first phase, soldiers move to the second — Mountain Phase — where they train on leading platoons on combat patrol operations across rugged terrain where the “stamina and commitment of the Ranger student is stressed to the maximum,” according to the Army.
    

            Finally, in the Florida Phase, students continue training on leading small units during things like airborne and dismounted patrol operations, conducting 10 days of patrols during “a fast paced, highly stressful, challenging field exercise.”
    

            While Murphy said she was surprised by how little medical training played a role in the course, being a nurse prepared her in different ways. Being on her feet for 12 hours a day, often skipping meals and having to be “100% sharp at all times, because someone’s life is in your hands … definitely gave me a one-up,” she said.
    

            Because of a worsening infection in her foot, Murphy was forced to leave the competition on the last two days for surgery at a hospital in Florida. She traveled back to Georgia for graduation afterward but was hospitalized again for pain the day before. She begged her doctors to let her attend graduation and they eventually agreed — sending her on crutches, with nerve blocks to try to limit the pain.
    

            “I was just so excited about how many of us from my platoon made it. … It’s just so exciting to be able to celebrate with them, that we were all able to pull each other there,” she said, emphasizing repeatedly that being able to lean on one another throughout the course made all the difference.
    

            Now, going back to nursing, her biggest takeaway has been the leadership skills she learned, particularly how to keep pushing in the midst of chaos.
    

            “It is so hard to lead in an environment where everyone is starving, and everyone is tired,” she said, “and my goal was to see if I could stay positive in those moments where you are at your lowest. … And I want to help people understand that your most difficult times are where you grow the most.”

            Two Al Jazeera correspondents were killed in a reported Israeli airstrike in Al-Shati refugee camp, northern Gaza, on Wednesday, according to the news network, sparking condemnation from advocacy groups and highlighting the dangers for local reporters covering the war.
    

            Ismail Al-Ghoul and his cameraman, Rami Al-Rifi, who lived in the besieged enclave, were killed in an airstrike on their car in the al Shati refugee camp, according to the Qatar-based network. The journalists, both aged 27, were reporting live for much of the day from a location close to the family home of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital of Tehran on Tuesday.
    

            Al-Ghoul was wearing a press flak vest when he was killed, according to his colleague. He had not seen his wife and two-year-old daughter Zeina, who were displaced in central Gaza, in 10 months. “These days are not like any other,” he said in a post on X in June. “Zeina began running, talking, asking questions… She was growing up without me seeing her.”

            Al Jazeera condemned what it claimed was the “targeted assassination” of its journalists by Israeli forces, claiming the attack was “part of a systematic targeting campaign against the network’s journalists and their families since October 2023.”
    

            CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
    

            The network’s managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, said in a post on X that Al-Ghoul was “renowned for his professionalism and dedication, bringing the world’s attention to the suffering and atrocities committed in Gaza… Without Ismail, the world would not have seen the devastating images of these massacres.”
    

            More than nine months of Israel’s bombing campaign has shredded the besieged enclave, erased entire neighborhoods and deepened a humanitarian crisis. Palestinian reporters have become the eyes and ears of those suffering under the shadow of war. Both Israel and Egypt, which control Gaza’s borders, have so far refused to give international journalists unfettered access to the strip, saying that they cannot guarantee their safety.
    

            It is the photos, footage and reporting from local reporters, often gathered at great personal risk, that have shown the world what is happening. The Israeli offensive in Gaza has marked the deadliest period for journalists since 1992. As of July 31, at least 111 journalists and media workers have been killed since October — 109 of whom were Palestinian — according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
    

            A reporter in Gaza who had spent much of the day with the Al Jazeera crew told CNN on Wednesday that he was 300 meters away from the missile that hit their vehicle. Video from the scene shows the burnt-out shell of a small saloon car that appears to have been targeted from above.
    

            “I was going home close to where we were filming when one, exactly one missile from a drone targeted Ismail and Rami,” said Ayman Abed, a resident of Al-Shati camp. “There was nothing unusual except the sound of drones in the sky humming. It was one strike on their car.”
    

            Israel launched its military offensive after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted.
    

            Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and injured another 90,000, according to the Ministry of Health there.
    

            Palestinian journalists and press freedom groups paid tribute to Al-Ghoul and Al-Rifi in the wake of the attack, demanding greater accountability for those responsible for attacks on reporters in Gaza.
    

            The CPJ asked Israel to explain the killing of both Al Jazeera staffers, in what it said, “appears to be a direct strike.” Jodie Ginsberg, the CPJ chief, added: “Journalists are civilians and should never be targeted.”
    

            The world’s largest union for journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, also criticized the strike, in a post on X: “We are running out of words to condemn this massacre. Israel must stop killing journalists.”
    

            Khader Al-Za’anoun of Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, recalled his friendship with the Al Jazeera journalist. “It’s a difficult and painful feeling to cover this horrific story; he’s my friend and colleague, and we’re together in the field most of the time during this war,” he said.
    

            CNN video filmed in the aftermath of the attack on Wednesday showed dozens of Palestinians gathered outside the nearby Al-Ahli Baptist the Hospital in Gaza City, as they mourned the loss of Al-Ghoul and his colleague. Al Jazeera reporters Yousef Al Saudi and Anas Al Sharif could be seen breaking down as they held Al-Ghoul’s bloodied flak jacket.
    

            “Our colleague Ismail was wearing this blood-stained vest,” fellow Al Jazeera journalist Yousef Al Saudi said, as he removed the “PRESS” sign from the jacket. “The sign was covered by blood to silence the world and the images in Gaza. The pictures continue and the coverage continues, God willing.”
    

            Choking back tears, Al Sharif said: “Dear Ismail, we will complete the mission after you.”
    

            Another video shows journalist Wadi Shehandeh addressing a crowd, saying: “By targeting us as media professionals, they want this coverage to stop, and to silence us. But no, by God, if only one of the media professionals remained in northern Gaza, they will continue to share the images.”
    

            He said journalists in Gaza would not cease their coverage, adding, “Ismail is not dead. Ismail lives in our hearts. His message will continue.”

CNN_90,Four takeaways from a thrilling night of Olympic swimming,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/takeaways-amazing-olympic-swimming-day5-spt/index.html,2024-08-01 05:31:00,world,"
            One of the most exciting swimming nights of these Olympics is in the books after Wednesday night’s record-setting races.
    

            The evening saw a new world record, multiple new Olympic records set, an American legend put her stamp on these Games, a French hero turned into a legend and exciting editions of swimming’s most electric race.
    

            Here are four takeaways from a big night in the pool:
    

            American legend Katie Ledecky once again created another iconic Olympic image of her just absolutely destroying her competition.

Katie Ledecky: The rise of an Olympic great


            It’s a sight that has now become familiar but is nevertheless awe-inspiring. The sight of Ledecky pulling away from her competition over the 15-minute race, gradually and then seemingly all at once, can’t help making one shake their head and chuckle. She is simply on a different planet than the rest of the competitors in this race.
    

            Ledecky broke her own Olympic record set three years ago in Tokyo by more than five seconds and finished 10 seconds ahead of France’s Anastasiia Kirpichnikova, whose finish had the home nation fans in full voice.
    

            After a disappointing start to the Games with a bronze medal in the 400-meter freestyle, Ledecky was clearly thrilled with her performance. She splashed the water in joy upon finishing, raised her fist in the air while still in the pool and put both arms above her head in exultation when she exited.
    

            The American swimming superstar now owns the 20 fastest times in history in the 1500m freestyle – an astounding feat which demonstrates her utter dominance of the distance.
    

            “I did have fun, I felt really good, I just tried to hold steady the whole time… just swim a time I could feel happy with. I’m really proud of that swim,” Ledecky said afterwards. “I’m excited for the rest of the week, I have the relay tomorrow and that’s next on the docket.”
    

            Ledecky competes next in the 4x200 freestyle relay on Thursday.
    

            Léon Marchand entered these Olympics with high expectations and the hopes of a nation on his shoulders whenever he got in the water.
    

            Suffice to say, he’s carrying that weight pretty well.
    

            In his first race of the night, the 200-meter butterfly, Marchand trailed for about three-quarters of the race. But, urged on by tens of thousands of boisterous French compatriots, he exploded out of the final turn and entered the last 50 meters of the race in first, bringing whatever portions of the crowd that weren’t already standing to their feet.
    

            Kristóf Milák had led the entire way to that point, but Marchand rode a wave of French cheers to take the lead and set a new Olympic record in the race.
    

            During the medal ceremony, the noise for Marchand was close to overwhelming and the sound of the French crowd singing “La Marseillaise” induced goosebumps.
    

            But he wasn’t done yet.
    

            He never looked bothered in the 200-meter breaststroke, setting yet another Olympic record as he cruised to victory. The atmosphere in La Défense Arena was again electric as shouts of “Allez!” came up from the crowd every time Marchand surfaced during the breaststroke.
    

            He also completed a feat that hadn’t been done in decades: winning two individual gold medals in one night. That feat had not been accomplished since the 1976 Games in Montreal.
    

            The final singing of “La Marseillaise” of the night came with massive smiles and chants of the new French legend’s name rang around the arena during his victory lap.
    

            The pool at La Défense Arena has been described as slow by some of the swimmers in Paris. It’s shallower than most Olympic pools, causing a bit more drag on the swimmers as they go through the water.
    

            Multiple Olympic records had been broken at these Games, but the world records had remained intact.
    

            Until China’s swimming superman Pan Zhanle took to the water.
    

            Pan had already set the world record earlier this year in Doha, Qatar. But his swim on Wednesday night in Paris shattered that mark, taking almost a half-second off that time.
    

            In the end, it was Pan’s race against himself that was most exciting. The distance between him and his nearest competitor was more than a second – an incredible distance in such a short race.
    

            The first race of the night was one of the quickest races on the Olympic docket and it packed a lot of drama into less than a minute.
    

            American Torri Huske made the turn at the halfway point in the lead. Swimming in Lane 1, Huske looked set to pull off an unlikely gold medal win and was heading toward the wall with aplomb.
    

            But in the last 25 meters of the race, Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström made her charge.
    

            As the crowd roared – plenty of American fans were in La Défense Arena, even if it was mainly French – Sjöström simply could not be denied as the 30-year-old turned back the clock in spectacular fashion.
    

            Sjöström hit the wall .13 seconds ahead of Huske to take home the gold, with the American having to settle for silver. She beat out bronze medalist Hong Kong’s Siobhan Bernadette Haughey by .04 seconds.
    

            “I have no more words,” Sjöström said post-race. “This is unbelievable. My reaction said everything. I didn’t know where I was when I finished. It took a few seconds before I saw that I won.
    

            “I didn’t think I would swim the 100 free. After the freestyle relay the first day, I told my coach straight away, ‘I don’t think the 100 free is for me. No, I want to do the 50. I will rest until the 50.’ He was like, ‘No way. You need to go out there and see what you can do, no matter the outcome.’ The staff made my mind.
    

            “I didn’t know exactly what I could do, and I definitely didn’t know what everyone else could do. I am proud of myself that I tried this,” she added.

CNN_91,Fact check: Trump’s lie that Harris ‘all of a sudden’ embraced a Black identity,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/fact-check-debunking-trumps-lie-that-harris-suddenly-embraced-a-black-identity/index.html,2024-08-01 06:25:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity.
    

            Harris’ father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?”
    

            As one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black college, Trump continued, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went – she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that, too.”
    

            Trump’s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true.
    

Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not “all of a sudden” begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage.


            Harris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, she wrote in her 2019 memoir.
    

            Politico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism. Politico reported: “For Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of ‘what we deal with all the time.’”
    

            A profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as “a Black man” and saying, “I grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.”
    

            Harris’ official online biography in 2005 as San Francisco district attorney referred to her as “the first African American woman in California to hold the office” and noted that she had attended “America’s oldest black university.” She wrote in a 2009 book about her childhood trips to both India and Jamaica, where, she wrote, “my father and uncles would talk to us about the complicated struggles of the people of Jamaica - the history of slavery, colonialism, and immigration.”
    

            Her official online biography as California attorney general referred to her as “the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office” of San Francisco district attorney. In 2017, her first year as a US senator for California, she spoke about how she was “the second Black woman elected to the United States Senate.”
    

            Harris wrote in the 2019 memoir about how her mother’s family instilled her and her sister Maya with “pride in our South Asian roots,” but also that “my mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”
    

            Harris said in another 2017 speech: “Look at my own life, where a daughter of a South Asian mother and a Jamaican father concluded her own interfaith wedding with her husband breaking a glass and everyone yelling, ‘Mazel tov.’”
    

            Trump made numerous other false claims in his remarks at the Wednesday gathering.Among other claims we have fact-checked before, Trump:
    

            - Wrongly referred to Harris as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” Her actual immigration-related assignment from Biden, to lead a diplomatic effort to tackle “root causes” of migration in three Central American countries, was much more limited.
    

            - Falsely claimed that the US has its worst inflation in “over 100 years.” Even at its 9.1% peak during the Biden presidency, inflation was at about a 41-year high, and it has since plummeted to 3%.
    

            - Falsely claimed he was “protected” under the Presidential Records Act for taking official documents after his presidency. That law actually requires presidents to return all documents to the federal government when they leave office.
    

            - Falsely claimed that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the issue of abortion policy returned to individual states. In fact, polls have consistently shown about two-thirds of the public as a whole and an even higher percentage of Democrats had wanted Roe to be preserved.
    

            - Repeated his never-substantiated claim about foreign countries opening up their prisons to allow criminals to migrate to the US.
    

            - Falsely claimed that Haris “didn’t pass” the bar exam. Harris failed on her first attempt, which is common in California, but then passed; she was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. (Trump, appearing to respond to an objection from someone in the crowd, conceded a bit later that Harris “maybe” had passed.)
    

            - Falsely claimed that “nobody died” on January 6, 2021. Four Trump supporters at the Capitol died that day, three from medical emergencies and one after she was shot by police while trying to break into a sensitive part of the building. (Trump mentioned the shooting right before he claimed nobody died.) In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”

CNN_92,Maduro warns he’ll call for a ‘new revolution’ if forced by ‘North American imperialism’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/americas/maduro-revolution-venezuela-intl-latam/index.html,2024-08-01 06:49:00,world,"
            Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro warned Wednesday that he will not hesitate to call on the population for a “new revolution” if forced by what he calls “North American imperialism and fascist criminals.”
    

            Maduro’s comments come amid deadly protests across the country following its disputed presidential election victory, which the US and several other countries have refused to recognize.
    

            “I would not like to go to other ways of making revolution, I say it solemnly from political power, we want to continue the path that [Hugo] Chavez outlined,” Maduro said in Caracas during a press conference with international media.
    

            “But if North American imperialism and fascist criminals force us, my pulse will not tremble to call the people to a new revolution with other characteristics,” he added.
    

            The president’s comments come just hours after US National Security spokesman John Kirby called on Maduro to “come clean” on Sunday’s election.

Venezuela is wracked with protests and election uncertainty. Here’s what to know


            “Our patience, and that of the international community, is running out on waiting for the Venezuelan electoral authorities to come clean and release the full, detailed data on this election so everyone can see the results,” Kirby told reporters during Wednesday’s White House press briefing.
    

            Kirby said the US and other nations share “serious concerns of the reports of casualties, violence and arrests, including the arrests warrants that Maduro and his representatives issued today (Wednesday) for opposition leaders.”
    

            “Alongside the international community, we are watching, and we are going to respond accordingly,” Kirby said.
    

            The Venezuelan leader’s comments came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it had received 20 “credible reports” of deaths connected to the nationwide protests over the election results.
    

            “We are working to document and corroborate each case,” Juanita Goebertus, HRW Director for the Americas, wrote on X.
    

            Foro Penal, a local NGO, reported on Tuesday that a total of 11 people have died during the protests.
    

            Of those killed, five died in Caracas, two in Zulia and Yaracuy, and one in Aragua and Tachira, the head of Foro Penal, Alfredo Romero, told reporters on Tuesday.
    

            CNN has reached out to Venezuela’s Public Prosecutor for comment.
    

            So far, the Venezuelan government has not published any information regarding the death of civilians.

CNN_93,Olympic moment of the day: Léon Marchand turns himself into a French legend,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/sport/leon-marchand-olympic-moment-of-the-day-spt/index.html,2024-08-01 06:17:00,world,"
            There are moments in sports when you can feel an athlete becoming a legend before your very eyes. Wednesday was one of those nights.
    

            La Défense Arena just outside of Paris was full of French tricolore flags and anticipation as home nation fans waited for Léon. And Frenchman Léon Marchand might have earned that one-name status in France after doing something that hadn’t been done in almost 50 years – winning two individual swimming gold medals in the same night, setting two Olympic records in the process.
    

            The noise inside the arena was just incredible. Once Marchand’s first race was announced on the big screen, the chants began: “Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on!” When he appered on the pool deck, a roar went up and then more chants: “Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on!” The buzzer went off and an almighty cheer went up from the crowd. The chant of Marchand’s first name began again.
    

            Marchand began his first race, the 200-meter butterfly, trailing. Hungarian Kristóf Milák looked ready to play spoiler on the Frenchman’s big night, setting the pace and looking strong for the first three-quarters of the contest.
    

            And then Marchand kicked off the pool wall into the final 50 meters of the race and the arena suddenly sounded like the inside of a jet engine.
    

            The Frenchman surged past Milák while still underwater and when he surfaced, the crowd noticed his lead. The roar in the arena – already noted by many swimmers as incredibly loud and one of the most raucous of these Paris Games – turned deafening as Marchand carried the edge into the final meters.
    

            When he hit the wall first, that unbelievable level of noise somehow went up another level. It’s a miracle the roof is still on this beautiful arena in Nanterre.
    

            “I could hear the whole pool going crazy. I think that’s why I was able to win that race. I really used that energy from the crowd,” Marchand said after.
    

            A few semifinal heats allowed the crowd to catch its breath somewhat before their hero again walked out for a rousing edition of “La Marseillaise.” The song, a rollicking cry of resistance to France’s enemies in the late 1700s as the royals of Europe attempted to crush the French Revolution, was sung from the belly by every French fan in the crowd.
    

            And as he took a victory lap, the chant began again: “Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on!”
    

            After all that, Marchand somehow still had to swim again.
    

            One might think that after all those emotions, after all those “Lé-on!”s, Marchand might be experiencing an adrenaline dump that would be hard to surpass. And maybe he did – he benefitted from another long break for more preliminary heats and medal ceremonies.
    

            But once the pool deck cleared after the final preliminary heat in the women’s 200-meter breaststroke, the chant went up again before any swimmers had entered: “Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on! Lé-on!”
    

            Marchand took a few very deep breaths as he was introduced, waving to his crowd. Another roar greeted the buzzer to start the race.
    

            This time, Marchand did not need to make a comeback.
    

            Shouts of “Allez!” went up every time the Frenchman surfaced; a raucous repetition that grew louder as Marchand seemed to grow ever stronger. There was no doubt in this one.
    

            “Every time I took a breath, I could hear the huge noise for me. It’s pretty cool,” he said.
    

            When Marchand touched the wall first, setting yet another Olympic record and finishing almost a second before silver medalist Zac Stubblety-Cook (whose Olympic record from Tokyo was broken), the jet engine revved up again.
    

            The French crowd roared. Even if they didn’t know what they had just witnessed was a piece of Games history, they knew they had just seen an Olympic star become a French legend.
    

            “I think it will take a while for me to realize,” Marchand told reporters after the race when he was asked about the experience. “It will take a while for me to realize the first day too. So, I’m just going to keep going.
    

            “I have the [200 individual medley] tomorrow, so I’ll just focus on that for now. I really enjoyed every moment of those two finals. It was really amazing for me to swim in those, it was really good opponents too. That [200-meter butterfly race] was crazy for me.”
    

            His coach Bob Bowman, the same man who coached Michael Phelps to legendary status, said the scenes in Nanterre were simply amazing.
    

            “It’s a night he’ll never forget,” Bowman said. “Hope he just remembers everything about it.”
    

            But Bowman also knows the downside of this moment. He told reporters he thinks Marchand can still improve – and has to survive success.
    

            “The key thing for him, which sadly I know about – he doesn’t know about it yet – is he’s got to survive the success, right?” Bowman said. “He’s got to come out of what’s next. And he has no idea, but I know exactly what’s next. And then somehow, he has to find his way back to a pool in Austin, Texas, and start going up and down it.”
    

            Surely, Marchand will find a way to survive his Paris performances. That’s the thing about legends: they always find a way to make even more history and become even greater.

CNN_94,"Tesla car that killed Seattle motorcyclist was in ‘Full Self-Driving’ mode, police say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/tech/tesla-full-self-driving-mode-seattle-motorcyclist-killed/index.html,2024-08-01 07:51:00,us,"
            A Tesla Model S car was in “Full Self-Driving” mode when it hit and killed a 28-year-old motorcyclist in the Seattle area in April, police said, making it at least the second fatal accident involving the technology on which Tesla CEO Elon Musk is pinning his hopes.
    

            The 56-year-old driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular homicide based on his admission that he was looking at his cell phone while using the driver assistant feature, police said in a statement.
    

            Tesla says its “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software requires active driver supervision and does not make vehicles autonomous.
    

            Previously, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said there was one fatal accident involving a Tesla vehicle using FSD software between August 2022 and August 2023.
    

            The NHTSA said that it “is aware of this crash and is gathering information from local law enforcement and Tesla.”
    

            The police said the case remains under investigation, but experts say there are limitations to Tesla’s technology dependent on cameras and artificial intelligence. Tesla’s rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo also uses expensive sensors like lidars to detect the driving environment.

            “There are so many things that can go wrong” with Tesla’s camera-only system, said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. For instance, he said it can inaccurately measure how far away an object is.
    

            “It is extremely challenging to collect and curate data from all sorts of real-world elements such as motorcycles and bicycles in the broad range of possible weather, lightning, road and traffic conditions,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
    

            This year, Musk shelved Tesla’s all-new affordable cars and increased his bets on self-driving vehicles, saying he will be shocked if Tesla cannot achieve full self-driving capability next year.
    

            Speaking in an interview with the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley club last weekend, he said a future vehicle will be like a “tiny mobile lounge” where drivers will be able to watch movies, play video games, work and even drink and sleep.
    

            Musk has been aiming to achieve self-driving capability for several years, with the technology under growing regulatory and legal scrutiny.
    

            The NHTSA began a probe of Autopilot in August 2021 after identifying more than a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles had hit stationary emergency vehicles, and reviewed hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot.
    

            In December 2023, Tesla was forced to recall nearly all its vehicles on U.S. roads to add safeguards to the software.

CNN_95,‘This story is no longer available’: Instagram permanently deletes some photos,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/tech/instagram-story-archives-deletion/index.html,2024-08-01 07:16:00,us,"
            Some Instagram posters got a shocking notification from the app Wednesday: Certain photos have been permanently deleted from the app’s Stories archives, unable to be recovered.
    

            “This story is no longer available,” some users saw on certain Stories. “Due to a technical issue, this story is no longer available. While we’ve since fixed this issue, your story can’t be restored.”
    

            Meta, which owns Instagram, declined to share how many users were affected, but said only the people whose Stories were lost will see the notice.
    

            “We found and fixed a bug that caused some people’s Story highlights and archives to be deleted. Unfortunately, we are unable to restore these Stories and we’re letting people know in the app if they’re impacted,” a Meta spokesperson said Wednesday.
    

            Meta said the black screen showing the error message would be gone by July 2025.
    

            Instagram Stories are a more casual, less committing form of posting. Users can upload photos, videos or text posts that disappear in 24 hours. More exclusive content can go on a curated Close Friends list or can permanently be placed on your profile as a story highlight.
    

            Stories differ from normal pictures, as they’re often personalized with music, gifs, text, filters and interactive features like polls. Many users treat their Story Archives as a photo diary — ranging from memes, screenshots of Spotify songs to show off music taste, to chill poolside photos from a beach vacation. Instagram even shows “memories” in the archives tab, pulling up an old story from what the user did on that day from past years. Some people also use Story Archives as a way to store pictures and videos.
    

            Instagram doesn’t automatically save stories to your camera roll unless users turn on a setting — instead, they are auto uploaded to the Story Archives, which is what the bug affected along with the Story Highlights.
    

            The bug serves as another reminder that relying on a single backup method for media can be a bad idea. For important memories, people should ensure they back up photos, videos and other media outside of an app, no matter how trustworthy the company may be.

WaPo_2,"As Israel strikes Lebanon, a new war flares within",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/israel-hezbollah-strike-military-base-attack/,2024-07-31 12:00:02.778514,,"You’re reading an excerpt from the WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Israel’s much-anticipated retaliatory strike landed Tuesday evening. At least one person was killed and dozens reportedly injured in an airstrike that slammed into a densely populated neighborhood in the southern environs of Beirut, the Lebanese capital. Israeli authorities said they targeted and killed a top commander in Hezbollah, the influential Lebanese Shiite organization, who they linked to a rocket attack that had killed 12 children in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights over the weekend. At the time of writing, however, it was not clear whether the Hezbollah official, Fouad Shukr, was among the casualties.The Israeli reprisal was expected, but it stoked fresh fears of regional escalation as the Jewish state fights battles on two fronts — against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza to the south and Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian proxy, in Lebanon to the north. The former conflict has been unprecedented in its scale and devastation, with Israel’s military flattening much of the Gaza Strip and killing tens of thousands civilians, according to Gazan health officials. The latter has yet to flare into a full-scale war, in part thanks to the wariness of the adversaries in both Lebanon and Israel, as well as the desperate diplomacy of the United States and its regional partners.“Lebanon has been bracing for war since Saturday, when a projectile hit a soccer field full of children in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights. Israel immediately blamed Hezbollah, and vowed that it would pay a ‘heavy price,’” my colleagues reported. “Hezbollah denied it was behind the strike. On Tuesday, as the two traded fire, Israel said that a civilian was killed after suffering shrapnel wounds in one of Hezbollah’s rocket attacks.”The Biden administration voiced support for Israel but expressed hope that tensions wouldn’t spiral further. “We do not believe that an all-out war is inevitable,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a news briefing. “We believe it can be avoided” through diplomacy. In an interview with Reuters, Lebanese foreign minister Abdallah Bou Habib condemned the Israeli strike on Beirut and cautioned Hezbollah, which has a deep footprint in Lebanese politics and society, about its next steps.“Hopefully any response will be proportionate and will not be more than that, so that this wave of killing, hitting and shelling will stop,” he said.As it braces for a new escalation, Israel also finds itself careening toward a clash closer to home. On Monday, far-right protesters and at least one Israel lawmakers participated in the storming of Sde Teiman military base in the Negev desert. The cause of their ire was the Israeli military’s detention of nine reservists suspected of participating in the abuse of a Palestinian prisoner. Far-right demonstrators also broke into Beit Lid military base in central Israel, where some of these reservists were allegedly being held. Security forces cleared them out Monday evening but the disturbances spoke volumes of rifts growing within Israeli society and politics.In the shadow of Israel’s war in Gaza, the country’s armed forces have picked up thousands of Palestinians from the territory. “Military detention camps such as Sde Teiman have served as an initial holding point for Palestinians detained in Gaza,” my colleagues reported. “After weeks, sometimes months, in detention, those who are later alleged to have militant links are typically transferred into the Israeli prison system; others are released without charge, often after weeks of abuse and interrogation, according to the testimony of former detainees.”The stories that have emerged from inside these facilities have shocked rights groups. Reports detail frequent physical abuse, sensory depravation and even sexual assault. “The situation there is more horrific than anything we’ve heard about Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo,” Khaled Mahajneh, the first lawyer to visit detainees at Sde Teiman, told +972 magazine, an Israeli publication, last month.“After months of mounting international scrutiny and domestic legal challenges, in early June Israeli authorities announced they had begun transferring hundreds of Gazan detainees to other military-run facilities,” my colleagues reported. “The development came in response to a petition before Israel’s Supreme Court challenging the detention center’s legality and calling for its closure because of abuse and torture allegations.”But many Israelis are opposed to such scrutiny, including top ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing cabinet. “I’m calling on the chief military prosecutor, get your hands off the reservists,” Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, wrote on social media. “Take your hands off the reservists,” posted Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister, who oversees the prison system.Footage from a Monday meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, saw some lawmakers bickering over the decision to censure soldiers alleged to have sodomized a Palestinian detainee, with one official suggesting that all punitive action is “legitimate” against Palestinian prisoners. “In essence, soldiers are in open rebellion for the right to rape prisoners, and more and more coalition politicians are joining them,” posted leftist Israeli journalist Haggai Matar.The far-right agitations on Monday weren’t a unique occurrence, nor can their rage be solely pinned on the traumas Hamas unleashed through its hideous Oct. 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel. Far-right groups have assaulted convoys carrying aid to Gaza, while vigilantes from settlements in the West Bank — a hotbed of the Israeli far right — have long participated in attacks on Palestinian civilians in their midst. Figures like Ben Gvir and Smotrich, brought into power by Netanyahu, have encouraged such radical action. “In the past it could still be said that they were a handful or a minority, but today they are the government, they are the law, they are the face of Israel,” Israeli journalist Oren Ziv wrote.Netanyahu condemned the scenes Monday — but his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was sterner. “The backing and active participation of elected officials in riots at IDF bases, along with harsh statements against senior IDF officers, is a very serious and dangerous phenomenon that harms security, social cohesion, and Israel’s image in the eyes of the world,” Gallant said Tuesday. “This dangerous phenomenon must be dealt with decisively and immediately.”The developments were the “closest I’ve ever experienced to state breakdown,” political analyst Dahlia Scheindlin noted, adding that the discord amounted to an indirect victory for outfits like Hamas and Hezbollah. “This is better than they ever dreamed.”"

Our first pregnancy ended in early miscarriage. Our previous pregnancy was punctuated by preeclampsia at 34 weeks, an emergency C-section and a 2½- week NICU stay.I obviously understand his fears, but I also feel as if moving forward with the knowledge of how our previous pregnancy went can help us be more prepared the second time.We also don’t have much family nearby and have not had a lot of outside support or help with our first child. We have gone over and over on this, and I am really struggling on how to compromise.— Oh BabyOh Baby: You’re struggling because you can’t. There’s no halfway on kids. You try to expand your family, or you agree not to.Plus, if it were enough to “understand his fears,” then you wouldn’t have reached this impasse. You need concrete ways to address his fears to his satisfaction.You don’t say whether “over and over” has included concrete proposals. If it has, then you’re done here. His answer to more kids is no, and your only path is acceptance.But if your back-and-forth has stalled at his saying, “I’m not doing that again,” and your saying, “But we’ll know better next time,” then here are some options. Not so you can get what you want, mind you, but for him, because he’s the one who just faced a worst case of losing both spouse and child with zero local support and who apparently hasn’t recovered from that:1. Move closer to meaningful family — however you and he define that. His, yours, of origin, of choice.2. Line up reliable, layered outside support. Do this now anyway for the family you’ve got. Things may seem fine without it, but you’re just between urgencies. Now’s the time to staff up, emotionally or otherwise.3. Postpone deciding on more kids for another year or three. That would give him extra emotional recovery time, along with a child who is that much older if you wind up on bed rest or worse. You could have an uneventful pregnancy and birth, sure. Or not — and as traumatic as the last experience was, handing him even an exact repeat of that in nine to 18 months would include his having to wrangle a toddler through it alone, which would be profoundly more stressful for him.4. Add children to your family by means other than your bearing them.I probably sound like Team One-and-Done, but I’m not. I’m Team This Doesn’t Affect Me One Iota. So I can throw stuff out there that maybe you and he won’t risk in what feels like a meaning-of-life negotiation.Really, it comes down to this: Your husband wanted “kids,” plural, before he got a front-row look at the possible costs. Now he’s at “kid,” singular. You either both find a way to reduce those possible costs, or you join him in reframing what you have as right for your family. (Or, of course, you blow up the family you have in service of building the family you want with someone else, which I hope is grayed out on your drop-down menu.)That means any “compromise” here is within yourself, if it comes to that. Sometimes even plans that seem routine — location, spouse, kids — become contradictory and have to be reconciled into a new vision of who we will be."

I ride in the front as the “pilot,” and my wife is the “stoker” behind me.As you may know, there is inevitably someone who finds it humorous to call out “She’s not pedaling!” as we pass by, quite often as we are taking on challenging terrain. Having encountered this phenomenon too many times to count, neither of us finds it within ourselves to share in the amusement. On the contrary, as my wife takes her role in our team effort seriously and is quite fit, we both struggle to avoid succumbing to irritation.Each of us, in turn, has attempted responses in friendly jest, with some success. But other times, we find ourselves caught dumbstruck. I wonder if Miss Manners might suggest a polite way to maintain a friendly, casual exchange while being clear that we respect each person’s effort and dedication to an activity that we truly enjoy?Smile and wave, as if responding to an entirely different comment such as, “Well done!” The caller will be perplexed or frustrated and assume you misheard, but by then, Miss Manners trusts, you will have passed them.Dear Miss Manners: I would like to know the most polite way to request water with no ice at a restaurant.The most common experience for me is that the waitstaff will come to the table, pitcher in hand, and immediately pour water (with ice) for everyone. I know he or she is trying to be accommodating, but most often, I prefer no ice. Sometimes I would like sparkling water, if they have it.When there is a glass of ice water already poured for me, should I just accept it, or should I say something? I have spoken up in the past, but I feel like a difficult patron.One of the few upsides of the apparently increasing rudeness of contemporary society is that Miss Manners can assure you that if you politely ask for plain water in a restaurant, you will not be the most difficult patron there.Dear Miss Manners: I have a wedding to plan, but I don’t know anyone’s address! Most of my friends move every couple of years.I figure that simply asking for their address via text is fine (right?), but it also got me thinking: How does one send a condolence card to a person whose address you don’t know? Texting the bereaved seems callous, and responding is probably not on their list of priorities.1. Text: “Could you please send me your address? I’d like to send a condolence letter.” 2.

This employer handled the situation like all enablers of abusers: deny, blame, ignore, and marginalize the victim. I was 59 when this happened and had never faced anything like it.I found a new job and worked at this company for five years. My boss wrote the last of my always-positive reviews. At the conclusion of this evaluation, he stated that I’m “not just a great employee, but also a great person” who is always reliable, treats everyone with respect, sets an example of excellence, and who made his job as my supervisor a joy.I'd like to send a copy of this review to my previous employer where I was bullied to let them know that I was not the problem, they were.Part of me feels that this would be petty and vindictive. At the same time, I’ve never had any real sense of closure from this experience. I’d like to let them know that this disposable human being survived.— Getting the Last WordLast Word: Sometimes a little petty can be a lot of fun, but bullies and abusers have a way of wheedling their way back into our consciousness, and that can turn a petty party into torture.You want your previous employer to acknowledge the terrible way he treated you and the value that you have as a person and as an employee. He's not going to do that, and it will taint the joy that your evaluation gives you.You escaped this toxic work environment. Don't buy a return ticket, even for a victory lap. Frame your evaluation as a reminder that you had the ability and the strength to write a new chapter.Dear Eric: I have been married to my husband for 27 years. Now that we are seniors, he has the means and time to take up a lifelong dream of flying a small sport plane. He is taking lessons weekly and loves it.Great, you say? Not if you are me. I lost my first husband to a small plane crash that killed him and two of my best friends. I was left to raise my two young girls by myself. It was hard and tragic.My current husband came along when the two girls were nearly grown.Knowing my history, I can't understand why my current husband would take up flying lessons. It is very distressing for me.My logical side says that lightning won’t strike twice, but my fear is my fear. I find it most distressing that he won’t consider my feelings. Am I being unreasonable?— Earthbound WifeWife: You aren’t being unreasonable. This is a major source of trauma for you. Even though it was decades ago, you’re still processing parts of it. This sort of grief is a lifelong relationship, unfortunately. It is, indeed, a relationship that predates your current 27-year marriage. Your husband doesn’t realize that he’s not up against airplane safety facts and stats. He’s up against decades-old grief.Ask him to go with you to a few sessions of marriage counseling to have a mediated conversation about the way this hobby is affecting both of you. The goal is not to get him to come down or to get you to come around, but for you to be able to meet in the middle.Talk it out with someone who is trained to guide you through your valid feelings and to guide him through supporting you.Dear Eric: I have a friend I’ve known for more than 40 years. Communication ebbed and flowed as we moved through various life stages. We live hundreds of miles apart now. Her life has been more tumultuous with the death of her husband plus drug and mental health issues with her children.Recently, she has distanced herself from me. I respected her wish to be texted ahead of calling to make sure it was a good time. More often than not, she would promise to call in a few days, but didn't. When we did chat it seemed like old times.Our last contact was a text with her on her birthday last year. She didn’t acknowledge my birthday this year. I know her life is still filled with family drama. I wonder if I should even attempt contact with her anymore.— Distant FriendFriend: Reach out but don’t be afraid to ask a “state of the friendship” question like, “Does this still work for you?”Tell her you notice your communication has ebbed. Ask if it’s intentional. It’s possible — likely — she’s just overwhelmed or not a good communicator.

WaPo_6,Trump suggests Harris would struggle with world leaders based on her appearance,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/trump-harris-play-toy-comment/,2024-07-31 12:00:02.778514,,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that Vice President Harris wouldn’t be able to stand up to world leaders because of her appearance, adding that he didn’t want to spell it out but viewers would know what he meant.“She’ll be like a play toy,” Trump — who has a history of using sexist attacks and stereotypes in campaigns against women — said in a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham, a portion of which aired on Tuesday night. “They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’ They’re going to walk all over her.”Trump then turned to look directly at the camera and added: “And I don’t want to say as to why. But a lot of people understand it.”Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said he was not referring to race or gender and went on to criticize Harris over her record on immigration and other Biden administration policies.“She is weak, dishonest and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” Leavitt said.The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pro-Harris super PAC American Bridge 21st Century called Trump’s remark about how Harris would stack up against world leaders “very gross and weird.”Earlier on Tuesday, the campaign criticized Trump for baselessly accusing Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, of disliking Jewish people.“Donald Trump is hateful, despicable, and should not be our president,” the campaign said in an unsigned statement. “He roots against America. He insults America. Why would we want to put him in charge of America?”Elsewhere in the Fox News interview, Ingraham asked Trump how he would improve life for Black women, whom Harris is energizing. Trump responded by saying that Harris would lead to unsafe streets, and “you’re going to have millions of people coming in taking your job and your husband’s job.”Harris on Tuesday urged Trump to commit to debate her. He has expressed openness to debating but cast doubt on a September date hosted by ABC News that he previously agreed to with President Biden before Biden withdrew from the race.“Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,” she told a packed arena in Atlanta. “As the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.”Trump has habitually criticized the appearance and intelligence of female political opponents, from Carly Fiorina to Hillary Clinton and Nikki Haley. Last week House Republican leaders asked their members not to attack Harris because of her race and identity after several lawmakers dismissed her as a “DEI candidate,” using the abbreviation for “diversity, equity and inclusion.”"

WaPo_8,GAO report says U.S. courts must do more to stop workplace misconduct,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/30/workplace-misconduct-courts-gao-durbin-torres/,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"The body that oversees the federal courts must strengthen its efforts to identify, address and prevent workplace misconduct, the Government Accountability Office concluded in a report released Tuesday.The watchdog agency found that the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has documented more than 500 allegations of workplace misconduct between 2020 and 2022, including nearly 200 allegations of discrimination, most of which involved race, sex or gender.But the report said the court system needs to gather more data on alleged wrongdoing, improve its ability to identify and address potential misconduct, and ensure that such cases are treated the same way as complaints from federal agencies.“No American should suffer sexual misconduct, abuse, or harassment while on the job and the federal Judiciary must be held to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct,” Rep. Norma J. Torres (D-Calif.) said in a statement accompanying the release of the report.“This report is a testament that the current system is failing to protect the over 30,000 employees throughout the federal Judiciary and that reliance on the good character and conduct of individuals alone has been grossly insufficient,” she said.Members of Congress and other advocates for change have long raised concerns about how the judiciary handles allegations of misconduct, including sexual harassment and discrimination.Calls for change escalated after Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by a half-dozen former clerks and low-level employees in 2017.Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who oversees the federal judiciary, moved for the creation of a working group to review workplace conduct policies. Two years later, in 2019, judiciary leaders revised their system for handling harassment complaints.Torres and three other Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (Ill.), asked the GAO to scrutinize those changes and examine whether they align with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s recommended practices to prevent harassment.The GAO found that the court system’s policies did not do so in key ways. For example, the EEOC says trainings should explain to employees the consequences of engaging in prohibited workplace conduct. None of the court-level training materials for judiciary staff included such an explanation, the report said.“Judiciary employees are not covered by various federal civil rights statutes that provide protections for federal employees from discrimination. Instead, they are protected by the judiciary’s policies and can use only those processes developed and applied by the judiciary to address workplace misconduct,” said the report, which acknowledged the steps the judicial system has taken since 2017 to prevent and address workplace misconduct.“[I]t is imperative for the judiciary to ensure that its workplace conduct policies and practices are effectively achieving its goal of creating an exemplary workplace,” the report said.Judge Robert J. Conrad Jr., director of the administrative office, said judiciary leaders would work to address the recommendations.“As in any workplace, continual review and thoughtful revision of workforce protections are needed, and the Judiciary is committed to supporting its more than 30,000 employees by addressing workplace conduct issues promptly and effectively,” Conrad wrote in a letter to the GAO.In its report, the watchdog agency said judiciary leaders limited access to court-system employees, declining a broad request for contact information for all staff so they could participate in the misconduct survey. The GAO interviewed one current and one former employee.Durbin criticized that decision in a statement, saying the administrative office’s “unjustifiable defiance” was in keeping with the agency’s “reticence to embracing meaningful transparency.”A spokesperson for the administrative office said officials refused to provide contact information for court staff, citing its intent to conduct its own survey. The office “also appropriately declined GAO’s request for contact information” for judiciary employees who had filed misconduct complaints, the spokesperson said, because giving out their contact information would have violated their privacy and undermined confidence in the reporting process.The GAO interviewed judges, circuit directors and staff from the administrative office, the Federal Judicial Center and the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in addition to the current and former employee, the spokesperson said.Conrad’s letter, dated May 23, said the judiciary has moved to address workplace concerns by barring abusive conduct and addressing harassing behavior whether or not it is discriminatory. The letter also said that it was updating codes of conduct to clarify confidentiality obligations, remove barriers to reporting, and emphasize the responsibility of all judges and employees to take appropriate action upon learning of potential workplace misconduct.In early 2023, the judiciary administered its own workplace survey to approximately 28,000 employees. Conrad wrote that judiciary leaders plan on using the results “to help inform future recommendations to the Judicial Conference, including any further changes or improvements” to the workplace policies and practices. The survey results were not shared with the GAO.Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), the ranking subcommittee member on the House Judiciary Committee, joined Durbin and Torres in saying more effort is needed. “The fix here is not revolutionary and should not be partisan,” he said in a statement."

She came into Tuesday’s first-round matchup with D.C.’s Hailey Baptiste having failed to complete even two practice sets. She was full of uncertainty.So, of course, the WTA veteran of nearly 20 years was stretched to the limit in a 140-minute grind in the Tuesday afternoon heat at William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park. Ultimately, the former world No. 1 held off Baptiste, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-3).The No. 6 seed, who won exactly one more point than Baptiste in the match, advanced to a second-round meeting with China’s Yafan Wang.“It was hard for me to expect a high level of tennis today after having a break and coming off from injury, not really having too much time on the practice court,” Azarenka said. “But I feel like I fought really hard today. In the tiebreaks, in the important moments, I really executed well.”Despite the win, Azarenka never felt comfortable.“After a break, you have those hesitations, you have some of those doubts,” she said. “Sometimes the quicker decision-making is not as natural after not playing for a while.”Azarenka and Baptiste are coming from opposite ends of their careers. Azarenka turns 35 Wednesday, is ranked No. 20 and has earned nearly $40 million in her career. She finished No. 1 in 2012, the same year Baptiste turned 11.Baptiste is ranked No. 97 and had to win a qualifier just to make the main draw. But once the players were on the court, not much separated the two.The first set took more than 70 minutes. Baptiste led 5-4 and 6-5 but couldn’t close Azarenka out.Azarenka took a 5-2 lead in the first tiebreak, but Baptiste cut her deficit to one. With a chance to even things, Baptiste took a ball on her forehand — a strength of her game — but sent it into the net.The Belarusian eventually won the set with a backhand winner, then won three of the first four games in the next set. Baptiste responded, forced a tiebreak and took a 3-1 lead.But it wouldn’t last. Azarenka won the next six points, celebrating with a reserved fist pump.“I would say it's a good start,” she said.Seconds after he won a marathon second-round match against Daniel Elahi Galan, Frances Tiafoe swung at an errant tennis ball and knocked it out of the stadium. It was unclear whether the blast was in joy or relief, but the Hyattsville native survived a scare after an early stumble for a 6-7 (10-8), 6-3, 6-3 win.“I didn’t feel so good after that first set. … I really found my game, so I hope you guys enjoyed it,” he said in the on-court interview after the match, which lasted 2 hours 22 minutes. His hometown crowd, cheering his every word, did seem to enjoy it.Tiafoe, seeking his first DC Open title, will face the winner of Wednesday’s Roberto Carballes Baena-Aleksandar Kovacevic match in the round of 16.“I think it’s good to have a really tough match in the first round where you’re like, ‘Wow, I could be out of here,’” Tiafoe said. “… Definitely gets your feet going and ready for the tournament. … You get really tested.”For Taylor Townsend, meeting Russian Anastasia Potapova in the first round was a less-than-ideal draw. The pair had met twice, with Potapova dominating both matches.But digging through those losses revealed lessons for Townsend, who turned the tables on Potapova in a 6-2, 6-2 first-round win. She will face Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic in the second round Thursday.Townsend declined to speak with reporters but said in an on-court interview after the match that she and her coach watched plenty of video to prepare for Potapova.“This is the real me,” the 28-year-old said, addressing the crowd. “She’s been hiding for some time.”The win builds on a milestone season for Townsend. She and Katerina Siniakova won the Wimbledon women’s doubles title this month for her first Grand Slam championship."
WaPo_10,Probe finds ‘wasteful spending’ in Montgomery electric school bus effort,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/30/montgomery-electric-school-bus-contract-issues/,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"An electric bus company that was supposed to deliver hundreds of vehicles to the Maryland’s largest school district repeatedly missed delivery deadlines and made late repairs to its vehicles, leading to “millions of dollars in wasteful spending,” according to a report from Montgomery County inspector general criticizing the district’s handling of the contract.Despite the delays, Montgomery County Public Schools did not end its relationship with Highland Electric Fleets — or enforce penalties for the company’s lapses, the inspector general found. Now the district is spending more than $14 million to buy diesel buses as it faces a vehicle shortage.In 2021, the school district pledged to replace 326 of its diesel school buses with electric ones, making it the nation’s largest electric school bus fleet. The school board approved the $168 million project and the system entered a contract with Highland Electric Fleets. The contract stipulated that 25 buses would be available by Aug. 1, 2021, according to the county inspector general.But the buses did not arrive by that date. The school system later reported it received 14 buses in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which ended Dec. 31, 2021. Another 11 were received in the next quarter.A similar pattern occurred during the next two years, the watchdog said, with the contractor not delivering any new buses by Aug. 1, as the contract requires. In addition, mechanical or charging infrastructure issues kept some buses from running, and those issues weren’t repaired within five working days more than 180 times, according to the county watchdog’s report.Duncan McIntyre, chief executive at Highland, said the company has been in constant contact with Montgomery County schools and its contract with the district has been amended to accommodate later deadlines. While McIntyre said he takes “tons” of responsibility for the problems, he also pointed to supply-chain disruptions and manufacturing delays related to the buses it provided for the district.McIntyre disputed the inspector general’s finding that Highland delivered buses late and said the vehicles were delivered within a grace period of multiple months outlined in its contract. Montgomery County schools spokeswoman Liliana López said Tuesday in an email that the school system “will take the necessary steps to address the identified issues,” including “implementing data tracking systems, enhancing management practices, and improving vendor communication and contracts.”“Moving forward, we will be working diligently to refine our contract strategies and internal controls based on their recommendations,” López said.In 2022, Maryland lawmakers passed a law aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including growing the number of electric vehicles in the state. The measure also requires school buses purchased in fiscal 2025 to run exclusively on electric power — although the state is offering waivers to this requirement.That year, Monifa McKnight, then superintendent of Montgomery County Public Schools, said the district would save “upwards of 6,500 gallons of diesel fuel per day” and cut costs in half by switching to electric school buses, according to the report.The inspector general said the school district was supposed to receive the 326 electric buses over a four-year period ending in 2025.The report said Highland initially agreed to deliver 120 buses for the 2024-25 school year. But McIntyre said the contract had to be updated after a manufacturer delay on small buses. Now, just 30 buses will be delivered this upcoming school year and the remaining 90 will come next year, he said.The inspector general’s report says under the amended contract, some buses will potentially not come into use until the 2026-27 school year.McIntyre said the mechanical issues — which have included battery replacements and high-voltage related issues — are common. School districts in Baltimore city and county, which also work with Highland, reported similar problems, he said.“There are certainly examples where repairs took longer than they should have,” McIntyre said about the Montgomery County fleet. He also said the company is training more of its employees to do repairs. “The industry is relatively new and developing its supply chain.”Still, the county watchdog’s office calculated the school system could have charged the company about $372,000 in fees for the problems but failed to do so.Montgomery County Public Schools’s practices within its transportation department has been scrutinized the past few years for issues unrelated to the electric bus fleet. In 2021, Montgomery County police investigated the transportation department for potential financial improprieties. A state audit and separate county inspector general investigation found that employees frequently misused county-issued purchasing cards and the department maintained an “off the books” vendor account with American Truck & Bus, a contractor that provides buses.In 2023, a former assistant director of the transportation department, Charles Ewald, pleaded guilty to a felony theft scheme that exceeded $100,000 and misconduct in office. The former director, Todd Watkins, pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in office in part for his role in setting up an “off-the-books” vendor account, which prosecutors argued allowed Ewald to steal money from the school system."
WaPo_11,U.S. military launches first airstrike in Iraq in months,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/30/iraq-airstrike-iran-gaza/,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"U.S. forces carried out an airstrike in Iraq on Tuesday night, targeting unspecified “combatants” attempting to launch a one-way attack drone, officials said.The incident followed attacks on American positions in Iraq and Syria in recent days, officials said, ending what had been months of relative calm between U.S. forces and militias there that are supported by Iran.U.S. officials said the airstrike happened in Musayib, a town south of Baghdad, but disclosed few other details. A defense official said in a brief statement that “based on recent attacks in Iraq and Syria,” U.S. military officials assessed that the activity constituted a threat to American and coalition forces. Like some others, this official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation.“This action underscores the United States’ commitment to the safety and security of our personnel,” the statement said. “We maintain the inherent right to self-defense and will not hesitate to take appropriate action.”A second defense official said the airstrike followed three attacks on U.S. forces in recent days. On Thursday, two rockets targeted al-Asad Air Base in Iraq and another struck on or near a U.S. outpost in Syria, the official said. The following day, two additional rockets targeted the facility in Syria, Mission Support Site Euphrates. No damage or injuries were reported in any of those incidents, the official said.U.S. officials have long feared that Israel’s war in Gaza could spill over into other parts of the Middle East, where Iran enjoys considerable influence.Tuesday’s airstrike, reported earlier by Reuters, follows a spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian-backed group in Lebanon.Earlier in the day, Israel carried out an airstrike in a busy neighborhood on the outskirts of Beirut, saying it had killed a senior Hezbollah commander responsible for an attack Saturday that killed 12 children in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Lebanese Health Ministry said the attack killed a woman and two children. Hezbollah denied it was responsible for the weekend attack.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking to reporters after meeting with officials in the Philippines on Tuesday, expressed hope for a diplomatic resolution to avoid a full-blown conflict but said the United States will defend Israel if it is attacked by Hezbollah. “We’ve been clear about that,” he said.In the weeks after Hamas-led militants launched a deadly cross-border attack into Israel on Oct. 7, spawning the ongoing war in Gaza, other militant groups backed by Iran started attacking U.S. military positions in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, linking their violence to Washington’s support for Israel. The militias in Iraq and Syria, along with the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Hamas in Gaza, are all part of the same network and are provided weapons and training by Iran, U.S. officials have said.In February, after at least 165 attacks on U.S. forces, the Biden administration approved airstrikes in response to, and to avenge, the deaths of three U.S. soldiers killed in a one-way drone strike on their base in Jordan.Tuesday’s airstrike in Iraq occurred as U.S. and Iraqi officials negotiate a possible withdrawal of at least some of the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. An additional 900 troops are based in Syria, with a mission to counter the Islamic State, and are reliant on personnel in Iraq for logistical help."
WaPo_12,Latest FAFSA hiccup could delay financial aid disbursements this fall,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/30/some-students-to-get-financial-aid-late/,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"The Education Department said Tuesday that colleges cannot submit corrections to students’ financial aid records in bulk this year, a decision that could leave some students unable to pay their bills before classes start in the coming weeks.This is the latest setback in the tumultuous launch of the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, an effort that has been plagued by processing errors and delays that prevented millions of students from completing the form and receiving timely aid offers. Now some of those students could face a new hurdle in getting the financial support needed to attain their degrees.Colleges have been waiting months for the department to let them send batches of corrected FAFSA records. The function is usually available when the application goes live and makes it easier for financial aid offices to move quickly through the aid process, especially those that need to send hundreds or thousands of corrected records.Corrections include adjustments to award packages for families contending with a job loss, salary reduction or other circumstances that make it hard to pay for school. Those changes must be completed before final aid offers can be issued and disbursements can be made to students. Without the ability to submit corrections in bulk, colleges will have to manually make changes, a time-consuming process that could delay the disbursements.“The Department’s poor planning has led to a stunning failure,” said Beth Maglione, interim president and chief executive of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “Some college students might not have financial aid dollars in their hands in time to start classes in the next few weeks. And for schools, the impact of today’s announcement means more than a few extra hours of work. It’s the difference between pushing a button versus making thousands of keystrokes in terms of administrative burden.”The Education Department said over 2,800 colleges have successfully submitted individual corrections since it launched the portal earlier this month. Still, the agency said it recognizes the time sensitivity and extra administrative burden for institutions and will offer technical assistance to help schools with the process.“We know this decision creates additional burdens for institutions that are already experiencing a heavy workload and increased demands during this extraordinary FAFSA processing cycle,” the department said in an announcement to higher education professionals Tuesday.Initially, the Education Department said colleges could submit corrections in bulk in July, only to push the date back to August. In Tuesday’s announcement, the department said it decided to scrap batch corrections this year because many schools could not utilize them before they began their fall semesters. The department said it is also prioritizing the development of “a well-tested, robust, and end-to-end launch of the 2025-26 form” and needs to ensure resources are focused appropriately.Tuesday’s announcement arrives a week after NASFAA and four other associations wrote Education Secretary Miguel Cardona urging him to deliver a fully functioning FAFSA, even if it means delaying the rollout by two months. The recommendation comes as congressional Republicans have introduced legislation requiring the form be available on Oct. 1, which has been the traditional launch date since 2016. Some associations worry that the mandate could result in another piecemeal rollout to the detriment of students and colleges."
WaPo_13,Mark Kelly could help Harris on a challenging issue: Immigration,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/mark-kelly-vp-choice-kamala-harris-immigration/,2024-07-31 11:00:02.778514,,"In June, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona was the only Senate Democrat to stand alongside President Biden as he announced a new executive order aimed at cracking down on asylum seekers.“I’m happy to be here today, and what I hope is that we will have a safer situation and operational control over our southern border,” Kelly told reporters outside the White House that day.Kelly’s eagerness to associate himself with a tough border measure just weeks ago is now suddenly seen as his greatest asset as he vies to become Kamala Harris’s running mate in a transformed presidential race against Donald Trump following President Biden’s sudden exit from the contest. The two-term senator and former NASA astronaut is fluent in and brings some credibility to what’s perceived as Harris’s weakest issue as a candidate: security of America’s southern border.“When it comes down to it, [Kelly] has a record that can really protect against a withering, brutal assault on the border on her that’s going to be coming,” said political operative Mike Madrid, who worked on GOP campaigns in California and later co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. “You can’t lose by 35 points on the border to Trump and win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.”Trump is already going on offense against Harris on immigration — his first ad targeting the likely Democratic nominee focused on her record on immigration and called her “dangerously liberal.” Harris has received an onslaught of criticism for her role, assigned by Biden, seeking to combat the root causes of migration to the United States from Central America, with Republicans calling her Biden’s “border czar.” Illegal border crossings have soared during Biden’s presidency, though they dropped sharply in recent weeks because of the shift in administration policy.Some hope that Kelly, who declined an interview request through a spokesman, can help inoculate Harris on an issue that Trump is certain to make a linchpin of his reelection campaign.Amanda Renteria, a top aide to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, said choosing Kelly would “broaden” the Democratic ticket by diversifying the experience on it. Kelly is a former U.S. Navy pilot who flew combat missions in the Gulf War, and he would represent a stylistic departure from Harris. “It shows her choice to bring on people that are different from her,” Renteria said. “It’s a huge contrast to Donald Trump and JD Vance.”While many of Kelly’s Democratic colleagues railed against Trump’s desire to build a wall on the southern border and criticized him from the left on immigration during his presidency, Kelly has sounded an entirely different note. He pushed the Biden administration to help close gaps in the border wall in the Yuma, Ariz., sector in 2021, and in 2022 criticized Biden’s decision to lift a pandemic-era policy allowing officials to turn away asylum seekers as “dumb.”Kelly has not spearheaded meaningful legislation on immigration during his short time in the Senate, but he was a vocal proponent of the bipartisan border deal that ultimately failed in February amid Republican opposition. He has built deep relationships with border officials, law enforcement and migrant rights activists in Arizona, giving him a rare fluency on the issue, according to observers. Even some officials who criticize Harris for what they see as a lack of concern about border communities praise Kelly for supporting increased border resources.But Kelly has weaknesses of his own as a vice-presidential pick. Biden and Harris have underperformed in Arizona vs. Trump so far, casting doubt on whether Kelly could deliver a swing state. He also only has four years of political experience, none of it executive, and some union leaders have raised concerns that he is not sufficiently pro-labor.So far, Kelly has been less present on the campaign trail and cable TV than some of the other vice-presidential contenders, including Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who co-headlined a Harris event Monday in Ambler, Pa.Since his name was floated, packs of reporters have trailed Kelly around the Capitol and given him the opportunity to audition for the traditional veep attack dog role — even as he declines to say whether he wants the job. Instead, Kelly has shifted the focus to Trump’s own running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), whom he called “backward” for his opposition to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia.“I think it’s one of the most important issues that we’re going to face here in a generation and what happens in Ukraine is going to affect us in our national security,” Kelly said last week.Kelly is slated to appear on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday morning ahead of Vance’s swing through Arizona, which will take him to Glendale and later the border.Kelly and Harris have spoken since Biden announced he was stepping aside, according to a person with knowledge of the phone call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Harris is slated to pick her running mate before Aug. 7, when the Democratic Party will nominate its presidential ticket using a virtual process.“Vice President Harris has directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates,” a Harris campaign spokesperson said. “That process has begun in earnest and we do not expect to have additional updates until the vice president announces who will be serving as her running mate.”Kelly’s wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), appeared in Grand Rapids, Mich., for Harris on Monday. After suffering a near-fatal gunshot wound in 2011, Giffords became a leading activist against gun violence, with Kelly co-founding a national gun-control group that carries his wife’s name.While not known as a particularly energizing public speaker, Kelly has been in high demand as a surrogate for other Democrats this campaign cycle, including Harris before she was elevated to the top of the ticket. Several of his Senate colleagues are eager to be seen with him.“She is, without a doubt, one of the best, most bipartisan senators in the United States Senate,” Kelly said while appearing at a rally for Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) in June.He’s a prolific fundraiser and is battle-tested after winning two fiercely contested Senate races by margins of roughly two to five percentage points, first during a special election in 2020 and then in 2022, when he secured a full six-year term. Republicans threw a mountain of opposition research at him both times, trying to cast suspicion on his transformation from Giffords’s husband to a wealthy politician with business ties to China. Kelly won both times and had — until recently — been enjoying the freedom of not running for reelection, he has told colleagues.In the Senate, the Arizona Democrat has focused on national security issues; he serves on both the Intelligence and the Armed Services committees. He was also a part of the negotiations that resulted in the bipartisan Chips and Science Act, which boosted manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States to counter China’s influence.Kelly also bluntly clashed with Sen. Tommy Tuberville (Ala.) when the Republican held up military promotions over objections to allowing service members to be reimbursed for travel related to abortions, saying it didn’t make “sense” that Tuberville, who is not a veteran, insisted he was the most “military” person on the Armed Services Committee.But it is Kelly’s style on immigration that some Democrats think would make him a unique asset to the presidential ticket.Much like Arizona’s other senator, Kyrsten Sinema, an independent, Kelly long has distanced himself from Democrats’ handling of border security. During his 2020 campaign, Kelly frequently told supporters that more border security and resources were necessary to aid towns dealing with a flood of asylum seekers. He noted that the debate over undocumented immigration and resources in Arizona had been going on for decades — through Democratic and Republican administrations alike.“When Democrats are wrong, like on the border, I call them out on it, because I’m always going to stick up for Arizona,” Kelly said during a 2022 campaign debate.Despite speaking differently than many Democrats on the border, Kelly’s legislative record is slim on the issue given Washington has been virtually deadlocked on it. Sinema, a former immigration lawyer and veteran dealmaker, has often taken the lead on Washington’s border efforts, including the failed bipartisan compromise to crack down on border crossings. Kelly supported the deal but was not deeply involved in crafting it.Additionally, Kelly co-sponsored legislation aimed at helping border officials combat fentanyl trafficking that became law earlier this year, and helped pass a measure with Sinema aimed at boosting agents who patrol tribal lands for drug smugglers.Kelly slammed his Republican colleagues for voting against the compromise after Trump opposed it, calling it a “shameful” day for the Senate. “This isn’t just a political talking point for me or my state. It’s a reality we live every single day,” he said.It’s that sort of blunt assessment of Washington’s attitude toward the issue that could carry broad appeal in both Rust Belt and Sun Belt states, said Adam Kinsey, an Arizona Democratic consultant.“He understands how [the border] operates, how it works, he understands the challenges, the pressure points based on who he represents,” Kinsey said. “It’s more real, more visceral for him than it is for a senator who isn’t on the border.”Republicans are skeptical Kelly can boost Harris on the border. “Regardless of how much they try to say she was not the czar, she was clearly leading point on this issue,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.). “I don’t think on that particular policy issue that she can get away from it.”Back home in Arizona, Kelly has built a powerful political brand in the swing state, where he performed well with Latino voters in his 2022 race, a key constituency for Harris as she plots a path to victory in 2024. Sixty-eight percent of Latinos backed his candidacy, according to an analysis by the progressive-voter-file company Catalist. That was higher than the 63 percent of Arizona Latino voters who backed Biden-Harris in 2020.“In 2022, he beat every statewide [candidate] on the ticket by several points,” said Catalist adviser Haris Aqeel, referring to his performance with all voters.Kelly, who lives about an hour north of the border in Tucson, has cultivated a reputation for accessibility on border issues, and is well known among border officials. He often flies himself around border communities in the vast desert state to both get in pilot hours and visit his constituents and elected officials. He stresses the need for more resources and better enforcement while also speaking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform to provide a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.“He’s well educated, well versed on the topic,” said Yavapai County Sheriff David Rhodes, a Republican. “He’s been a good conduit of information and he is approachable — he does get back to us.”Rhodes contrasted that with Harris.“We haven’t heard a single word from Vice President Harris,” Rhodes said, referencing the diplomatic role Biden gave her to address the root causes of migration from Central America. “I don’t know exactly what she was told to do, but we have not seen or heard from her on the border in Arizona.”Tyler Pager contributed to this report."
WaPo_14,Harris holds raucous rally in Atlanta as she and Trump battle for Georgia,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/harris-raucous-rally-atlanta/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"ATLANTA — Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, held a raucous rally here Tuesday night and challenged Republican Donald Trump to debate her, as both the Harris and Trump campaigns are refocusing attention on this pivotal Southern state amid a political map that could be reshaped by newfound Democratic energy.Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), will appear at a rally in the same venue Saturday, the Trump campaign said, marking two dueling rallies in a state increasingly at play. President Biden, who narrowly captured Georgia in 2020, had been considered by many Democrats a long shot to win it again, but that calculus could change if Harris can energize the state’s voters.“I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,” Harris said. “You all helped us win in 2020, and we’re going to do it again in 2024.”In a sign of the shifting landscape, the organizers of Project 2025, which was intended as a blueprint for an incoming Trump administration but has become a rallying cry for Democrats, announced it was ending its policy work. Democrats have seized on Project 2025 in an effort to tie Trump to policy proposals such as eliminating the Education Department and limiting access to abortion pills, while the Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from the document.In a new interview, Trump also suggested that Harris cannot hold her own with world leaders.“They’ll walk all over her. She’ll be so easy for them. She’ll be like a play toy,” Trump said in an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News. “They’re going to walk all over her. And I don’t want to say as to why, but a lot of people understand it.”Harris is planning a tour of battleground states next week with her soon-to-be-named running mate, according to a campaign official, with plans to stop in Philadelphia; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix; Las Vegas; and western Wisconsin. Her campaign has signaled that she would announce her vice-presidential pick by Aug. 7, though her choice could be unveiled sooner.“Not yet,” she said, when asked as she boarded Air Force Two to fly to Atlanta if she had chosen her running mate.Ahead of Harris’s rally, crowds snaked around the Georgia State Convocation Center for hours, with sweaty attendees moving at a snail’s pace in the 90-degree heat — a scene that until recently was more familiar at Trump’s rallies. The Harris campaign ultimately announced a crowd count of 10,000 people.It was the campaign’s largest rally to date, boisterous and energetic in ways the Democratic Party has arguably not seen for years. If not for the “Harris for President” signs everywhere, the convention hall could have been mistaken for a concert venue. The crowd did the wave. Chalie Boy,  Frankie Beverly and Maze, and Beyoncé thumped from the speakers. Attendees “dougied,” a hip-hop dance. The event featured Georgia’s most prominent politicians as well as rappers Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion.Where Biden often quotes Irish poets in his speeches, Harris quoted Quavo in hers.She mentioned Trump’s name often, a dozen times or more, but never mentioned Biden, even as she brought up many of the policy aims of the Biden-Harris administration. She chastised Trump for urging Republicans to vote against a bipartisan immigration package this year and vowed to pass it if she is elected.“He tanked — tanked — the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election,” Harris said, “which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.”She mocked his policy positions — called him and his running mate “just plain weird” — and mocked him for not fully committing to a debate. “Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider, to meet me on the debate stage,” she said. “Because as the saying goes, ‘If you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.’”Recent days have seen a remarkable shift in the dynamics of the 2024 presidential campaign, since Biden announced July 21 he was ending his bid for reelection and endorsing Harris as his replacement. Few states reflect that change more than Georgia.Biden narrowly won the state in 2020, becoming the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992, while Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael G. Warnock secured the state’s two U.S. Senate seats.But as the 2024 campaign ramped up, many Democrats privately admitted they saw Georgia as a lost cause, especially after Biden’s dismal debate performance June 27. Harris has reoriented the campaign, and Democrats hope she can motivate young, non-White and college-educated voters, notably in the Atlanta area, and close the gap with Trump.As both sides recalibrated to adjust to the new landscape, Anita Dunn, a top adviser in Biden’s White House and architect of his 2020 campaign, announced she would leave the White House next week to advise Future Forward, the largest super PAC supporting Harris.Harris’s campaign unveiled its first television ad Tuesday in what it said would be a $50 million buy in battleground states ahead of the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19-22. The new ad — which will run during coverage of the Olympics, as well as popular shows such as “The Bachelorette,” “Big Brother” and “The Simpsons” — begins by flashing images of Harris from childhood to adulthood before focusing on her track record in public office.“As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,” a narrator says. “As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.”The ad also includes a clip from a campaign rally in Milwaukee in which Harris says, “This campaign is about who we fight for.”The Trump campaign’s first television ad of the general election, also released Tuesday, attacks Harris as an evasive, weak and distracted leader who did not protect the U.S.-Mexico border from drug trafficking, increased migrant crossings and a possible terrorism threat during the Biden administration.“Kamala Harris. Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,” the ad concludes.The Trump campaign made a two-week, $12 million purchase Monday of broadcast, cable and digital airtime across Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin, according to the tracking firm AdImpact.Equally notable were the continued efforts to distance Trump from Project 2025. The Heritage Foundation, which organized the project, said it was winding down its policy operations — a move that came after Trump senior adviser Susie Wiles repeatedly urged Heritage leaders to stop promoting Project 2025 and Trump strategist Chris LaCivita repeatedly disavowed it.“President Trump’s campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way,” Wiles and LaCivita said in a joint statement Tuesday. “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.”But Democrats noted that many of the contributors to Project 2025 were former high-ranking Trump officials and that the effort was explicitly intended to pave the way for the next Republican administration. Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said Democrats will not stop talking about Project 2025.“Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real — in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding,” Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country.”While Harris’s running mate has yet to be named, Vance is on a Western swing this week, fundraising in California and hosting rallies in battleground states Nevada and Arizona.During remarks at a high school gymnasium in Henderson, Nev., Vance on Tuesday made several references to Trump “taking a bullet” for his country, referring to an attempted assassination this month. During his rally speech, Vance drew parallels to his own time in the Marines. Several supporters wore hats that said “Bulletproof Trump 2024.”“Do you want a president who is disloyal to this country? Or do you want one who is willing to take a bullet for it?” Vance asked.He also called Harris “dangerously liberal” and referred to the quick coalescing of support from Democrats as a “coup.”“The media … for years has said the Republicans are a threat to democracy,” Vance said, referring to attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “They’re calling it a coronation [of Harris]. I’ve got a different word for it: I call it a coup.”Supporters at the rally insisted that Vance’s comments about the societal value of women without children — whom he described as “childless cat ladies” — have been taken out of context by the media and Democrats.Lisa Cassel, 55, said Harris likely becoming Democratic nominee has only increased her support for the Trump-Vance ticket. “So many of her positions are so radical. I’m just not ready for her yet. That’s not the America I live in,” Cassel said.Sam Brown, the Republican Senate candidate in Nevada, who took the stage before Vance, gave his full endorsement of Trump’s new running mate before turning to attack Harris.“We’ve all been impacted by her failed leadership on the border, we’ve all been failed by the policy on our economy,” Brown said. “We’ve all been impacted by their failed policy on energy.”Ahead of Vance’s first campaign visit to Nevada, the local Harris campaign hosted reproductive rights advocates on Monday, attacking Trump’s position that abortion laws should be left up to individual states.“Leaving it to the states means you support the worst and the most restrictive of all the laws that have been passed,” said Rep. Dina Titus (Nev.), who alongside fellow Democrat state Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui introduced herself as “childless cat lady.”“I’m here to tell JD Vance, we don’t want you in Nevada,” Titus told reporters.Abbie Cheeseman, Tyler Pager, Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey and Isaac Arnsdorf contributed to this report."
WaPo_15,Rugby star Ilona Maher is much more than an influencer. She’s a winner.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/30/ilona-maher-rugby-tiktok/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"SAINT-DENIS, France — Ilona Maher put one foot up and leaned against a metal railing. She touched the bronze medal dangling around her neck, trying to relax. She couldn’t. So she started talking really loud and really fast.“IT HASN’T REALLY SUNK IN YET. I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S HAPPENING,” she said, and she spoke those 11 words as if they were one.Eventually, she took a breath. Joy had left her disheveled, a rare state for a woman whose life plays out on social media, often through clever videos. But she wasn’t a star Tuesday night. She was a captain, the leader of the U.S. women’s rugby sevens team. If anyone ever dared to doubt her priorities, Maher became more than an athletic content creator Tuesday night at Stade de France, more than a social media maven TikTok-ing into flimsy fame.You can consider her an influencer, but first you must refer to her by a title that motivates her the most: winner.With a heart-stopping finish, the United States needed every second to defeat Australia, 14-12, in the bronze medal game. It ended with Alex “Spiff” Sedrick scoring on a long try as time expired and then putting a kick through the uprights to clinch the first rugby sevens Olympic medal in American history.“I mean, I’ll give my firstborn child to Spiff,” Maher said.Maher is the one we’ll remember, but Sedrick was the hero. That’s rugby. It’s a tough, fast, physical team game that isn’t over even when it should be.In the sevens variation of the sport, the competition is a short, 15-minute test of tenacity. Maher has created a platform with millions of followers on Instagram and TikTok because of her humorous videos, vibrant personality and candor. But she sets herself apart with vulnerability, never shying from any topic, including how she learned to appreciate her body.She’s strong, muscular and fierce. She’s silly, too. She’s just Ilona, a rugby star with a following and a mission to welcome others to her sport. During this Olympic run, she befriended Jason Kelce, the recently retired Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman. He wore a shirt with a repeated pattern of Maher’s face and the American flag Tuesday, copying from the Maher family wardrobe. With Kelce as a hype man and the team making history with an unforgettable final play, the sport has an opportunity to grow its popularity.“We wanted to do this to show what rugby could be in America,” Maher said. “And we had to prove our worth because America loves medals. They love winning, and it was really important for us to do this to show that we can be something and to get other young girls to aspire to do this.”Maher admitted to feeling pressure. She talked with a sports psychologist throughout this run, trying to remain centered.Her online persona had helped her become one of the more recognizable American faces at an Olympics full of superstar talent.She has an addictive charm. Maher, a 27-year-old from Burlington, Vt., played college rugby at Quinnipiac and graduated with a nursing degree. She played for the U.S. team three years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, but she came to Paris anointed an athlete to watch. Despite all her charisma, she was concerned about meeting expectations.“I stayed centered by knowing I’m not alone out there,” Maher said. “I play a team sport, and that’s what makes it special. If I’m not on my best game, I know somebody else might be on their best game. I think that makes me feel grounded because, I mean, I knocked the ball on there, I missed the tackle there. But it’s not just about you, and I need to remember that because I put it all on myself sometimes. Being on a team, though, is really awesome.”Without Sedrick, Maher wouldn’t be able to celebrate. A gymnastics coach gave Sedrick the nickname “Spiff” when she was younger because she had a spiffy energy about her. The name has stuck. Sedrick prefers “Spiff” to “Alex.” After completing a full-field, walk-off try, she can go by any name she wishes.“One minute for the rest of her life,” teammate Kristi Kirshe marveled. “That’s a life-changing moment for all of us and for rugby in America.”Maher invited as many people as she could to rugby sevens. The team made the most of the attention. Considering that Maher was able to elevate interest before the United States stepped onto a medal podium, you can expect her to leverage this breakthrough in a most incredible — and entertaining — way.“So I think people come to the Olympics like, ‘Okay, I’m going to make something myself,’ and I do that as well. But I did it by just being myself, and that’s who I am,” Maher said. “So I think it’s like really being authentic because people can tell that, and I think people really resonate with it. But there’s a lot of pressure now. ... That’s in our culture of, you know, I have this pressure now to do everything right and to want to say the right thing. So I am nervous in that way, and I am trying to protect myself in that way as well.”Eventually, she will get comfortable with this new level of stardom.Before Tuesday, some may have separated the athlete and influencer. For certain, they have merged now. Maher is one spectacular, interest-generating machine, and unlike Olympians who see their celebrity vanish, she’s not going to fade away."
WaPo_16,"Nats trade Dylan Floro, hold on to Kyle Finnegan at deadline",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/30/nationals-trade-deadline-dylan-floro/,2024-07-31 13:00:02.778514,,"PHOENIX — Heading into Tuesday’s MLB trade deadline, two arms in the Washington Nationals’ bullpen remained logical candidates to be moved: right-hander Dylan Floro and closer Kyle Finnegan.When the 6 p.m. deadline passed, Washington had sent Floro to the Arizona Diamondbacks, the team it faced later that night. But Finnegan, who is under team control through the 2025 season, remained.“I’m happy to be a National and that we can put this behind us and focus on winning games,” Finnegan said. “I was at peace with whatever happened, so I’m happy to be here.”As for Tuesday’s contest, Patrick Corbin became the first player in Nationals history to allow 11 runs in an outing in Washington’s 17-0 loss. The margin of defeat also was the largest in Nationals history.Corbin’s final line included 13 hits allowed over three innings of work. Ten of the 11 runs he surrendered were earned. Arizona’s Eugenio Suárez blasted three home runs while the Nationals had four hits total. Arizona finished with 19 hits.“It seemed like, whatever I really did tonight, it found a hole,” said Corbin. “Already watched it. I’ll just try to move on from it, focus on things I’ve done well and look to the next one.”This is the third year Finnegan’s name has surfaced around the trade deadline. He has learned to focus despite the noise but admitted he was following the day’s many trades in the final few hours. He wasn’t sure he was safe until Manager Dave Martinez called him into his office and told him he was, in fact, staying.“It was weird: He had kind of a look on his face like he didn’t believe me,” Martinez said. “It’s nice that he’s still here and he’s still going to get the opportunity to save games for us.”Floro thought Martinez was joking when the manager told him he was heading basically across the field to join the Diamondbacks’ dugout. Arizona sent minor league infielder Andrés Chaparro to Washington for Floro.The Nationals signed Floro, 33, to a one-year contract in December, hoping he could bounce back from a subpar 2023 with Miami and Minnesota. The right-hander had a 2.06 ERA in 51 appearances and proved to be one of the Nationals’ best relievers.“I’ve seen it before, but it’s a little weird, a little different with myself being in their shoes,” Floro said of being traded. “… Came here to get ready for a game. Just going to be doing it in a different uniform.”In Chaparro, the Nationals acquired a third baseman from the Diamondbacks’ Class AAA affiliate who has made massive strides this season, hitting .332 with 19 home runs and a .967 OPS. The 25-year-old was not listed on any major publications’ lists of Arizona’s top 30 prospects.In total, Washington traded four players this month, including 28-year-old outfielder Lane Thomas, who on Monday was dealt to the Cleveland Guardians. Ahead of the all-star break, reliever Hunter Harvey departed for Kansas City. On Saturday, outfielder Jesse Winker was traded to the New York Mets.“We thought we filled a lot of our objectives at the trade deadline,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said. “We got a deeper minor league system. We feel like we got a couple of impact players. I think that it’s going to prove to be very beneficial long term.”It was another step in Washington’s rebuild, a years-long process that has included the midsummer departures of several players over the past four seasons, including some beloved stars and household names. In 2021, ace Max Scherzer and shortstop Trea Turner were dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers. And in 2022, Washington traded star outfielder Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres.Through it all, the Nationals have revamped their minor league system and shifted their focus to the future. Some players who arrived in those seismic deals — including left-hander MacKenzie Gore, shortstop CJ Abrams and outfielder James Wood — have already given fans hope. And this month, the Nationals added seven more players to their system.Harvey netted minor league infielder Cayden Wallace and the 39th pick in the draft, which turned into catcher Caleb Lomavita. Right-hander Tyler Stuart arrived in the Winker deal. And Cleveland sent Washington infielders José Tena and Rafael Ramirez Jr. and left-hander Alex Clemmey in the Thomas trade.To fill out their major league roster, the Nationals called up outfielder Travis Blankenhorn to take Thomas’s spot. Martinez said he anticipates Blankenhorn and Alex Call to split time in right, though Blankenhorn also could see time as the designated hitter.With Floro and Harvey gone, Martinez will need bigger contributions from some of the relievers at the back end of his bullpen. Washington called up Joan Adon to replace Floro; Adon primarily has been used as a starter in the majors, but the Nationals have transitioned him into a long relief role. He pitched 1⅓ innings Tuesday and allowed one run on Suarez’s third homer of the night.In late-game, high-leverage situations, Martinez said he could turn to former closer Tanner Rainey, who has struggled this season, posting a 5.90 ERA entering Tuesday. Rainey got an opportunity in the ninth inning Tuesday and allowed three runs.Even with the uncertainty, one thing is clear: The Nationals will have Finnegan close for the rest of the season.“I hope to continue to play well, and I’m inspired to finish the season strong and get ready for next year,” Finnegan said."

No other candidate met the threshold of securing 300 delegate signatures.Harris is also expected to announce a running mate soon, and when she does the party will declare them the official ticket that will appear on ballots.Parties traditionally nominate their presidential ticket at a convention, but Democrats chose to hold an earlier vote, citing concerns over ballot access deadlines in some states and an overly litigious Republican Party that could challenge them if they were missed. The Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago from Aug. 19 to 22.Election experts have said there’s no evidence to suggest states wouldn’t have worked with the party to ensure their candidates appeared on the ballots."
WaPo_18,Trump’s nephew says comment disparaging the disabled led to his new book,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/30/fred-trump-book-disabled-comment/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"Fred Trump III kept silent for years about his uncle, former president Donald Trump. And when his sister, Mary L. Trump, wrote a 2020 bestseller calling their uncle “the world’s most dangerous man,” he called the book “a breach of trust and a violation of our privacy,” adding that “We consider our family matters to be private.”Yet Tuesday marked the release of Fred Trump III’s own book, in which he does an about-face to take on his uncle and recount a deeply dysfunctional extended family.The turning point, Fred Trump III said, was an Oval Office conversation about his son William, who has physical and mental disabilities, in which the president said about people with disabilities, “The shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.”That was the last time he talked with his uncle, Fred Trump III said in an interview Tuesday with The Washington Post, setting him on the path to write “All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way.” He said he planned to vote for the likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Harris, and that, if asked, he would campaign against his uncle and speak at the Democratic National Convention.“I have stayed quiet for a very long time,” said the 61-year-old Fred Trump III. “I’m one of the only people that knows Donald from his formative years to his business career to the White House.”With that background, he said, he set out to write “a three-dimensional book. It’s the good, the bad and the jaw-dropping.”Former president Trump, in a statement to The Post, said he had helped Fred Trump III, contributed to a fund to help William Trump, and also introduced Fred Trump III to government officials from the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere who might be helpful.“I helped him so much, more than anyone else in his life, and this is the thanks I get. I even set up [a] meeting with NIH and top doctors in the country talking about his son, who is disabled,” Donald Trump said in the statement. He said that Mary Trump “convinced him to do this.”But Fred Trump III said that he has not talked to Mary since her book published. She could not be reached for comment.Donald Trump and his spokesman did not respond directly to a question about Fred Trump III’s assertion about his comments regarding disabled people.Fred Trump III said the book is, by design, a nuanced and somewhat gentler view than his sister’s volume. He recounts the many disputes within the family but saved the toughest comments about Donald Trump and his views on people with disabilities until the final pages. That episode fits his conclusion that Donald Trump has an innate lack of empathy.The backstory to both Mary and Fred Trump III’s books is Donald Trump’s relationship with their father — his older brother — Fred “Freddie” Trump Jr., who died in 1981 of an alcoholism-related illness at age 42.Donald Trump, who rarely admits mistakes, told The Post in 2019 that he regrets having tried to press his brother to abandon his work as a TWA pilot and join the family company, telling Fred Jr. “you’re wasting your time.” Donald Trump said in The Post interview that “I do regret having put pressure on him.”Fred Trump III, asked in the interview whether he blames Donald Trump’s pressure for contributing to his father’s struggles, responded, “Yes, I do,” saying that “my father became an airline pilot flying a 707. You know, in those days, pilots were sort of heroes along with the astronauts.” Instead of accepting his brother’s decision, “Donald continued to beat down my father. And that’s unfortunate,” Fred Trump III said.When the family patriarch, Fred Trump Sr., died in 1999, years after being diagnosed with dementia, Fred Trump III and his sister, Mary Trump, expected they would receive a portion of the estate that would have gone to their father.Instead, after Fred Trump III and Mary Trump were told that they would be getting far less than they expected if there had been an equal division of the estate, they sued Donald Trump and two of his siblings, alleging that they had taken advantage of Fred Trump Sr.’s dementia and gotten him to change the will.Donald Trump and his siblings denied the allegation and responded by cutting off family medical insurance that was crucial for the care of Fred Trump III’s son. Donald Trump said at the time to the New York Daily News, “When [Fred Trump III] sued us, we said, ‘Why should give him medical care?’”The feud escalated as Fred Trump III said in a court case that Donald Trump and his siblings “thought nothing about taking away my critically ill son’s coverage in an attempt to browbeat me in to abandoning my claim in the probate contest.”Fred Trump III and his sister, Mary, eventually settled their suit under a confidentiality agreement.With the publication of Mary’s book, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man,” the first public crack appeared among the Trumps, but no one else in the family joined her criticism. She based her book in part on secret tape recordings of her aunt Maryanne Trump Barry, first reported in 2020 by The Post, in which Donald Trump’s sister said her brother has “no principles” and that “you can’t trust him.”Fred Trump III, who often visited Barry, wrote in his book that she told him in 2016 that she was writing an op-ed urging people to vote against Donald Trump, but the opinion piece was never published for reasons that are not known. Fred Trump III recalled seeing Barry writing the op-ed on a yellow legal pad and that it said “he’s just not fit to be president.” Barry died in 2023.Fred Trump III said in the interview that, to this day, he has not read his sister’s book.While the relationship between Mary and Fred Trump III frayed, he stayed in regular touch with Donald Trump after his 2016 election, visiting him about a dozen times at the Oval Office, he said in the interview, despite differing politics. Fred Trump III said he voted for Democrats Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 — but refrained from publicly speaking out against his uncle.He said that Donald Trump voluntarily and regularly contributed an undisclosed amount to a fund to help pay for his son’s medical expenses.Donald Trump, meanwhile, said in his 2019 interview with The Post that his dispute with Fred Trump III was in the past. “One child was having a difficult time,” Donald Trump said of William. “It was an unfortunate thing. It worked out well, and we all get along.”But the rapprochement between the former president and his nephew collapsed with Tuesday’s publication of Fred Trump III’s book.Fred Trump III said that he hopes the book will spark a national conversation about helping families of those with disabilities, including the difficulty of caring for adult children. William is now 25 years old, lives in a group home and is doing relatively well medically, Fred Trump III said, but “we’re still struggle every day” to care for him.To this day, Donald Trump has never met William, according to Fred Trump III. He believes that is due to a view that anyone “below him” is not a worthy person “unless he needs their vote.”"
WaPo_19,U.S. swimmers are finding the podium — just not the top floor,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/30/american-swimmers-paris-olympics/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"NANTERRE, France — The Australian speedboat, Kaylee McKeown, flew into the wall, popped out of the water, found the scoreboard on the other end of the arena and then … nothing.One of the most anticipated races of the Paris swim meet, with weeks and months of buildup, and shortsighted McKeown couldn’t quite make out the numbers on the board. Was that No. 1 next to her name or Regan Smith’s? Either was feasible; the two backstrokers have traded the 100-meter world record back and forth these past five years, and the collection of women in the Olympic pool Tuesday was responsible for the top 25 times in history.McKeown’s wait would last a tad longer than everyone else’s in the building, but that certainly didn’t diminish the celebration that followed her masterful win. She turned to find a second scoreboard behind her and saw that her 57.33-second finish lowered her own Olympic record and topped second-place Smith’s time by 0.33 seconds.“I can still see splashes and things that happen around me,” McKeown explained later, after she had replaced her goggles with a pair of flashy designer glasses. “But it is a bit of a scary moment when you’re like, ‘Is that first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth?’ You never actually know.”She had successfully defended her Tokyo title and now has three Olympic gold medals in her collection. Her pool splendor had never been in question. But Tuesday’s win also helped bring focus to some broader questions that have been swirling around Paris La Défense Arena this week. The women’s 100 back was a critical race in the United States’ quest to top the Australians here. And again, the Americans repeatedly found the podium — Smith’s U.S. teammate Katharine Berkoff took bronze in the race — but not their preferred position.They’re swimming plenty fast, but the American swimmers have now gone two straight days without a gold here. They settled for second place in all three finals staged Tuesday night.“We’re always shooting for gold. That’s the American standard,” said Drew Kibler, part of the United States’ 4x200 freestyle relay team that won silver, a welcome result after finishing fourth in Tokyo. “But it’s a really special thing to be on that podium, and it was really tough a few years ago missing that podium. So it’s a step forward, but we’re always shooting for gold.”The medal count can be read in one of two ways: The United States has 15 swimming medals four days into the nine-day meet, far more than any other country. Australia is next with eight.But through 15 events, the Americans have heard their national anthem played just twice, following a first-place finish in the men’s 4x100 freestyle relay on the opening night of the meet and then again after Torri Huske’s gold in the women’s 100 butterfly. McKeown’s win Tuesday gives the Aussies four golds here.But the Americans are plenty busy, and that rivalry will see plenty more splashing. Katie Ledecky and Kate Douglass each has two more individual events on tap. Bobby Finke, too, will be a heavy favorite in the men’s 1,500 free, though he failed to defend his title Tuesday in the 800.Finke again tried his signature move — hanging back before blitzing past the leaders in a mad dash to the final wall. He sat comfortably in third for much of the race and found a new gear for the last lap. He passed Italy’s Gregorio Paltrinieri but ran out of pool and couldn’t catch Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen, who won gold with a time of 7 minutes, 38.19 seconds. Finke took second, touching the wall in 7:38.75.In the 4x200 relay, Britain’s speedy freestylers led from start to finish, winning gold with a time of 6:59.43. The American quartet of Kibler, Luke Hobson, Carson Foster and Kieran Smith finished 1.35 seconds back, taking silver in a race the Americans once dominated. Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte helped the United States win four straight gold medals (from 2004 to 2016), but Britain has won the relay in back-to-back Olympics since.Regardless of what the Americans or Aussies did, French sensation Leon Marchand again demanded the spotlight, even though he didn’t have a medal race Tuesday. Marchand swam in a pair of semifinals, capturing the top seed in the 200 butterfly and posting the second-best time in the 200 breaststroke. On Wednesday night he again will swim both — for the third time in around 32 hours — but this time with medals on the line. No swimmer has ever won gold in butterfly and breaststroke events of any length in the same Olympics.But much of the intrigue Tuesday surrounded the women’s 100 back. Smith and McKeown have been trading otherworldly marks the past few years. Smith first broke the record in 2019, then McKeown lowered it in 2021. McKeown won Olympic gold three years ago, Smith won the world title a year later, and McKeown won at worlds last year.“Regan pushes me to the best of my abilities,” McKeown said, “and I do the same for her.”At the U.S. trials last month, Smith reclaimed the world record with a time of 57.13 seconds, sending a warning shot heard around the world. McKeown said it was a motivator these past six weeks, though neither would challenge that mark in Paris.Both swimmers burst off the starting blocks Tuesday, and it was Smith who made the turn first, a hair faster than the field. McKeown was fourth, but only 0.06 seconds behind. The Aussie plowed through the final 50, covering the length of the pool in 29.25 seconds and fending off Smith down the stretch to defend her title.“We have traded world records and things like that, but she’s always good at getting it done when it matters,” Smith said. “I want to give her credit where it’s due.”Afterward the two shared a moment. Sure, they are rivals, but they’re also competitors who are continually pushing each other, redefining what’s possible in a race they both love. Fresh off their latest battle, the swimmers thanked each other.As McKeown explained, “I wouldn’t be the athlete I am if it wasn’t for her.”Dave Sheinin contributed to this report."
WaPo_20,Yorktown High School aglow over Huske’s Olympic gold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/30/torri-huske-yorktown-high-olympics/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"In Paris, swimmer Torri Huske was surrounded by family, friends and classmates from Yorktown High School, enveloped in tear-filled hugs as she won her first Olympic gold medal in the women’s 100-meter butterfly.Back in Northern Virginia, people who knew Huske — and even those who didn’t — were watching the competition with bated breath as the two-time Olympian won by 0.04 seconds.Yorktown swim coach Torey Ortmayer, who trained the 2021 graduate, watched alone at home. He said the stakes after Huske missed the podium at the Tokyo Olympics felt too high to watch with others. Natalie English, an old high school teammate, was moved to tears, knowing the victory was something Huske had been working toward for more than eight years.“She just had that sort of star power and you could tell that she had this sort of competitive edge over a lot of people, and it was just kind of this quiet confidence and this drive,” English said. “I knew the moment would come eventually, but it was so cool to see.”Seeing a high school alma mater represented in the Olympics is an exciting moment of hometown pride for communities across the country as Team USA competes. This year, in Arlington, it was Huske’s win that brought even home even more pride for those who had crossed paths with Huske at Yorktown. And for those who knew her personally, the victory was even more thrilling to know just how hard she had worked.The news of Huske’s win even reached the Costa Rican rainforest, where Matt Mendelsohn’s daughter Alexandra, who graduated from Yorktown the same year as Huske and sat next to her in biology lab, was interning, he said.“Everybody who knew somebody was being texted or called to congratulate them,” Ortmayer said in an interview. “It’s a huge moment. And I think it’s the fact that this is almost reachable for so many people, in terms of being able to say, you know, ‘I know her, I met her, or whatever.’”An Arlington native, Huske beat U.S. teammate Gretchen Walsh, the world record holder, in the final moments the race Sunday. When she popped her head out of the water and turned to the scoreboard, her mouth immediately fell open and her eyes welled up as she realized what she had just accomplished.It was a shocking comeback in her the race, and even more impressive comeback from where she fell three years earlier in Tokyo — finishing fourth and missing the medal by 0.01 seconds.“I’m not going to lie — that was devastating,” Huske told The Post Sunday night. “But I think that really fueled me. I think that did make me better.”Ortmayer recalled that moment in 2021. He was with a small group of Huske’s family and other coaches instead of the watch party that some of her friends and teammates organized at a local bar. They all knew how tense the moment would feel, and wanted something smaller.“It went from being like one of the most exciting 50 seconds of her life to one of the most like — I mean, not disappointing — but everything felt flat really quickly,” he said.Melissa Robinson, whose daughter Raquel was friends with Huske at Yorktown, printed two banners celebrating Huske’s journey to Tokyo in 2021 — one to hang at the high school, and one that all her friends signed and surprised her when she landed at the airport back home.This year, Raquel was able to break out the “Team Torri” shirts they made in 2021 to watch again this year.“To see all the sacrifices she made pay off in such a big way was just so exciting,” Robinson said.The Yorktown presence ran even deeper for Huske’s victory in Paris. Maddie Meyer, one of the photographers capturing the race for Getty images, graduated from the high school in 2010. She started photographing swim meets at Yorktown, launching her career into sports photography, capturing athletes around the world. Paris marks her fifth Olympics as a professional photographer.Meyer captured Huske at the world championships in Budapest in 2022, when she broke through and won the 100 fly and claimed five other medals. Meyer remembered first noticing Huske was an Arlington native after seeing her Arlington Aquatic Club swim cap in Tokyo. And Meyer captured Huske’s tear-filled reaction in the pool this week, a moment that made its way around the world.“The emotion on Torri’s face, which you can see in my photos and the TV coverage and everybody’s photos, is obviously how meaningful it was to her, which is just so incredible,” Meyer said. “We’re seeing some athletes be pretty stoic in their wins. It reminds me a little bit of golf. And she really had an emotive reaction, which I think also had the crowd excited for her.”Evan Stiles, head coach at Arlington Aquatic Club, said he was receiving texts and calls from so many people who recognized that this was a victory for him, too, as someone who helped Huske train for years.“There’s not that many people out there who can say they coached an Olympic gold medalist,” he said.After knowing all of the hard work that she put in behind the scenes to get there, seeing Huske win on Sunday was unbelievable for Stiles.“That race was just amazing. She finished so strong. It was surreal. It’s like this emotional explosion of every emotion you can imagine,” he said. Meyer said she wasn’t surprised to see a swimmer in the pool from Yorktown. The sometimes intense nature of Northern Virginia, where she said many students are competitive in their drive for success, often produces accomplished alumni.Ortmeyer seconded that idea.

Organizer Ross Morales Rocketto said the group submitted a complaint to X, but had no other direct communication from the platform.“We hosted the event, and it was wholesome and a bunch of dudes being earnest, getting inspired and excited,” Morales Rocketto said in an interview with The Post. “And suddenly we realized the [X] account had been suspended and we had no idea why.”Thank you all for an awesome evening. - 150,000 people have joined the cause - 190,000 people tuned in tonight- $4M+ raised to the @KamalaHarris campaign This is the start of something special and we couldn't be more proud to be in this fight with you. More to come. ✌️“White Dudes for Harris” has no affiliation with the Harris campaign, but was created to energize voters — in this case, White men — for Vice President Harris. It is part of a string of identity-focused groups, such as Black Women for Harris and White Women for Harris, that have been holding calls and fundraisers in earnest since President Biden dropped out of the race.The more than three-hour online call Monday evening featured actors Mark Hamill, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sean Astin and Josh Gad, among others who expressed their support and enthusiasm for Harris on the presidential ticket.The suspension on X, which occurred as the group and its allies were posting heavily about the event after it ended, reflects broader concerns among Democrats that the platform, which Musk bought in 2022, could be used to influence the online discourse in the months leading to the presidential election.Musk endorsed former president Donald Trump on the platform this month and has been using it to stump for the GOP candidate. The billionaire has 192 million followers on the platform, giving him a far larger social media megaphone than most any other individual — even Biden, Harris or Trump.I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery pic.twitter.com/ZdxkF63EqFMusk and X did not respond to a request for comment about the suspension of the “White Dudes for Harris” account and its reinstatement.Morales Rocketto said he and his team did not receive any communication from X or Musk about the suspension, but he felt the move was “suspicious.” A duplicate account, @dudesforharris, was created during the event, but it is unclear what role — if any — that may have played in the suspension.“I think it’s a little convenient that my [X] mentions have been full of white supremacists, saying nasty things about me and the organization,” he said. “And our account got suspended, but somehow those accounts continue to tweet at us.”This isn’t the first time an account affiliated with the Harris campaign has run into trouble with its X account.On July 21, the day Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris, numerous X users reported that they were unable to follow an official Harris campaign account, @KamalaHQ. It had previously been a Biden campaign account, but gained hundreds of thousands of followers in a matter of hours when it changed its name and handle to represent the Harris campaign.Some users who tried to follow the account that evening reported seeing a message that said: “Limit reached: You are unable to follow more people at this time.”The incident raised questions among Democratic leaders. On July 23, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) wrote an open letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, urging Jordan to join him in launching an investigation as to how and why it happened and whether Musk had a hand in the “apparent censorship” of a candidate for president.“It is my sincere hope that you channel the same outrage and pertinacity against platform censorship of the Democratic Party as you do when conservative speech is allegedly suppressed,” Nadler wrote.Musk did not respond to a request for comment on Nadler’s claims of “apparent censorship.”When Musk acquired the platform in October 2022, he pledged to make it a haven for free speech. He laid off a majority of the staff, loosened the site’s rules on hate speech, ended its policy against covid-19 misinformation and reinstated a number of previously banned accounts.This is the first presidential election cycle where Musk is in charge of the platform. Gregg Keller, a Republican strategist, said Musk has made X a “true free speech platform now,” which will be “to Trump’s substantial benefit.”Gene Kimmelman, a technology policy expert who has worked for Democratic administrations, said X has “enormous” influence over public thinking.“It’s a concern if that power is abused to benefit one political player,” Kimmelman said. “If they favor one candidate who they think will be willing to deliver benefits for them, that’s an enormous danger to our democratic system.”"
WaPo_22,Israel says it killed Hezbollah commander in Beirut suburb,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/30/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon-hezbollah/,2024-07-31 13:49:02.778514,,"BEIRUT — Israel carried out an airstrike in a densely packed neighborhood on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital Tuesday, in an attack that it said killed a senior Hezbollah commander responsible for the deaths of 12 children over the weekend in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.The strike, which threatened to escalate hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah at a combustible moment, occurred around 7:45 p.m. local time in the suburb of Haret Hreik. Lebanon’s Ministry of Health said the strike killed a woman and two children. Televised footage showed several ambulances leaving the scene of the strike, residential streets choked with smoke and debris, and a multistory building partially destroyed with several floors collapsed.In a statement, the Israeli military said the strike had killed Fuad Shukr, whom it called Hezbollah’s most “senior military commander.” Shukr, the statement said, was Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah’s “adviser for planning and directing wartime operation,” directing the group’s attacks against Israel during the war in Gaza.Hezbollah on Wednesday confirmed that Shukr was in the building but said it was still working to remove rubble so it could determine his fate. The United States previously offered a reward for information on Shukr, who it accused of playing “a central role” in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, which killed 241 U.S. military personnel.Lebanon has been bracing for war since Saturday, when a projectile hit a soccer field full of children in Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights. Israel immediately blamed Hezbollah and vowed that it would pay a “heavy price.” The United States also said Hezbollah was responsible: “It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement Sunday. Hezbollah denied it was behind the strike.On Tuesday, as the two traded fire across the border, Israel said a civilian was killed after suffering shrapnel wounds in one of Hezbollah’s rocket attacks. Hezbollah said its rocket salvos were also fired in retaliation, for civilian casualties in an Israeli raid. The Lebanese group, an ally of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, has long said it would end its attacks on Israel in the event of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.As tensions spiraled, diplomats continued to race to fend off a war. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday voiced hope that the conflict can be defused diplomatically, while also saying the United States will defend Israel if it is attacked by Hezbollah.“I don’t believe that a fight is inevitable,” Austin told reporters after meetings in Manila with senior Philippine officials alongside Secretary of State Antony Blinken to detail new security commitments for the Southeast Asian nation. “We would like to see things resolved in a diplomatic fashion.”But “if Israel is attacked, yes, we will … help Israel defend itself. We’ve been clear about that from the very beginning,” Austin said.Israel’s security cabinet authorized a military response to the weekend attack, but the specific nature of that counterstrike remained unclear, even as civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border — and the region at large — braced for it.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel “will not, and cannot, ignore this,” before vowing to retaliate: “Our response will come, and it will be severe.”But despite the threats, officials from Lebanon, the United States and even Israel had voiced a sense as recently as Tuesday that Israel’s response — while all but guaranteed — might be calibrated to prevent a larger conflagration.In an interview early Tuesday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said he expected the response to be limited. He said in an interview in his office that Lebanon had heard from “a lot of friendly countries that deal with Israel” that “there will be a response, and this response will not lead to war.”The information, he added, was provided with the understanding that it would be passed on to Hezbollah, in the expectation that the group’s response “should also not lead to war.” But in a telephone interview later Tuesday, he said he had not expected a strike on Beirut. Lebanon would go to the U.N. Security Council to ask for condemnation of that attack.“The shock is doing it in the capital,” he said, “not the action itself.”A senior U.S. official, speaking Tuesday before the strike in Beirut, said the Biden administration was pushing the Israelis for “maximal calm” and was optimistic that the Israelis would listen. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive discussions underway, said the United States believed the Israelis were not interested in escalation while acknowledging they had a right to retaliate in some way.Ideally, the official said, that would take the form of airstrikes on Hezbollah members in southern Lebanon, where Israeli attacks have been concentrated. But the killing of an Israeli civilian Tuesday had made the best-case scenario more difficult, the official said.Israeli officials signaled that they intended the Beirut attack Tuesday to be their answer to the Saturday strike.“Israel is making it clear to its friends that they want this to answer the deaths of children without leading to regional war,” said a regional diplomatic official familiar with efforts over the last two days to persuade Israel to show restraint. “The hope is Hezbollah will respond the same way.” The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.“We have finished our retaliation, and we have no intention of starting a regional war,” an Israeli official told Israel’s Channel 12 news.Lebanon’s Health Ministry said 68 civilians were injured in the attack, including five people who were in critical condition.“Hezbollah crossed the red line,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a post on X after Tuesday’s strike.The Gaza Health Ministry declared a polio epidemic Monday, more than a week after Israel’s health ministry said it had detected strains of the virus in sewage. No polio cases have yet been reported. The Gaza ministry said obtaining potable water and access to soap and disinfectants for the strip’s residents were crucial to stopping the spread of the disease. The breakdown of Gaza’s sanitation systems has also led to increases in hepatitis A, dysentery and gastroenteritis, according to Palestinian and U.N. officials.Israeli troops pulled out of eastern Khan Younis on Tuesday, ending a more than week-long incursion into the southern Gazan city that sent tens of thousands of displaced civilians fleeing. The IDF in a statement said that it “eliminated over 150 terrorists” in addition to weapons and infrastructure. Muhammad al-Mughair, an official with Gaza’s Civil Defense, told The Washington Post that emergency crews recovered the bodies of 42 people after troops withdrew, while more than 200 people remained missing. In recent weeks, Gazans packed into the strip’s southern and central regions have been repeatedly displaced by Israeli evacuation orders that now cover most of the territory, according to the United Nations.Western governments have been urging their citizens to leave Lebanon. Rena Bitter, the U.S. assistant secretary for consular affairs, urged Americans to leave before a crisis begins, while the British Foreign Office advised its citizens “against all travel to Lebanon.” Sweden, Ireland and France issued similar statements. Meanwhile, Cyprus said it is ready to receive and help repatriate civilians if tensions between Israel and Lebanon worsen. Germany and Greece’s national carriers have paused flights to Beirut for the remainder of this week.Attacks and discrimination against Muslims and Palestinians in the United States rose by 70 percent in the first half of 2024 compared with the same period from 2023, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Tuesday. The group said it received 4,951 complaints about anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian incidents regarding “immigration and asylum, employment discrimination, education discrimination and hate crimes.”At least 39,400 people have been killed and 90,996 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Birnbaum reported from Manila and Hendrix from Jerusalem.

WaPo_23,‘No flashbacks’: Simone Biles and the U.S. gymnasts win redemptive gold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/30/olympics-simone-biles-usa-gymnastics-gold/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"PARIS — The last time Simone Biles took the stage in an Olympic team final, she grimaced. She knew right then, as soon as she stalled midair during her vault, that she was not okay. She stepped off the mat with her lips pursed and a look of concern. The world’s best gymnast had been defeated, not by a competitor but because her body refused to work in sync with her mind.Biles took a break from the sport, nearly two years away, then began the comeback that led here: to the vault runway in the team final at the Paris Olympics. Biles felt calm and prepared, but only after she planted her feet on the mat after a successful 11/2 twist did she feel relieved.She smiled before she had finished controlling her landing. She knew then that this day in Paris would go as planned. This time, Biles was not the superstar who withdrew. She was the dominant force that propelled the Americans to the team gold medal by a massive margin.Jordan Chiles, who also was part of the Tokyo Olympic team, has trained alongside Biles as she has worked her way back into world-class form, and once Biles made it through Tuesday’s vault, Chiles said she thought to herself, “Yo! Hallelujah! No flashbacks.”What did it take to get here?“A lot,” said Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles. “It’s been a roller coaster for the past three years with a lot of good times and very difficult times. So today is just amazing.”The U.S. gymnasts have called this Olympics their “redemption tour,” with the team gold as their shared goal. Four of the five members of this team competed in Tokyo, and they all felt they had more they wanted to accomplish. Biles had the most high-profile letdown, but even Sunisa Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champion, left disappointed by some of the medals she didn’t win. Chiles made several mistakes on her sport’s biggest stage in 2021. And Jade Carey won gold on floor, but a stumble on the runway kept her from vying for a vault medal.After the chaos of Tokyo, Tuesday’s team final was pleasantly uneventful.After Biles endured an injury scare during Sunday’s qualifying, the anxiety over how she would perform here only heightened. But with her lower leg taped, Biles competed with her usual power and precision. Biles, who said adrenaline takes her mind away from the pain, sealed the gold medal with her floor routine in the final rotation.Biles and the U.S. team had been excellent all evening. ­Chiles’s fall on her difficult front pike salto mount onto the beam was the only blemish on an otherwise fantastic performance. With Russia banned from competing as a team in Paris, the United States had no serious challengers, and its final score of 171.296 left it nearly six points ahead of Italy, which won the silver in its best women’s gymnastics team finish since 1928. Brazil, headlined by Rebeca Andrade, won bronze, the country’s first Olympic team medal in women’s gymnastics.The U.S. women stood far above their peers, storming out to a lead that kept growing. This type of performance — not what happened in Tokyo — is the norm for the U.S. women’s gymnastics program that has been the standard-bearer in the sport for more than a decade.Since Biles made her competitive return last year, she has been fantastic. Sometimes her difficult skills generate so much buzz that they overshadow her consistency. That’s the greatness of Biles: She does the hardest skills in the world with superb execution and hardly makes major mistakes. Chiles called Biles “the greatest of all greats.”In the team final, Biles stepped out of bounds twice on floor, and she had a brief moment of unsteadiness during her beam routine. But even though she initially found herself hoping, “Please no flashbacks,” referring to the trouble in Tokyo, she stayed composed all night.Chiles and Carey both struggled during the 2023 season and failed to earn spots on the U.S. team at the world championships. Kidney-related health issues upended Lee’s training last year. But it all came together in time for Paris.They have climbed to their competitive peaks in the moments when it mattered most. The fifth gymnast, 16-year-old Hezly Rivera, did not compete. She was the only one who wasn’t part of the Tokyo squad. For the others, the value of the gold medal was rooted in their past Olympic experience.For Biles, the eighth Olympic medal made her the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history, breaking a tie with Shannon Miller. She has stood on top of the podium with the U.S. team before, but that was eight years ago.“We were a little young and naive,” said Biles, thinking back on the success she had in Rio de Janeiro as a 19-year-old. “So it didn’t hit the way that it does now.”What has changed, for Biles and the other returning Olympians, is what they’ve been through. This medal was proof of redemption."
WaPo_24,An MLB trade deadline defined by the moves that didn’t happen,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/30/mlb-trade-deadline-biggest-moves/,2024-07-31 10:00:02.778514,,"BALTIMORE — In the immediate aftermath of the chaos, the story of this year’s Major League Baseball trade deadline seemed more about the players who were not traded than those who were. After weeks and months of speculation about aces such as Detroit Tigers star Tarik Skubal or Chicago White Sox fireballer Garrett Crochet, neither moved.The prizes of this year’s market, when all was said and done, were Jack Flaherty, Yusei Kikuchi, Tanner Scott, Jason Adam and a handful of other late-game relievers who can eat the innings contenders are so desperately trying to fill. The reason for the relative lack of star power moved was, in hindsight, simple: In a year defined by injuries to front-line starters and relievers, contending teams were so in need of pitching that those who had it to sell were asking for the moon.In many cases, they got it. The Toronto Blue Jays received three big-league-ready prospects for a few weeks of Kikuchi. The Miami Marlins got three of the San Diego Padres’ top five prospects for closer Tanner Scott, and the Tampa Bay Rays got three more top ­Padres youngsters for Adam.The Baltimore Orioles had to cough up one of their better prospects, Connor Norby, alongside promising outfielder Kyle Stowers for starter Trevor Rogers, who owns a 4.53 ERA but will be under team control for two more seasons. The Orioles made several moves to bolster their roster for the stretch run, also adding starter Zach Eflin as part of their rotation remodel, trading for former Philadelphia Phillies relievers Seranthony Domínguez and Gregory Soto (in separate deals) and acquiring Eloy Jiménez from the White Sox and Austin Slater from the Cincinnati Reds to offer some right-handed-hitting outfield options after trading Austin Hays for Domínguez last week.As contending teams go, that qualified as a substantial haul. The New York Yankees added infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr., but they did not add a starter even though they needed one. They acquired late-inning relief option Mark Leiter Jr., traded away reliever Caleb Ferguson and brought in reliever Enyel De Los Santos from the Padres. The Phillies got the right-handed platoon option they needed in Hays, the closer they needed in former Angel Carlos Estévez and another reliever in Tanner Banks. The Los Angeles Dodgers stockpiled infield depth in Tommy Edman and ex-Ray Amed Rosario, along with ­Michael Kopech and Flaherty.The first-place Cleveland Guardians, meanwhile, retooled on a budget: They acquired Lane Thomas from the Washington Nationals and Alex Cobb from the San Francisco Giants in moves that cost relatively little in money and fair returns in prospects, addressing major needs in both deals. Their top American League Central competition, the Kansas City Royals, also made major improvements by acquiring relievers Hunter Harvey and Lucas ­Erceg and swingman Michael Lorenzen. The Seattle Mariners tried to fix their anemic offense by trading for Randy Arozarena — one of the biggest stars moved this week — and Justin Turner, and they added to their bullpen with Yimi García and Ryne Stanek.The biggest deal in hype and quantity was the three-team deal the Dodgers, the White Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals made that resulted in Kopech and Edman joining the Dodgers and Erick Fedde and Tommy Pham becoming Cardinals. The Rays and Marlins orchestrated large-scale sell-offs that netted them multiple top prospects. The Blue Jays, who chose to sell only expiring contracts rather than tear things down completely in the midst of a disappointing season, dealt Kevin Kiermaier to the Dodgers, Trevor Richards to the Minnesota Twins, Isiah Kiner-Falefa to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Turner and García to the Mariners, Nate Pearson to the Chicago Cubs and Danny Jansen to the Boston Red Sox in moves that will help bolster their depth ahead of another attempt to contend in 2025.But in sum, the star power exchanged at the deadline was limited, particularly compared with years past. There was no Juan Soto deal seizing the spotlight, no future Hall of Famers such as Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander on offer. On the flip side, no prospects ranked in Baseball America’s top 100 were dealt, the first time that has happened since at least 2014.As has been true since MLB expanded its postseason to 12 teams in 2022, more teams in reach of playoff spots meant fewer true sellers, and fewer true sellers meant fewer opportunities for buyers to pry stars away from their current teams. It showed.Now, any additions that teams need to help them get to and get through October will have to come from inside the organization. Few contenders will be selling out jerseys for new big-name stars. This deadline was defined more by moves made to plug weaknesses, not suddenly establish new strengths.Perhaps, in time, a contender will prove that this deadline changed its fate dramatically. But the whole event might best be summarized by the fact that, as of 6:01 p.m. Tuesday, exactly who that team might be simply was not clear."
WaPo_25,More than 900 Native American children died at U.S. boarding schools,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/30/indian-boarding-schools-native-americans/,2024-07-31 09:00:02.778514,,"More than 900 Native American children died while being forced to attend Indian boarding schools, according to a new federal report that urges the U.S. government to formally apologize for the enduring trauma inflicted by its systematic effort to assimilate the children and destroy their culture.Many of the children were buried in at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites at 65 former schools across the country, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior report released Tuesday. The actual number of children who died and the number of potential burial sites are probably greater, the report said.“For the first time in the history of the country, the U.S. Government is accounting for its role in operating Indian boarding schools to forcibly assimilate Indian children, and working to set us on a path to heal from the wounds inflicted by those schools,” wrote Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland in a letter presenting the report to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary.The report is the second and final by the department examining 417 federal boarding schools that operated from 1819 to 1969 across 37 states. It built on the department’s May 2022 report to further document the scope and impact of Indian boarding schools in the United States, and it makes recommendations for the federal government to reconcile the traumatic legacy.In the new report, Newland’s team of researchers said they identified 18,624 Native American children who were forced to attend the schools, but noted that the number of students was greater. The report also estimated that the federal government spent more than $23.3 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars over 98 years to implement the Indian boarding school system, similar institutions and associated assimilation policies.In 2021, Haaland — who is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe of New Mexico and whose own relatives were sent to boarding schools — launched an investigation into the network of U.S. boarding schools after the discovery of suspected unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in Canada. In the United States, generations of Native American children were taken from their families and sent to boarding schools hundreds of miles away to be assimilated into White society. Children were stripped of their names and instead often assigned numbers, their long hair was cut, and they were beaten for speaking their languages, leaving deep emotional scars on Native American families and communities. By 1900, 1 out of 5 Native American school-age children attended a boarding school.The Washington Post, in a year-long investigation published in May, found at least 122 priests, sisters and brothers assigned to 22 boarding schools since the 1890s were later accused of sexually abusing Native American children under their care. Most of the documented abuse occurred in the 1950s and 1960s and involved more than 1,000 children.
About two weeks later, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a formal apology for the church’s role in inflicting a “history of trauma” on Native Americans. The document said, “We all must do our part to increase awareness and break the culture of silence that surrounds all types of afflictions and past mistreatment and neglect.”The Interior report noted the Catholic Bishops’ apology but said there is no indication that the bishops support the idea that Pope Francis apologize to Native Americans in the United States for the abuse and mistreatment of children at boarding schools, as he did in Canada. The pope traveled to Canada in 2022 and apologized for the church’s role there in the “cultural destruction and forced assimilation promoted by the governments of that time.”The pope has remained silent about the abuse at Catholic-run Indian boarding schools in the United States. About half of the 417 federal Indian boarding schools were operated by a religious institution or organization, according to the report. At least 80 of the schools were operated by the Catholic Church or its affiliates. On a call Tuesday, Haaland told reporters that “it would be a really wonderful gesture” if the pope apologized to Native Americans in the United States.The government, the report said, should acknowledge its role in running the Indian boarding school system in which many Native American children were physically, sexually and emotionally abused and hundreds died. The report also called for the U.S. government to issue an apology to the individuals, families and Indian tribes that were harmed by the 150-year boarding school policy.In the spring, Deborah Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes and the chief executive of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, met at the White House with Tom Perez, a senior adviser and assistant to President Biden, and asked for a presidential apology for the widespread mistreatment and abuse that Native American children suffered at boarding schools. Parker’s group has documented more than 100 former boarding schools in addition to the 417 identified by the federal government, most of them run by religious groups and churches.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the new report or its push for an apology.The report documented 973 deaths, including 189 children who died at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, the first federal Indian boarding school located off a reservation and established in 1879 in Pennsylvania.Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community (Ojibwe), said in the call with reporters that the Interior Department was unable to identify the names of many children who died, nor the reasons for their deaths. But he said many died amid outbreaks of disease. For other children, “it’s very likely that many of those kids died of abuse or the aftereffects of the abuse,” Newland said.Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said the Interior Department’s revelation that 136 children from his tribe died while at boarding schools served as a haunting reminder of the generational damage done to tribal languages and culture.“Those are grandmas and grandpas that never came home,” said Nygren, whose grandmother was taken from her home on the Navajo reservation and sent nearly 700 miles away to Sherman Institute, an Indian boarding school in Riverside, Calif. “They were deported from their reservations to try to take the Indian, to try to take the Navajo, out of them. The government took these kids and they never returned to their families. It’s just devastating and it ruined 136 families.”Haaland’s three-year investigation cost $21 million and involved a review of about 103 million pages of U.S. government records at the American Indian Records Repository in Lenexa, Kan., and nine National Archives and Records Administration facilities across the country.But the department said some records are no longer available. Some schools burned down and those records may have been destroyed.The report’s recommendations included that the federal government should consider returning some former boarding school sites to tribes.The historical trauma of federal Indian boarding schools and other assimilation-related policies “often impacted several generations” and continues to fuel high suicide rates, drug abuse, alcoholism, and poor parenting among Native Americans and their communities, the report said, citing several studies.“The federal government — facilitated by the Department I lead — took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,” Haaland said in a statement.After their first report in 2022, Haaland and Newland spent more than a year traveling from Oklahoma to Alaska on what was called “The Road to Healing” tour. At 12 stops, for up to eight hours a day, they listened to stories of emotional, physical and sexual abuse told by survivors and their descendants.In this final report, Newland included some of the harrowing descriptions by survivors. One former student from Wrangell in Alaska said the school “was a place that attracted pedophiles and many matrons, men and women, perpetrated themselves upon little boys and girls. And what I witnessed in the boys dorm were where matrons were sodomizing boys in their beds or in the bathrooms. We saw girls going home in the middle of the school year pregnant and a lot of these children were like 11 and 12, 13 years old.”A survivor from a school in South Dakota said: “The sad part about it is a lot of us had to watch the priest sodomize our — so, had to watch our classmates become sexually assaulted. So that’s — nobody wants to share things like that. I’ve learned how to be tough because you couldn’t cry. Couldn’t do that.”In Michigan, a boarding school survivor recalled the chilling sound of children crying.“I think the worst part of it was at night, listening to all the other children crying themselves to sleep, crying for their parents, and just wanting to go home,” the survivor said. “And I remember one girl was a bedwetter, and they made her scrub the entire bathroom on her hands and knees with her toothbrush.”And in Alaska, another survivor spoke of the planes coming to take the children and send them hundreds of miles away.“I would like to say my aunt said after we all left, after the planes came and we all left, she said the village was so quiet because there was no children. No children in the village.”"

The dead include one soldier, the defense ministry said.Jorge Rodríguez, president of the Maduro-controlled national assembly and brother of Maduro’s vice president, blamed Machado and González for the violence and demanded their arrests. The government, he said, doesn’t negotiate with “fascists.”Earlier Tuesday, masked men in black forced opposition leader Freddy Superlano and two members of his team into a vehicle in Caracas and drove them away.The attacks and threats are an escalation for Maduro, who claims to have won reelection Sunday despite exit polls and, the opposition says, the government’s own records that show González won twice as many votes.While protesters across Venezuela and leaders throughout the world demand he prove he won, he is doubling down against opponents.“There is clearly an absolute and total determination to not respect the popular will of the people through their vote, and to never respect peaceful protest in the streets,” said Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal. “It sends a clear signal of authoritarianism that has always existed but is increasing.”Late Monday, opposition leaders uploaded printouts of voting center records compiled by thousands of citizen poll watchers, which they said proved González’s victory.“We will defend every vote, and we will make sure the regime recognizes what the whole world knows,” Machado told a sea of people outside the U.N. mission in Caracas: “Edmundo is our next president.”González addressed himself to the armed forces: “There is no reason to repress the people of Venezuela.”“We insist that you respect the will of the people” as expressed in the election and “stop the repression of peaceful protests,” he said in a message on X. “You know what happened on Sunday … The truth is the way to peace.”Thousands of Venezuelans descended on the capital, on motorbikes and by foot, many from working-class neighborhoods that once supported Maduro and his mentor, Hugo Chávez, the founder of the socialist state.Some carried receipts. As González and Machado addressed the crowd, a man approached waving a long ribbon of paper — one of tens of thousands of voting records that together, the opposition says, show González won.“We have proof!” the man shouted.Maduro, speaking to supporters at the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, taunted González.“Come after me. I’ll be waiting for you in Miraflores,” he said. “Come after me, coward.”The United States rejected calls for the opposition leaders’ arrests.“Venezuelans have the constitutional right to express their views freely & without reprisal,” Brian A. Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, wrote on X. “Actions to detain or arrest members of the democratic opposition show that lacking any evidence to back Maduro’s electoral claims, he resorts to repression.”The claim by Maduro’s electoral council that he won was contradicted by at least two independent sources.A Caracas-based group that obtained official results from a random sample of 971 voting centers across the country estimated González received 66 percent of the vote to Maduro’s 31 percent.New Jersey-based Edison Research, which interviewed 6,846 voters as they left 100 voting locations on Sunday, recorded 65 percent for González and 31 percent or Maduro.Pollsters consider nearly identical results produced by two different methodologies strong evidence of accuracy.The opposition, which has gathered what it says are more than 80 percent of the voting records Sunday, says they show González won with 67 percent to Maduro’s 31 percent.The United States and several Latin American countries have said the government should release the records that prove Maduro won. They include Colombia and Brazil, neighboring countries with leftist leaders who have had friendly relations with Maduro.“It is normal that there is a dispute,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a lion of the Latin American left, told Globo TV on Tuesday. “How do you resolve this dispute? Presenting the voting records.”“If there’s any doubt between the opposition and the government, the opposition files a complaint and will wait for the courts to make a decision, which we’ll have to accept. I’m convinced it’s a normal, peaceful process.”Venezuelan allies Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and Syria have expressed support for Maduro, as have Latin American friends Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras.In the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a caravan of hundreds of motorcycles was intercepted by the National Guard, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets at them.Rafael Gutierrez, a 30-year-old mechanic from Petare, one of Venezuela’s largest slums, said the caravan was “protesting peacefully” until the National Guard arrived.“We all saw how he cheated us,” Gutierrez said. “We don’t want a bloodbath. We have family and friends all supporting our cause. Now it’s in the hands of God.”Outside the U.N. mission, protesters waiting for González and Machado waved red, yellow and blue signs and sang the national anthem. A banner advised: “Let’s go with the truth and without violence.”“You can see it, you can feel it, Edmundo is president” they chanted — in Spanish, it rhymes — and the word that has echoed across the capital for the past two days: “Libertad!” “Freedom!”Among the thousands waiting under the tropical midday sun was a group of women in their 60s who served as poll watchers on Sunday. Some stayed at their voting centers from 4 a.m. until past midnight to monitor the vote and collect the voting records.“We’re on our way out of this,” said Virginia Castro Saporiti, 61. “Maduro has the power, but María Corina has the authority. … This will fall, with national and international pressure, and the strength of an entire country that wants change.“We know the hours and days ahead will be difficult, but we’ll keep going until the end.”On Monday, crowds marched to Miraflores, tying up traffic, banging pots and pans and demanding the end of the socialist state. Across the country, protesters burned billboards of Maduro and destroyed statues of Chávez.At least 177 people were detained, Foro Penal said.Forty-eight soldiers and police officers were wounded, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López said, in what he called “violent actions promoted by the Venezuelan extreme right” during a “media coup d’état” supported by “North American imperialism.”The apparently spontaneous demonstrations appeared to stand apart from the several waves of civil unrest aimed at the Venezuelan government over the years in that they included former supporters of Chavez, Maduro and their movement, called chavismo.“The whole mountain is coming down. Nobody wants it anymore,” said Deivis Limis, 40.He said he had walked along a highway on Monday for more than four hours from his neighborhood of Caucaguita to join crowds in the capital.“We aren’t protesting, we’re asking for our votes. He lost a clear loss. He has to leave,” Limis said. “We can’t continue in this yoke that he has on us.”In Petare, where large protests broke out Monday, the streets were empty Tuesday, and most businesses were closed.A group of around 50 heavily armed men dressed in black with their faces masked were guarding the exits.In the 23 de Enero neighborhood, colectivos — Maduro-supporting bikers — prevented residents from attending the rally outside the U.N. mission, according to a resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.Maduro ordered security forces to quell the protests in a “maximum mobilization.”“We’ve seen this movie before,” he said in televised remarks Monday. “We know how to face these situations and how to ­defeat the violent ones.”Maduro is under investigation by the International Criminal Court, the first investigation of its kind in Latin America, into claims that his security forces participated in the torture and extrajudicial killings of dissidents during street uprisings against him in 2017.Scott Clement in Washington and Marina Dias in Brasília contributed to this report."
WaPo_27,Olympic triathlons begin with a long-awaited splash into the Seine,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/paris-olympics-triathlon-seine-pollution/,2024-07-31 15:35:02.652759,,"PARIS – At 20 seconds past 8 a.m. here Wednesday, 55 female triathletes plunged into the Seine just below the Pont Alexandre III. The splash they made could barely be heard over the cheers of fans gathered in bleachers along the riverbank and on the streets several feet away. But it was a massive leap for a city that longed to use the Paris Olympics to make the river safe for swimming again.For nearly 100 years, the Seine has been considered unsafe for swimming because of massive pollution, and political leaders from Paris and surrounding municipalities have spent 1.4 billion euros on a sprawling cleanup project that was supposed to be finished in time for Olympic triathlons and marathon swimming events.But after Paris 2024 and city leaders boasted about weeks of low E. Coli readings in the river, a weekend rainstorm pushed those numbers to unsafe levels, leading to the cancellation of two river training sessions and the postponement of Tuesday’s men’s triathlon. The setbacks fueled worries that Paris’s grand ambitions for the Seine were unrealistic, and that the triathlons might have to be turned into run-bike duathlons.Just after midnight local time on Wednesday, a large rainstorm moved over the city, lingering until sunrise. Rain pattered against windows and rattled off rooftops, sending streams of water across sidewalks and cobblestone streets and into gutters. Because Paris has an old sewer system, rainwater runoff goes into the same pipes as sewer water, often overwhelming the sewers and sending waste into the Seine. This is what happened over the weened when almost an inch of rain fell over two days, organizers said this week.Still, when leaders from Paris 2024, World Triathlon, the city of Paris and other French municipalities and agencies met at 3:30 a.m. here Wednesday they decided to go ahead with the women’s triathlon, which had always been scheduled for 8 a.m., and the men’s, which was moved to 10:45 a.m. World Triathlon uses tests of water samples from 24 hours before a race to decide if a race is safe to run, meaning they were studying samples from before Wednesday’s rain.The mood around the bridge, one of Paris’s most spectacular, with towering gold statues of winged horses on each end, was festive as the start approached. Fans gathered on either side of the river, some filling bleachers left over from last Friday’s opening ceremony. Not long before 8 a.m, the rain stopped and the clouds above the nearby Eiffel Tower broke apart, revealing hints of blue sky.The crowds cheered as the triathletes ran across the bridge from their warm-up area on the river’s right bank to a stone staircase on the edge of the left bank, where they lined up on a pontoon for the race’s start. Helicopters hovered overhead. A few air horns screeched and cowbells rang. Photographers leaned against the bridge’s stone railings to capture the moment the athletes jumped into the Seine.There was silence. And then splash.This is a developing story and will be updated."
WaPo_28,Some dark chocolates contain heavy metals. Should you be concerned?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/dark-chocolate-heavy-metals-study/,2024-07-31 15:00:02.652759,,"An eight-year study conducted by researchers at George Washington University and ConsumerLab, a company that tests and evaluates health foods and supplements, found certain dark chocolates and cocoa products contain amounts of lead and cadmium that are above California’s strict regulations on the heavy metals.“The amount of lead that was found, in general, was not alarming,” said Leigh Frame, the co-lead author of the study and the executive director of the office of integrative medicine and health at George Washington University. “But most people probably don’t have a great handle on what their heavy metal exposure is.”The study’s findings are not a reason to stop eating dark chocolate, Frame said. Some studies suggest flavonoids found in dark chocolate may lower the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.But these small exposures to heavy metals, plus other exposures in an individual’s diet, could amount to higher blood lead levels over time. “And that is something that we all need to be aware of,” Frame said.“I would not want someone to be afraid of chocolate. That would be the worst thing that could come out of the study to me,” she said. “Frankly, it’s a small contributor to our diet.”The study was published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition on Wednesday.Hands is a contract researcher for Consumer Labs.The George Washington University study follows the findings of a 2022 investigation by Consumer Reports that detected cadmium and lead in all of the 28 dark chocolate bars tested, as well as follow-up testing of 48 cocoa-containing products in 2023.In response to questions about the GWU study, an FDA spokesperson said, “while the presence of cadmium and lead in chocolate has been the subject of considerable media attention, experts from around the world have found that chocolate is a minor source of exposure to these contaminants internationally.”Chocolate, or cocoa, has been historically used as a medicine to treat fatigue and improve digestion. And studies suggest flavonoids found in cocoa can lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. But the type of chocolate matters; darker chocolate often contains higher amounts of cocoa and more flavonoids.Chronic exposure to lead and cadmium is associated with kidney dysfunction and other health problems. Infants, young children and pregnant people can be particularly vulnerable because prolonged lead exposure in early development has been associated with a higher risk of learning disabilities or lower IQ levels.Young children in the United States are eating and drinking far less lead than they did decades ago — from 43 micrograms per day in 1980, to around 1 microgram per day in 2016 — according to the FDA.However, lead contamination in food products remains a concern. In the fall, the FDA warned of “extremely high” levels of lead detected in three brand names of cinnamon applesauce puree pouches. And the agency continues to send public health alerts recommending that consumers stop using and dispose of certain ground cinnamon products contaminated with lead.Frame said the good news is kids generally don’t like eating dark chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the more the cocoa powder and the potential for higher amounts of lead, cadmium or other metals.“I don’t think we need to worry as much about kids,” Frame said.And cocoa powders — such as mixes used for hot chocolate — are often more akin to milk chocolate with less raw cocoa than dark chocolate, she said.Christopher Gindlesperger, the senior vice president of public affairs and communications for the National Confectioners Association, the trade organization for the candy industry in the United States, said chocolate and cocoa are safe to eat, and food safety and product quality “remain our highest priorities.”“Consumers understand that chocolate and candy are occasional treats and not center-of-the-plate foods,” Gindlesperger wrote in an email.Cadmium in the soil can transfer into a cacoa tree growing there, leading to a “natural contamination,” said Tewodros Godebo, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.Lead, though, appears to be introduced during the production of cocoa products, not from the soil, but potentially during drying, processing or packaging, Godebo said.Katarzyna Kordas, an associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at University of Buffalo, said in an email that the study’s findings demonstrate “not all chocolate or cocoa products are created equal.” Some contain more metal than others.The amount of a metal someone is exposed to is a function of how much of the contaminant is in the food, how much the person consumes and whether they’re eating on an empty or full stomach, Kordas said. “We tend to absorb proportionally more metals on an empty stomach,” she said.But the amount of lead or cadmium detected in the study is often below stringent reference values and that suggests “the level of concern may be low,” Kordas said.Godebo said California’s regulations on heavy metals are “very conservative,” making it difficult to translate what the amounts of cadmium or lead mean for the general population. People are exposed to metals every day, and other types of foods, vegetables and fruits can be more significant sources of heavy metals, he said.“Of course, we want a negligible amount of exposure,” Godebo said. “But, literally, it’s impossible.”In a study published in June, Godebo and other researchers at Tulane University tested 155 dark and milk chocolates for lead and other heavy metals and concluded eating one ounce of dark chocolate a day “poses no health concerns for adults.” The researchers also determined four of the chocolate bars tested had cadmium levels that could pose a risk to young children.“What we’ve found is that it’s quite safe to consume dark and milk chocolates,” Godebo said in a statement in June about the study.Frame said she continues to eat chocolate.People can eat a diverse diet of different foods to reduce any potential exposure to lead, or other heavy metals, from a part of their diet, Frame said.Anyone concerned about their exposure to lead, cadmium or other metals should ask their physician for a blood test, Frame said. “Then you’ll have a ground truth,” to determine whether relatively small exposures in your diet could be adding up to higher blood lead levels.“I think it’s pretty clear, actually, that having one ounce of chocolate a day is not detrimental,” Frame said. But people can be cognizant of how much they’re having and how often, she said.Frame said she eats chocolate every other day.“It makes it feel more like a treat,” she said."
WaPo_29,What’s in Kamala Harris’s laugh?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/31/kamala-harris-laugh/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"Vice President Harris laughs at 128 beats per minute — the same tempo as some truly excellent dance songs, such as “We Found Love” by Rihanna or Kylie Minogue’s “Padam Padam.” Which is why, after an unprecedented wave of viral content in support of Harris’s candidacy took over social media last week, music producer Leo Zarucky sat in his Melbourne, Australia, studio and recorded a remix.It started with her now-famous “coconut tree” quote, interjected with her ebullient laugh. He dropped the beat. Each “ha” punctuated a thumping bass line that could get people out onto the floor in any club.It’s “such a rhythmic-sounding laugh,” he says. “When I found the right BPM, it was actually, like, pretty much in time. I didn’t need to alter it.”Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, comedian Allison Reese stood before a fake White House backdrop in a blazer, wig and pearls, and let out an impression of the candidate’s distinctive peal of laughter. As a Harris impressionist on TikTok, Reese has probably spent more time thinking about that laugh than the candidate herself. It’s a little higher in the throat, but not breathy. There’s a cadence to it. It’s melodic, but within a tight range of notes.“It’s like she’s surprised at the laugh,” Reese says. “It feels more uninhibited. … The laugh is truly coming from this place of inner joy.”Harris’s laugh has become one of the candidate’s most defining and most dissected personal traits, for better or for worse. Social media crowned her the de facto queen of IJBOL — “I just burst out laughing,” a descendant of LOL (laugh out loud) and ROFL (rolling on the floor laughing). Her chuckles are all over the internet: At first, in conservative-produced supercuts of her laughing repeatedly, meant to paint her as wacky or unhinged. But those have been superseded by flattering fan videos adding her laugh to pop songs, emphasizing it as a thing to be celebrated, a trait that makes the candidate warm and human and, well, funny.Forget choosing a candidate based on whether you can have a beer with them, a trope often expressed during the 2000 election cycle.“She seems like a politician I could sit down and have a laugh with,” Reese says. “That’s something I want in somebody leading our country: Somebody who embraces their humanity.”But before we talk about any of that, we need to talk about why everyone’s talking about her laugh. And why they aren’t overanalyzing and meme-ing the laughs of any of the male politicians running for office this cycle.You can probably guess why.“It’s been taboo for women to speak too loud, to laugh too loud, to laugh too much,” says Kathleen Karlyn, a scholar of cinema and media studies. “It’s predictable that, when Kamala laughs, she’s asserting her power and her refusal to be silent or play by these old rules about proper femininity.”The laugh of a would-be woman president always raises the hackles of those who seek to knock her down. Hillary Clinton’s wide-mouthed, whole-body howls became known as the Clinton Cackle when she first ran for president in 2007. It erupted at confusing moments: during an exchange about Iran on the debate stage, and when she was asked about her health-care plan on the Sunday morning talk shows. Critics called it calculated; advisers explained that it was a way to respond without seeming guarded or sharp.“You guys keep telling me, lighten up, be fun,” Clinton told reporters on the trail with her in Iowa in January 2007. “Now I get a little funny, and I’m being psychoanalyzed.”“It’s how women have been sullied — how women have been demeaned as leaders in our society,” says Donna Brazile, the veteran political strategist who has previously led the Democratic National Committee.It has been 17 years, but the playbook remains the same. Harris’s Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, floated a new nickname for the vice president — “Laughing Kamala” — at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., earlier this month. “You ever watch her laugh?” Trump said. “ … You can tell a lot by a laugh. No — she’s crazy. She’s nuts.” Fox News personality Sean Hannity suggested this month that Harris’s laugh was a reason “voters seem to detest” her. The network played a supercut of Harris laughing alongside the chyron “Kamala’s awkward laugh turns off voters.” A memo of Harris’s negatives from the GOP’s Senate campaign committee noted — in a section titled “Weird” — that “Kamala Harris has a habit of laughing at inappropriate moments.”National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Mike Berg thinks the attacks are working, though he offered no data to back up the assertion. “You don’t need a poll to know that it turns off voters when Kamala Harris laughs at voter concerns,” he says.“I have recommended that we ignore it as much as possible,” Brazile says of the laugh discourse. “Let the historians and the political scientists and the scholars talk about the treatment of women throughout our history.” Even the good vibes? “If people in the movement want to celebrate, then fine,” she says.Why aren’t people talking about Trump laughing? Maybe it’s sexism. Or maybe because he doesn’t.“I find it interesting that her laugh is more of a topic and subject other than his lack of emotion,” says Reese, the Harris impressionist. “I’ve never seen him laugh. Not even, like, polite chuckles.”(Here, Reese proceeds to do an impression of what she imagines Trump’s laugh sounds like, which is similar to the noises made by Jurassic Park velociraptors.)Trump’s lack of laughter sets him apart from most of his Oval Office predecessors. Bill Clinton guffawed. George W. Bush snickered. Barack Obama had a habit of cracking himself up with his own punchlines. President Biden, before his face turned rigid, flashed a sparkling grin with his soft chuckle. Trump, on the rare occasion that he registers humor, opts for a single, wide-mouthed “Ha!” (Like he did during the 2016 campaign, when someone, in response to his question about whether an animal in the crowd was a dog, shouted back, “It’s Hillary!”)her laugh her laugh  #kamalaharris #kamala #coconuttree #kamalacoconutspeech #kamalaedit #houseremix #musicproducer #coconut #politicalmemes Mary L. Trump, his niece and an outspoken critic of his, speculated that it’s a family trait. Her grandfather, Donald’s father, didn’t laugh, either. “Laughing is to make yourself vulnerable, it’s to let down your guard in some way, it’s to lose a little bit of control,” she told Slate in 2020.Conservatives seem to have lost control of the “Laughing Kamala” narrative that they tried to create. What they put forth as cringeworthy has been alchemized into coconutmentum. Whether you like it or not is in the ear of the beholder.The use of the laugh in music has produced “a really interesting artistic and political ecosystem,” says Justin Patch, an associate professor at Vassar College who studies music in American politics. “Anybody can use it. If you love Kamala Harris, you can clip that laugh to do things that make her seem cool. If you hate Kamala Harris, you can clip that laugh and make her seem like Cruella de Vil.”Or, if you’re Zarucky — an Australian who notes that he has no stake in the outcome of the U.S. election and did it “purely for the memes, for the laughs” — you can leave it up to the listeners to decide. He’s been watching the fans and haters duke it out in the comments.“People will take it whatever way they want to,” he says.Our responses to laughter say a lot more about us than about the person laughing, says Adrienne Wood, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. To those inclined to like Harris — namely, Democrats ready to elect her as president — her laughter is rewarding and builds an affinity between her and her fans. For those who are disinclined, they’re going to find her double-over cackles supremely annoying. “There’s always this feeling about others enjoying themselves when you don’t like them,” she says.Wood compares it to what happens when a group of close friends goes out to dinner — after a few bottles of wine have been poured and everyone’s telling old stories. “If you’re at that dinner table, it’s going to feel amazing,” Wood says. “If you’re at the table over and there’s a group of people laughing their heads off, you’re going to feel a different way about it.”And Harris’s particular laugh could be especially triggering to critics, Wood adds. “People in a position of status and power have a disinhibited laugh — they laugh more, bigger, louder,” Wood says. “Part of the reason why people have a negative reaction to her is that she has the status to take up space, to be disinhibited.”Disgust is a powerful political mechanism, says Kate Manne, a philosopher at Cornell University. She wrote in her 2017 book about how conservatives weaponized Hillary Clinton’s laugh during the 2016 campaign, transforming mild pangs of ick into harsh criticisms of her morality. But “voters are savvier this time around,” Manne says. Less than two weeks into Harris’s candidacy, “we’ve seen misogyny, racism, but we’re also seeing people being smarter than they were in 2016.”Harris seems to be in on the joke, too, owning her outbursts as a proud part of her origin story. “Let me just tell you something: I have my mother’s laugh,” Harris told Drew Barrymore on the actress’s talk show in spring. “And I grew up around a bunch of women, in particular, who laughed from the belly. They laughed. They would sit around the kitchen and drinking their coffee, telling big stories with big laughs.”“You know I’m never going to be — ” Harris paused and impersonated a pearl-clutching giggle — “I’m just not that person.”Laughter, scientists and sociologists have found, is an incredibly complex and deft communicator. In studying Harris’s, Reese believes it is an “energetic release.” It’s “not like ‘I’m laughing at’” something. “It’s like an ‘I’m enjoying this moment’ kind of a thing.”And there’s a reason people are hearing music in her voice: It’s a melodic laugh, and the “coconut tree” laugh has a syncopated beat. Zarucky’s music production software identified a common note in her laugh to be a B-flat.That means Harris’s natural laugh tone also matches the kind of music she likes to listen to. In her frequent stops at record stores over the years, Harris has been spotted buying records by Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Ella Fitzgerald.“The jazz repertoire,” says Patch, the musicologist. “You’ll find a lot of B-flats in there.”"
WaPo_30,Biden kicks sweeping student debt relief plan into gear,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/31/biden-student-debt-relief/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"The Education Department on Wednesday will begin emailing millions of student loan borrowers to let them opt out of President Biden’s new policy to reduce or eliminate their balances, advancing an alternative plan to the program struck down by the Supreme Court last year.Biden’s debt relief policies are sure to take center stage as the election nears, despite the president’s departure from the campaign. Vice President Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, has heralded the administration’s efforts to clear the ledgers for millions of borrowers and said she would continue the policies if elected. While that position will curry favor with liberals who praise Biden for canceling more than $168 billion in student debt, it could further fuel political opposition from conservatives who consider the policies fiscally irresponsible.Although the newest loan forgiveness plan will be finalized in the fall, the Biden administration is getting a jump on the process by informing borrowers that they have until Aug. 30 to call their loan servicer to bow out. Those who are interested in receiving relief need not take any action. Those who opt-out will not be able to opt back in, according to the Education Department. Borrowers are only eligible for the proposed relief if they have entered repayment after the proposed rules are finalized.“By providing more information to borrowers on how they can take advantage of our upcoming debt relief programs, borrowers will be prepared to benefit swiftly once the rules are final,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday. “Despite attempts led by Republican elected officials to block our efforts, we won’t stop fighting to provide relief to student loan borrowers, fix the broken student loan system, and help borrowers get out from under the burden of student debt.”Since the Supreme Court blocked Biden’s plan to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loans per borrower in 2023, the Education Department has worked through a negotiated rulemaking process to create a regulation that achieves large-scale debt cancellation, albeit with a much more targeted approach than the last plan. The proposed plan is designed to reach people who are shut out of existing programs and those who have been trapped in unaffordable debt because of the byzantine student loan system, according to the department.The proposed plan provides partial or full debt relief to borrowers in four circumstances: those who owe far more than they originally borrowed because of interest; those who have been paying for at least 20 or 25 years; those who attended career training programs that led to high debt loads or low earnings; and those who are eligible for existing forgiveness programs but never applied.A key feature is the planned elimination of up to $20,000 in accrued interest for borrowers, regardless of their income. Single borrowers earning less than $120,000 or married couples earning less than $240,000 could qualify to have all of their accrued interest forgiven if they are enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan. The White House estimates more than 25 million people could benefit from that component alone. It will take effect this fall when the proposal is finalized, while other features will debut next year.The new plan relies on the authority of the Higher Education Act — a different law than the one the administration cited in its failed 2022 plan — which experts say could give it firmer legal ground. But much like the last plan, Biden’s latest bid for sweeping debt relief could face legal challenges from conservatives.“This is just another illegal scheme intended to buy votes in November, and it will do nothing to address the student loan disaster that Biden-Harris has exacerbated,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Education Committee. “Overpromising and underdelivering is an undeniable hallmark of this administration.”"
WaPo_31,D.C. attorney general sues StubHub over ticket-buying process and fees,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/31/stubhub-lawsuit-dc-attorney-general/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"The D.C. attorney general is suing online ticket provider StubHub for allegedly adding surprise fees onto a needlessly long checkout process in violation of local consumer protection laws.The lawsuit, to be filed Wednesday in D.C. Superior Court, alleges that StubHub deceives customers by offering them an incomplete price at first, then making them go through a purchase process that can involve more than 12 pages — with a timer to impart a sense of urgency — and adding extra fees.The “true price” of the ticket is obscured in a way that deceives customers and prevents comparison-shopping, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb (D) said in a statement.“This is no accident — StubHub intentionally hides the true price to boost profits at its customers’ expense,” Schwalb said in a statement Wednesday.The lawsuit ramps up scrutiny of a prominent ticket-seller in a city where live events generate considerable revenue for venues and ticket promoters.Schwalb is seeking an injunction along with unspecified civil penalties and a return of the money it gained through the allegedly unlawful practices. He estimates that StubHub alone has sold nearly 5 million tickets in D.C., getting an estimated $118 million from extra fees since 2015.StubHub has faced legal scrutiny of its fees before. A class-action lawsuit filed 2019 in San Francisco also alleged a bait-and-switch in the way fees are displayed. StubHub denied the allegations but settled the litigation.The concept of “drip pricing” — a term Schwalb’s office used to describe StubHub’s practices — has come up in other D.C. lawsuits.In 2019 then-Attorney General Karl A. Racine sued Marriott for allegedly hiding the true price of hotel rooms by adding “resort fees” or “amenity fees” after a room is booked, ultimately charging the customer more than what was advertised. The lawsuit is ongoing.In July, the Washington Nationals were sued by the National Consumers League, a nonprofit advocacy group, over per-ticket fees that the group said weren’t described up front.Schwalb said the lawsuit is part of his office’s efforts to rid D.C.’s live entertainment scene of deceptive practices.“The District is home to one of the nation’s largest and most vibrant live entertainment scenes, and StubHub’s predatory tactics disproportionately harm District residents,” Schwalb said."
WaPo_32,Bloomberg-backed gun regulation group pledges $45 million for election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/bloomberg-everytown-gun-safety-election/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"The political arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun regulation group founded by former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, plans to spend $45 million over the coming months to elect favored candidates in eight of the states that could determine control of the White House, House, Senate and local offices.The effort will include a new student organizing drive, with plans to hire 30 new organizers for volunteer recruitment drives at 32 college and university campuses in Arizona, California, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The group’s leaders said the effort will focus on younger voters, voters of color and suburban women, with new field offices in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan.“With MAGA Republicans pushing an extreme ‘guns everywhere’ agenda, this election is a life-or-death moment — so Everytown is going all-out to mobilize the majority of Americans who want to live free from the fear of gun violence,” Everytown for Gun Safety president John Feinblatt said in a statement. “From sending Vice President Harris to the Oval Office to helping our own volunteers win office, we’ll elect gun sense champions up and down the ballot.”The group — along with its grassroots networks, Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action — endorsed Harris for president last week.About 80 percent of the $45 million will go to television and digital advertising, according to a person familiar with the spending who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The full list of candidates that the money will support will be determined over the coming weeks. Some of the money is expected to support local candidates Everytown has recruited through its “Demand a Seat” program, which encourages activists and survivors of gun violence to run for public office.Bloomberg, one of the biggest donors to Democratic politics, gave $19 million this year to Future Forward, a super PAC supporting Harris, and nearly $1 million to the coordinated Democratic presidential campaign, which at the time was supporting President Biden before he left the presidential race. Bloomberg remains a donor to Everytown, but the group also raises money from its grassroots efforts.Everytown announced a $60 million spending plan before the 2020 election aimed at defeating then-President Donald Trump and electing more Democrats who support gun regulations."
WaPo_33,Biden urges Congress to get tougher on fentanyl traffickers,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/31/biden-fentanyl-penalties/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"The White House on Wednesday backed proposals to permanently stiffen penalties on synthetic drug traffickers, monitor machines used to make fentanyl pills and close a loophole that allows criminal groups to easily ship drugs in packages.President Biden announced the initiatives as state and federal officials from both political parties grapple with how to curb a drug epidemic that has killed more than 300,000 people during his administration.The crisis is fueled by fentanyl, the potent synthetic opioid manufactured by Mexican criminal groups and smuggled into the United States. Border security has proved to be a political flash point, with Republicans hammering the White House about the failure to stop fentanyl from entering the country.Biden, who dropped out of the presidential race and is endorsing Vice President Harris against former president Donald Trump, urged Congress to greenlight a bipartisan border security bill that passed the Senate but died in the GOP-controlled House.“These are the key investments needed to stop fentanyl from reaching our communities,” Biden said in a statement.The announcement came six days after the dramatic arrest of longtime senior Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and one of the sons of notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera. The younger Guzmán, Joaquín Guzmán López, pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Chicago federal court. The 76-year-old Zambada remains in federal custody. Guzmán Loera is serving a life prison sentence after his conviction in 2019.Biden also issued a national security memo calling on federal agencies “to do even more” to stop fentanyl trafficking.The proposals include adopting permanent restrictions on chemical variants of fentanyl often found on the streets. Under Trump, federal authorities in 2018 temporarily placed all substances related to fentanyl, or analogues, in a category reserved for the riskiest of controlled substances. That category, Schedule I, is reserved for substances such as heroin and LSD, and can result in more severe prison sentences.The Halt Fentanyl Act, passed in the House with bipartisan support last year, would make the classification of analogues permanent. But critics, including some Senate Democrats, argued the bill would enshrine tough mandatory sentences that would disproportionately affect communities of color, while making it more difficult to research fentanyl variants that might be medically beneficial.“The Biden administration is more committed to maintaining the appearance of vigorous punishment for drug trafficking than learning the lessons of the drug war,” Liz Komar, an attorney for the Sentencing Project, a D.C. nonprofit organization that advocates for more humane sentences, said Tuesday.Fentanyl itself, which can be prescribed by doctors as a legal painkiller, is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance. Illicit fentanyl has flooded the United States alongside its analogues, compounds similar in molecular structure and often just as deadly, if not more so.A senior Biden administration official said the proposals also include making xylazine, the animal tranquilizer that is increasingly added to fentanyl and causes skin infections, a Schedule III substance, mirroring bills with bipartisan support. The measure would make dealing in xylazine a federal crime, although there would be exceptions for legitimate veterinarian use.Biden also proposed creating a national registry that would allow law enforcement to track presses used to make fentanyl pills disguised as legal prescription drugs. Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized nearly 80 million fake pills, most containing fentanyl. The machines are easily purchased online. The agency has warned e-commerce companies that they are required to report sales of the machines to law enforcement.For federal law enforcement, disrupting the global synthetic drug supply chain has proved vexing. Mexican criminal groups secure precursor chemicals from China, which arrive through the mail.The Justice Department has increasingly targeted Chinese nationals and companies accused of knowingly dealing the chemicals to organized-crime groups. Last fall, as Biden met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing agreed to step up counternarcotics cooperation targeting the country’s vast chemical industry.In June, a 48-year-old Chinese national was arrested in New York on allegations that he participated in a plot to import more than 2,000 kilograms of precursor chemicals from China into the United States and bound for Mexico. The shipments entered the country without a detailed inspection of the contents, the Justice Department said.The White House proposal would also make it easier for border officials to “track and target the millions of small-dollar shipments that cross our borders every day — closing a loophole that drug traffickers exploit.” The White House did not offer details, but members of Congress have introduced legislation to close the “de minimis loophole” that allows parcels valued at less than $800 to avoid customs duties — leading to a dramatic increase in packages from Chinese e-commerce companies.Last week, families of fentanyl victims, law enforcement officials and nonprofit groups sent a letter to Biden saying the loophole lets bad actors hide counterfeit pills, chemicals used to make fentanyl and pill presses among the millions of packages that arrive daily from abroad.Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), who has sponsored a bill to close the loophole, welcomed Biden’s proposed measures. In a statement on Wednesday, Blumenauer said China’s “abuse” of the loophole is to blame for fentanyl and precursor chemicals “ravaging our country.”“I welcome today’s announcement, but it does not negate the need for Congress to act on my proposal to close the deadly de minimis loophole once and for all,” Blumenauer said."
WaPo_34,How coconuts and irony helped Democrats take back the meme wars,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/31/kamala-coconut-memes-irony-left-liberals/,2024-07-31 17:00:02.650181,,"In 2016, while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were duking it out on the campaign trail, a second and perhaps more consequential skirmish was unfolding on a different battlefield. This was a clash over aesthetics, and it took place online. The weapons deployed in this second war were not attack ads or pleas for donations but irreverent (and sometimes downright offensive) political memes.Traditionally, transgression has been a leftist specialty. But Trump is not the familiar breed of stuffy, patrician Republican. He is a more flamboyant species, prone to outrageous antics, and the group of pathologically online reactionaries known as the alt-right sensed that he could help them reclaim the coveted mantle of edginess. First on obscure far-right message boards, then on more mainstream sites such as Reddit and Breitbart News, they launched what they called the Great Meme War in an effort to get him elected. Their ammunition consisted of funny pictures and pithy phrases designed to be replicated and circulated — the stuff of which digital culture is made.Pepe, a cartoon frog with bulging eyes, was quickly enlisted as their mascot. Once an innocuous figure who appeared in comics on Myspace, Pepe had a disarmingly cutesy appearance that clashed conspicuously with his new ideology. Soon, he was a fixture of anonymous message boards such as 8chan and 4chan, where he wore Nazi regalia or proclaimed, “Kill all Jews.” He was succeeded by a cavalcade of equally dicey characters: Giga Chad, a muscular personality who typified the sort of hyper-masculinity that the internet’s resident sexists hoped to revive, would eventually show up in a controversial anti-LGBTQ+ video posted by the Ron DeSantis presidential campaign.It’s probably not possible to measure the effect of the Great Meme War on the results of the 2016 presidential election (though it is certainly significant that some of Trump’s campaign staffers were avowed meme enthusiasts). Still, the meme warriors won an important victory, regardless of their impact on the polls. They helped to unify the motley crew of evangelicals, GOP stalwarts and MAGA die-hards that makes up Trump’s base by employing a potent political tool: irony.The posts containing Chads and Pepes were sarcastic — or were they? For that matter, were the people who posted them serious or joking? No one knew for sure, and that was precisely the point. An ironic movement could accommodate all comers. Dyed-in-the-wool racists and sexists could interpret the nastiest memes literally and sign on to a campaign they saw as a front for white supremacy; Republicans who sought to maintain a veneer of respectability could insist that they were just kidding around; and contrarians without firm political convictions could be conscripted solely because they liked to make liberals angry.In the hazy space between sincerity and satire was a dark glimmer of political possibility.For the intervening eight years, the fragile liberal-left alliance failed to challenge the right’s monopoly on meming, both in the United States and abroad. As the novelist Jessi Jezewska Stevens lamented in a recent essay on her Substack, “the loss of leftist ‘cool’” is in part responsible for the staggering triumph of the far right in the E.U. elections last month. In Europe, as in America, she writes, reactionary populists have “an anti-establishment online streak that is especially attractive to younger generations.” By way of illustration, she cites a sign erected by a progressive youth organization in Germany. The poster reads, roughly, “Voting is like brushing your teeth: If you don’t, things will turn brown.” There is a pun at work — the “brownshirts,” of course, were Nazi paramilitary officers — but the image is still uninvitingly nagging. To all but a few neurotics, dental hygiene is not very enthralling.The Biden campaign was similarly deflating. He, too, relied on chiding moral appeals about the future of democracy. He, too, had no apparent sense of humor. His slogan, “Let’s finish the job,” was vaguely menacing, and somehow consistent with a dentist’s desperate calls to floss more vigorously. Not only did the Democratic Party’s standard-bearer seem determined to lose, but he also seemed determined to be mortifyingly earnest. There was no way to support his campaign without identifying with it entirely.Enter, then, the coconut meme.In a clip that has become ubiquitous, Vice President Harris asks, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?” She pauses to laugh knowingly, then continues, “You exist in the context of all in which you live and all that came before you.”Funnily enough, the initial context for this statement is now unimportant. As it happens, Harris was delivering a speech about economic and educational inequality at the White House in 2023 when she spoke these fateful lines, but the coconut has transcended its origins. Since Harris’s coronation as the likely Democratic nominee, the clip has been edited to remixes of popular songs, including Charli XCX’s “360” and Chappell Roan’s “Femininomenon”; lawmakers have posted photos of themselves climbing coconut trees or emerging onto the steps of the Capitol sipping drinks out of a coconut; and videos of people toppling down the stairs have appeared with captions such as “kamala falling from the coconut tree and into the oval office.” The line has been quoted and re-quoted, shared and reshared, in a burst of collective giddiness.Suddenly, I was getting invitations to coconut parties, and people were adding the coconut emoji to their bios on X. Did these coconut enthusiasts actually like Harris? Or were they mocking her? I couldn’t tell. I asked my husband, and he said he couldn’t tell, either, even though he has a coconut emoji in his own bio.The coconut craze has even charmed leftists with plenty of reasons to hesitate before wholeheartedly warming to Harris. After all, “Copmala,” as she was nicknamed by skeptics during her previous presidential bid, is a former prosecutor with a history of pro-police stances — and although she has pointedly distanced herself from the president’s support for the Israel-Gaza war, she is still associated with an administration embroiled in a conflict that is wildly unpopular among younger and more progressive voters.Matthew Sitman, co-host of the popular leftist podcast “Know Your Enemy,” told me that he added the coconut and tree emojis to his bio on X to “signal my newfound enthusiasm for Kamala Harris,” but added that this enthusiasm was “tinged with irony.” “It’s kind of complicated,” he said. “I haven’t actually been persuaded that Kamala Harris is amazing, but she’s an immense relief to me. My enthusiasm, ... it’s for Harris, yes, but it’s also for a human being who can string sentences together and could actually beat Donald Trump.”Nathan Robinson, founder and editor of the leftist magazine Current Affairs, is largely in agreement with Sitman, although he has a more pessimistic spin. He marveled that, “seemingly overnight,” Harris’s “muddled word salads and platitudes have gone from making her a political liability to being grist for some kind of semi-facetious personality cult.” But he thinks the coconut phenomenon is “kind of a sad sign of how weak the left is, that the best thing we can do is convince ourselves that we can accept having Kamala Harris forced on us without any process if we embrace her with a certain level of irony.”Perhaps the left-liberal détente will not last forever: Leftist Guardian columnist Osita Nwanevu told me that, although “the language of the internet might be obscuring that divide a little bit, ... it will probably become clearer as the election progresses.”Still, for now, I don’t think it’s coincidental that the left and the liberal center are more unified than I have ever seen them. If love means never having to say you’re sorry, then irony means never having to say you’re serious.The painfully sincere Biden campaign failed to excite the Democratic base, and it scared off many of the leftists with reservations about his friendly relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his age or his bungled withdrawal from Afghanistan. But the euphoric meming around Harris has allowed a wide range of members of the Democratic-leaning electorate to coalesce around her without having to commit to everything she stands for. Irony is playful and capacious enough to permit simultaneous endorsement and ridicule.In other words, it is the aesthetic required for the emergence of a coalition — a delicate and hard-earned achievement that most certainly does not just fall out of a coconut tree."
WaPo_35,"‘The perfect storm times three’: Crime, political chaos divide Oakland",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/31/oakland-crime-fbi-recalls/,2024-07-31 18:00:06.418004,,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Just when things were looking especially dire for the leadership of this proud Bay Area city, they got worse. And worse.First, angry voters pushed a recall of Mayor Sheng Thao. Then the FBI raided her home. In between, a hail of bullets cut through a joyous Juneteenth celebration in one of the city’s worst mass shootings in years, which wounded 15 and reinforced criticism that Thao and other elected officials had not done enough to keep residents safe.This all unfolded over just 38 hours last month, a dizzying series of developments on its own. But even before that span, Oakland was experiencing exceptional upheaval.In addition to the contentious recall against Thao, which is ramping up ahead of the November election, Oakland voters will decide whether to oust their county’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Pamela Price. The city has also faced a staggering budget deficit and an exodus of businesses, most notably — and painfully — its major pro sports teams.Other long-standing and widespread issues, like homelessness and affordability, have left Oakland in a funk, enduring one of the darkest periods in memory.“In the movie ‘The Perfect Storm,’ two storms were colliding. This would be the perfect storm times three — it’s multiple crises all happening at one time,” said Jim Ross, an Oakland-based Democratic political consultant. “For the city, I can’t think of a tougher time.”The recent run of bad news has revived some of the most pernicious stereotypes about Oakland, which so often finds itself in the shadow of its glitzier neighbor across the bay. But the image of the city as crime-ridden and dysfunctional — one often promoted gleefully in right-wing media — obscures the whole story.Oakland, a majority-minority city of 430,000 beloved for its diversity, is home to world-class cuisine, a vibrant arts scene and abundant natural beauty. It birthed the Black Panther Party and launched the careers of some of the nation’s most influential figures, from Chief Justice Earl Warren to Vice President Harris. And housing prices remain high, underscoring Oakland’s status as one of the country’s most desirable places to live.That means residents are left to navigate a split-screen city, where the burg is either flourishing or flailing, depending on who one asks and where one looks.To former Oakland mayor Jean Quan, who fended off her own attempted recall in 2012, it’s a familiar dynamic.“I know from being mayor that it’s sometimes not about what’s really happening,” she said, “but about how people feel.”Long a critical issue in low-income neighborhoods, crime’s prevalence citywide has jolted residents. And the perception of public safety has become a divisive political subject.Thao and others have shared stats showing crime on the decline, while Price backers highlight her office’s work charging suspects. Supporters of both note that the city’s murder rate is far lower than the peaks of the 1990s and 2000s. Meanwhile, their critics point to viral videos of brazen criminal acts and the string of institutions that have fled a city they deem too dangerous.But a Washington Post analysis shows a more complicated, nuanced picture.During this year’s first five months, Oakland’s overall crime rate dipped compared to the same period last year. The Post’s analysis, which focused only on data through May to account for a lag time in reporting, found homicides specifically have dropped by nearly 20 percent year over year. Other violent crimes, like assault and robbery, have occurred at about the same rate or have declined slightly.Taking a longer view, the analysis found the city’s homicide rate through May is also lower than the average over the past five years, a period that includes the coronavirus pandemic, when violence surged.Oakland’s crime decrease follows a national pattern, according to a database of incidents maintained by The Post, which includes data from about 85 police departments in America’s largest cities. Across this group, homicides have decreased by 22 percent this year compared to 2023.But explanations of crime fluctuation are notoriously hard to determine, and troubling trends remain. Oakland’s murder rate, while declining, is still higher than the U.S. average. Like elsewhere, the city is struggling to recover from the pandemic. And even though there have been fewer killings, Oakland’s rate of robbery has more than doubled, and car theft has more than tripled since pre-pandemic years.Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced he would quadruple the state police presence in Oakland, deploying 20 highway patrol officers every day to fight retail theft and carjacking. And last week, the governor called on Oakland police to permit more car chases, saying current rules are “allowing criminals to act with impunity.”Bishop Bob Jackson, a pastor in east Oakland, has cheered the reinforcements. He said there is more “lawlessness” on city streets today than he has seen in nearly eight decades living here. From his pulpit at Acts Full Gospel Church, the largest church in Oakland with nearly 4,000 members, Jackson has been praying for his city.“We need divine intervention at this point,” he said.He is not involved in either recall effort, he said, but he said he believes Oakland needs new leadership. The more liberal elected officials, including Thao and Price, have failed to deliver on their campaign promises, he said.“I think we need, from top to bottom, a brand new slate of leaders for the city,” Jackson said. “We need a brand new city council, a brand new mayor, brand new, brand new, brand new.”The FBI raid, which also targeted a well-connected family that runs a local recycling company and the mayor’s romantic partner, has only intensified calls for Thao’s removal. Federal authorities have not commented on their investigation, and Thao has not been accused of any crimes. Subpoenas obtained by local news outlets indicate a wide-ranging probe involving the city’s financial dealings with the influential family and other power players.The mayor has forcefully denied any wrongdoing. In her public comments, she has questioned the timing of the raid, which came less than two days after the recall against her qualified for the ballot. She has accused the FBI of influencing voters’ decisions in the race.In a statement to The Post, Thao said that she is not the subject of an investigation. She said Oakland is “facing many of the same challenges that major cities across the country are facing” and that the recall campaign is a distraction from the urgent effort to address them, as well as a waste of taxpayer money.“I think it’s an incredible disservice to our democratic process, to the voters, to Oaklanders and our city,” Thao said.But her critics say she has been too slow to respond to the escalating chaos.“The reality is there is a vacuum of leadership right now,” said Justin Berton, the director of communications for Oakland’s previous mayor, Libby Schaaf. “As residents, we’re not hearing from anyone. It’s leaving this unsettling feeling across the city that no one is driving the car.”Quan, who also faced a recall less than a year into her mayor term, said she wished the public had given Thao more time to deal with issues that began well before her tenure.“It’s always the mayor’s fault, no matter what’s happening, and you have to deal with it,” Quan said.Thao was elected in 2022 after running on a platform to reduce crime through community policing initiatives. Following her narrow victory — by just under 700 votes — her rivals called for a recount, an early sign of the headwinds she would face in her first year, which closed with the announcement of the active recall effort.Thao deserves recognition for the recent decrease in homicides, Quan said. She praised the mayor for reviving Ceasefire, a violence intervention program started under Quan that has been credited with reducing killings.“Some problems take years to start and years to fight back,” Quan said. “I empathize with her because I know what happened with me. I hadn’t had a chance to do anything, and I had to worry about the recall.”Such campaigns, long a popular political tool in California, have been increasingly employed on the local level, most notably across the Bay Bridge, where San Francisco’s district attorney and three school board members were booted in 2022. Critics of Price launched their recall about halfway through the first year of her term.“Many people in Oakland play politics as a blood sport,” said Margaretta Lin, a UC Berkeley public policy professor who worked closely with former mayors Quan and Ron Dellums.The mayor has also had to navigate a fraying of the social fabric, Lin said, brought on by rapid gentrification that has driven up the cost of living and displaced thousands of lifelong residents, changing the city’s racial and economic demographics. The pandemic made everything worse.“Because of that erosion of community, when you’re hit with a crisis, you don’t have the muscle memory of working together to weather it,” Lin said. “And instead we play the blame game and point fingers.”Oakland — or, as residents affectionately know it, the Town, as opposed to the City across the bay — appears to be in no mood to unify, said Ross, the political strategist.“There’s always been a tendency in Oakland of, ‘We have it hard enough, why should we fight with each other?’” Ross said. “And I think this whole saga marks the end of that.”But if there’s anything that reliably brings people here together, it’s showing outsiders they are wrong about Oakland.Residents readily acknowledge the city’s issues, but they bristle when media portray only its troubles, reinforcing tropes they’ve worked for decades to dispel.Such coverage overlooks — willfully, some would argue — the best parts of the city. The parts that people like Kim Bardakian have been talking about for years. Bardakian, a native New Yorker, moved to Oakland in 2002, and she speaks about it with a convert’s zeal.A communications specialist, she used to work for Visit Oakland, the city’s tourism bureau, as a professional booster. But even in her current job, at an Oakland-based nonprofit, she can’t resist leading new hires on a tour of city highlights: churros in Fruitvale, bay views from the Oakland Hills and the picturesque 3-mile path around Lake Merritt near downtown.Bardakian said Oakland is like “the Brooklyn of the West.”“It’s sometimes looked at like the stepchild, but just like Brooklyn has come up and is hip and artsy, so has Oakland,” she said.On a recent evening in Jack London Square, where bars and restaurants are clustered on the city’s waterfront, Vernon Freeman and Valerie Vlorie paused to consider a question about the state of their hometown.“It just depends on what sector you’re talking about,” said Freeman, who grew up in west Oakland. “If you’re talking about government, it’s been going downhill for years.”But the city is so much more than its political dysfunction and dire headlines, he said. The square, sun drenched during a summertime happy hour, is a prime example. Near a statue of the district’s namesake author, Shane Barker played his guitar as gulls circled overhead and cranes from the city’s famous seaport towered in the distance.“Government politics, corruption, all these things aside,” said Barker, a 40-year-old who has lived in Oakland nearly half his life, “the people are still strong, and we still stick together as a community.”"
WaPo_36,School taught JD Vance to see a divided nation — and to use that division,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/31/jd-vance-education-ohio-state-yale/,2024-07-31 18:00:06.418004,,"On a trip home to Ohio soon after starting at Yale Law School, JD Vance stopped for gas and noticed a woman in a Yale T-shirt. When he asked about it, she said her nephew attended the Ivy League school — and asked whether Vance did, too.“I had to choose: Was I a Yale Law student, or was I a Middletown kid with hillbilly grandparents?” Vance recalled in his memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”If he admitted going to Yale, he and the woman “could exchange pleasantries,” Vance wrote. But if he denied his Yale ties, the woman would deem him one of “the unsophisticates of Ohio [who] clung to their guns and religion.” An unbridgeable gap would open: The woman would move to “the other side of an invisible divide,” Vance wrote.His fear in that moment has since become a theory he often repeats: that America is a divided nation, split between liberal elites and regular, conservative people. It was a keynote theme of his best-selling book, which earned national acclaim, became a movie and paved his way to the U.S. Senate — and, this summer, helped him earn the vice-presidential nod from Donald Trump.In a speech accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention this month, Vance sounded the same note, lamenting the “divide between the few, with their power and comfort in Washington, and the rest of us.” Then he promised to surmount it: “I will be a vice president,” he said, “who never forgets where he came from.”It was his years at Ohio State University and Yale Law that taught Vance to see America as divided, and how to use that division, according to a review of his public and private writings at Ohio State and Yale, as well as interviews with more than a dozen of Vance’s friends, former classmates and professors. At first, Vance pitched himself as an author who could explain the divide, people interviewed said. In later years, he became a politician who would build his appeal around it.A spokeswoman for the Vance campaign declined to comment.Opponents allege that Vance is drawing on skills and insight gained through his privileged education to exploit national division for personal and political gain.“He is using his tremendous intelligence and thoughtfulness to deliberately choose contempt as a political strategy, as opposed to building the bridges he used to talk about building,” said Josh McLaurin, a Democratic senator from Georgia who was Vance’s roommate at Yale and is an outspoken critic of his politics.Supporters agreed that school made Vance more aware of the country’s political, cultural and socioeconomic split. He used that knowledge, and his experience with the working and wealthy classes, to reach people on either side, they said.“He had his feet in different camps [at Ohio State and Yale], which shaped a lot of who he is,” said a friend from Vance’s college years, who has remained close to the lawmaker and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his family from a volatile political environment. “It allowed him to develop a brand of politics tailored to what people care about.”At 39, Vance is relatively young to reach such national prominence. His formative college and law school years have become pivotal, in his own telling, to the public figure and now vice-presidential nominee he has become.During that gas station encounter in 2011, though, Vance had just begun to see his country as fundamentally fractured, and to figure out his place within it. He lied to the woman, telling her he didn’t go to Yale, Vance wrote in his book.Then he drove away.At Ohio State, fresh off a four-year stint in the Marine Corps, Vance fit in, but he didn’t stand out, his classmates said.Simon Kapenda, who said he took classes with him, recalled Vance as smart, quiet and punctual. The only reason Kapenda remembered Vance, years later, was because of the time a professor asked veterans to stand in class.Kapenda was astonished to see Vance rise. “He was like a baby boy … clean-shaven guy, short hair,” Kapenda said. “I’m looking at him, this little boy, he looked very young then, and I’m thinking, ‘He was actually in the Marines?’”Vance had a few nerdier habits in college, said one friend from those years, including his love for the Lord of the Rings and a yen for the game Magic: The Gathering. But mostly, “JD was just like a very normal guy,” the friend said. He was openly Republican — sharing his strong support for John McCain in a 2008 interview with the student newspaper — but that raised no eyebrows at Ohio State, the friend said.Vance developed a circle of close buddies, almost all from his hometown, the friend said. Vance later wrote in “Hillbilly Elegy” that “virtually all” of his Ohio State friends were from southwest Ohio, making college feel “very familiar.” Vance drank socially, but not to excess, the friend recalled.His easygoing life was upended at Yale Law.When Vance arrived in New Haven, Conn., he was suddenly “the cultural alien,” he wrote in “Hillbilly Elegy,” bewildered by Yale’s “bizarre … social rituals,” the elegant cocktail receptions and banquets hosted in gorgeous Gothic buildings.McLaurin, who attended the University of Georgia as an undergraduate, said he and Vance were among a small number of students who came from state colleges. He remembered arriving at one party where nobody could figure out how to tap a keg. Finally, McLaurin said, someone called out: “Where are the state schools? Bring them over!”Early on, Vance drew critical feedback from a professor known for saying public school students had no place at Yale Law, which should only admit Ivy League and Stanford graduates, according to an account in his book and a friend he told at the time.At Yale, “I can understand why anybody would feel like an outsider, coming from a state school,” McLaurin said.Vance’s financial status also undermined his sense of belonging, he wrote in his book, calling himself “one of the poorest kids” on campus. He paid for Yale through a combination of student loans, generous financial aid and the Yellow Ribbon Program, a Department of Veterans Affairs initiative that helps veterans afford private, graduate or out-of-state schools.But his political views left him feeling most isolated.The majority of campus was left-leaning, several Yale attendees said. Vance soon found a half-dozen other students who were moderate or conservative and who formed a tightknit subgroup, said Sam Lim, another member.The group didn’t spend all of their time talking politics — they played fantasy football, threw darts at a local bar, held movie nights and took a spring break road trip to Savannah, Ga. — but their right-leaning views, and lower- and middle-class upbringings, glued them together, according to Lim.The group’s irritation with Yale’s liberal orthodoxy crested whenever students began discussing politics over a Yale Law chat group known as the Wall. Lim remembered exchanges about affirmative action, in which it was taboo to offer any criticism. Vance, he said, was especially careful to shield his political views to avoid blowback.“We would have our own internal discussion because we knew we couldn’t say things schoolwide,” Lim said. “JD, even then, was more political about what he would say, but we would talk about how it was just a very liberal place.”Dan Driscoll, who started at Yale a year after Vance but became a lifelong friend, recalled Vance as frustrated by his inability to speak freely.“Thought partnership or sparring is hard to do when it’s so weighted to one side,” said Driscoll, who now serves as a senior adviser to the Vance campaign. “He found that a bit intellectually stifling.”Occasionally, though, Vance’s restraint cracked — as in April 2013, when he wrote to the Wall message group to complain about a bad experience with the Internal Revenue Service.The IRS was asking to verify information on his tax return before sending him a refund, he wrote in a message obtained by The Washington Post, which proves “that my conservative political beliefs are beyond reproach.” He added, “If I don’t get my refund by the time I graduate … I’ll be left to conclude that the Obama administration targets political enemies through tax laws.”He signed off the message: “My apologies for the spam.”In interviews, three Yale classmates separately recalled that message as their strongest memory of Vance — and a strikingly odd and bitter use of the Wall.Whatever he felt about the school, Vance quickly found ways to make Yale work for him.Other students recalled him as able to smooth and shape himself to fit any setting. He “had no trouble bridging seemingly disparate social groups,” said James Eimers, who attended Yale at the same time Vance did.He at times espoused liberal viewpoints, classmates said. Once, Vance worked with a women’s group, now known as Yale Law Women+ — and which today describes itself as advocating for “women and traditionally underrepresented gender identities” — to recruit students to attend a conversation about making legal practice “family-friendly,” according to an email obtained by The Post.He also invited a Marine Corps major to campus to discuss the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and “what challenges still remain,” as well as “life in the military as a woman, the military’s approach to transgendered individuals, the combat exclusion of women, and so forth,” according to another email obtained by The Post. “It should be very interesting,” Vance wrote, “please come.”Yale classmate Sofia Nelson, once a close friend, said Vance shared “progressive-minded” views in class and in private during their law school years — offering support for LGBTQ rights and voicing concern over police brutality and racial equity.“At the time, I certainly believed it was genuine, now I suspect that he pulled a fast one on me,” said Nelson, who is transgender.Nelson also recalled Vance waxing “vicious” in his critique of Yale’s “elite” culture, but noted he wasted no time in figuring out how to plumb the school’s vast resources, especially its well-connected professors who could provide entree to prestigious summer jobs.Vance’s first summer, he finagled his way into a job with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) with help from one of his professors, according to an account Vance published in a pamphlet put out by Yale Law’s Career Development Office.“People get jobs on the Hill in a variety of ways, but the common denominator seems to be that you must know somebody,” he wrote. Vance didn’t know anybody, he wrote, but “a professor wrote me a very good letter of recommendation.”Once in D.C., Vance was enthralled by his access to power: “It was very cool to be an ‘insider,’” he wrote in the pamphlet.An especially important connection was with Amy Chua, a popular professor with a reputation for mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds — but who has come under fire in recent years for allegations of inappropriate socializing with students. Chua has said she did nothing wrong.“Amy was an incredibly powerful force in JD’s life,” Driscoll said.Chua — who did not respond to requests for comment — convinced Vance that he should write a book about his upbringing, according to a joint interview that Vance and Chua gave to the Atlantic in 2017.He would soon follow her advice, turning his life story into career jet fuel.In Vance’s final year at Yale, he convened a reading group about “social decline in white America,” meant to dissect why the White working class had become “the least socially and economically mobile group” in the United States, according to emails obtained by The Post. He set attendees a reading schedule that included “The White Underclass,” “Appalachia’s Path to Dependency” and “The Hill-Billies Come to Detroit.”At the group’s first gathering, Vance said he was thinking about writing a book, said John James “J.J.” Snidow, a member of the group. In subsequent meetings, Vance raised a lot of the topics he talks about in “Hillbilly Elegy,” using the reading group — which included conservative and liberal students, Snidow said — to test out his ideas.“We got a very early peek at what the rest of the country was eventually going to see” in the book, Snidow said. “He really wanted to see what people would think.”Some saw hypocrisy in Vance’s use of what Yale had to give.“He was simultaneously finding resources for his own advancement at the school while criticizing or being skeptical of many other aspects of it,” said McLaurin, his former roommate. “He fancied himself an outsider but ended up using resources at the school … to get his book deal.”In the years after graduation, Vance drew partly on his Yale-fueled book success to ascend traditional rungs of power, winning a U.S. Senate seat in 2022. He also began to hone his message about two warring Americas, testing its political efficacy, according to his public and private writings and people who knew him.By the 2016 presidential election, Vance was closely watching Trump’s success and pondering what drove it, according to an email he sent to his classmate Nelson in November of that year, which Nelson provided to The Post as part of a years-long conversation first reported by the New York Times. Trump had tapped into a “feeling of alienation from mainstream culture,” Vance wrote to Nelson. “If there’s a feeling of resentment that drives Trumpism, it’s the resentment of other white people who think they’re better than you.”He added: “There’s a core cultural divide … that is driving the ship. That’s my guess.”A year later, when Vance returned to Yale in 2017 to give a talk about “Hillbilly Elegy,” he spent much of the half-hour speech discussing how the university introduced him to America’s ruling upper class, said Christopher Cappello, a student who attended. Cappello was jarred, he said, by the way Vance distanced himself from so-called elites, while adopting their mannerisms and dress. The talk was held in a snazzy ballroom, and most everyone was wearing boat shoes and blazers, Cappello said.“The ease with which Vance presented himself in that setting made clear, despite the difficulties he was describing, that he had very successfully assimilated,” Cappello said. “He gave off this impression: He wanted to be everything to everybody.”In more recent years, Vance has called higher education “the enemy,” proposed legislation targeting colleges and urged fellow Republicans to “honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” He wrote on the social media platform X in January that “elite universities … give credentials that signal fake merit rather than rely on real excellence.”In the same post, Vance exhorted so-called normal Americans to “ignore,” “mock” and “scorn” “our entire elite,” from public health experts to economists to doctors to attorneys. “You are ruled by thousands of people who are … mediocre,” Vance wrote, before urging his audience to throw off the yoke.Most recently, he wrote the foreword to a forthcoming book by Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that led publication of Project 2025, a 900-plus-page plan for the next Republican administration that Trump called “ridiculous and abysmal.” (On Tuesday, leaders of Project 2025 announced they were shuttering operations after facing fury from Trump advisers and critical news coverage, The Post reported.)Roberts’s book argues that institutions including the Education Department and Ivy League colleges are “too corrupt to save” and must be “dissolved,” according to publishing materials. In a review, Vance wrote that Roberts is articulating “a genuinely new future for conservatism,” adding that “it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets.”George L. Priest, a Yale professor who taught Vance, said the candidate he sees onstage, and the policies Vance advances, do not resemble the student he knew. In Priest’s course on antitrust law, the professor recalled, Vance seemed to accept what Priest had to say in favor of a free market.But now, “the basic lessons of the course he doesn’t seem to have remembered, as he describes his support for tariffs and opposition to immigration,” Priest said.Nelson, Vance’s Yale classmate, said they are disgusted to see Vance discard his support for LGBTQ+ rights: “He’s willing to adopt whatever positions to amass money and power … his only real core value is advancing his career.”A former classmate and good friend at Yale, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his career, said he saw no hypocrisy.Asked whether Vance had changed since law school, the classmate said Vance is now savvy enough to “maintain MAGA credibility and still work with people from the other side of the aisle.” He added, “The thing I see in him, he’s gotten to a point where he’s learned, he knows — he’s learned how politics works.”Peter Jamison and Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report."

WaPo_38,Prince George’s County opens first 24/7 mental health care center,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/prince-georges-county-opens-first-247-mental-health-care-center/,2024-07-31 18:00:06.418004,,"Yolanda Gales waited in a hospital ambulance bay last week, watching a 70-year-old woman in handcuffs. The woman had been detained by police and brought to the hospital as part of an emergency petition — a court order mandating she receive an urgent mental health evaluation.Six and a half hours later, the woman still hadn’t received medical attention. And by the time Gales finally left the hospital close to midnight, the woman still sat there, hands cuffed.“That’s traumatizing in and of itself,” said Gales, a program director with the Prince George’s County mobile crisis response team.Gales recalled the story this week as officials gathered to unveil what they say is the solution to the waiting game so many in crises have been forced to endure — a 16-bed emergency mental health center staffed 24/7 and designed to eliminate harmful wait times.“We can usher people here and they can get the help that they need because the hospitals are clearly overwhelmed,” Gales said. “We’ve been waiting a long time for this to open up.”The Dyer Care Center, named for inventor Leonard Dyer, is a first-of-its kind behavioral health crisis stabilization center in Maryland that has been in the works for four years. Funded by a $23 million grant from the Health Services Cost Review Commission, the center located in Clinton, Md., will be open to patients within the next 30 days.Once at the Dyer Care Center, patients can spend 23 hours there receiving specialized behavioral care that meets their immediate needs.The opening of the center is a notable achievement for the administration of County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), who has made the expansion of mental health resources in Prince George’s a key part of her plan for residents — and emphasized the issues in her current bid for U.S. Senate against former governor Larry Hogan (R).“At the beginning of my administration, Prince George’s County was a behavioral health desert,” Alsobrooks said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new center Monday morning.“Prince George’s County has suffered for a long time from lack of investment,” she told the crowd of about a hundred people, hinting at a systemic lack of resources in majority Black and Latino Prince George’s. “This investment is really huge for our county.”The center includes a group therapy room, a psychiatric consult room, a seclusion and restraint room, a quiet room and a restroom that is designed to prevent people from harming themselves. Patients can admit themselves to the center, be directed there through the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline or be brought in by law enforcement or mobile response teams.In addition to minimizing lengthy wait times at hospitals, the center aims to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations or incarcerations.Officers with the Prince George’s County Police Department are often asked to respond to 911 or other calls for service involving people who are known to be or suspected of experiencing a mental health crisis. In those situations, officers have the legal power to petition for a person to receive an emergency evaluation at a hospital.Officers exerted that power 907 times in 2023, according to the department, and have taken people for evaluation more than 450 times so far this year.Alsobrooks said that, during her previous job as the county’s top prosecutor, she learned that more than 70 percent of people arrested in Prince George’s were intoxicated and more than a third of people were on psychotropic medications.“We are largely arresting and recycling people who are suffering with mental health and addiction and putting them in places where they could not be healed,” Alsobrooks said, “until now.”At the unveiling, Maryland’s Secretary of Health Laura Herrera Scott applauded the county for taking a wholistic approach to mental health care and creating non-punitive infrastructures so that mental health episodes are less likely to be criminalized.“Regardless of where you live, your age, your race, your ethnicity, your health insurance status, you have someplace to contact, and that’s our statewide 988 line, someone to respond and that’s our mobile community health crisis team,” Herrera Scott said. “But, more importantly, somewhere safe to get help, stabilize and get connected to ongoing care and that’s where the Dyer Care Center comes in.”Lori Werrell, board chairman of the six-hospital nonprofit Totally Linking Care in Maryland, said she hopes emergency calls reporting mental health crises will become less likely to turn violent once the center has opened.“Law enforcement will know they have a behavioral health partner,” Werrell said. “All they have to do is call. That joint response theoretically should minimize the number of times things escalate because there’s somebody else with a different skill set able to intervene.”Prince George’s County Sheriff John D.B. Carr was in the crowd for Monday’s unveiling and said in an interview after that the Dyer Center will have an immediate, measurable impact on the work of his deputies.In the county, sheriff’s deputies are the ones who carry out court-ordered emergency petitions for mental health evaluations by physically going to the location of a person experiencing a psychiatric crises, taking them into custody and transporting them to a hospital.Carr’s deputies, who are specially trained to work with those in crisis, respond to an average of 100 court-ordered petitions a month. Often, he said, the people they pick up have to sit in handcuffs for hours waiting for an available bed. In the past, he said, patients have waited as long as seven hours.“They don’t need to be treated as criminals,” Carr said. “They need to be given that additional help they need.”Now, Carr said, his deputies will be able to take someone directly to the Dyer Center at any hour of the day.“We have a lot of individuals who are dealing with mental health crises, and unfortunately they don’t know how to get the resources,” Carr said. “Instead of suffering in silence, they now have somewhere to go.”The center currently has a 16-person capacity but may expand in the future, Werrell said. Regardless if someone is brought in against their will through an emergency petition or voluntarily seeks help, Werrell said the Dyer Care Center operates under a “no wrong door” philosophy in which no one gets turned away.“Anyone can walk through that door,” Werrell said. “And whatever help they need or want or are willing to accept, they will get.”If you or someone you know needs help, visit 988lifeline.org or call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988."
WaPo_39,‘Blair Witch’ fans haunted Burkittsville. Now the town is beckoning them.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/07/31/blair-witch-burkittsville/,2024-07-31 17:59:06.418004,,"BURKITTSVILLE, MD.Eduardo Sánchez couldn’t believe he was back in the town that should hate him.He’d first arrived in Burkittsville — a village of fewer than 200 people at the base of South Mountain, about 15 miles west of Frederick, Md. — in early 1997 with his college pal and co-director, Daniel Myrick. They were scouting locations for a micro-budget horror flick about three student documentarians investigating a frightening urban legend in the Maryland woods. Satisfied with the spectral setting, the directors returned to town with a small crew and their three leads. Filming took eight days. It cost $60,000.“The Blair Witch Project” was released in theaters 25 years ago. It changed horror movies, and maybe cinema, too. But it also changed Burkittsville.First, the film was a hit out of Sundance, parlaying early buzz into a $1.1 million sale to Artisan Entertainment. Then, beginning in July 1999, it became a worldwide box-office phenomenon, grossing nearly $250 million and haunting pop culture for months. (It was satirized by not just “Saturday Night Live” but even Scooby-Doo.) Its lo-fi found-footage aesthetic — which emphasized off-screen horrors rather than blood-soaked violence or elaborate creature design — inspired a vast subgenre that fundamentally changed how studios thought about making horror movies. Without “The Blair Witch Project,” there would have been no “Cloverfield,” “REC” or the Paranormal Activity series.There also would have been fewer migraines in Burkittsville. At the height of “Blair Witch” mania, the town was inundated with superfans and, more worryingly, true believers in the movie’s faux-real premise. They caused traffic jams on the town’s two main streets, accosted locals to tell them the town wasn’t safe for their kids and, in a few cases, barged unannounced into people’s homes. “After 24 years of not doing it, I’m now locking the door,” one resident told The Washington Post at the time.
Burkittsville was, and presumably remained, ticked off.
At least that’s what Sánchez, 55, thought. “I knew the history,” he says. “There were a lot of things that happened that we couldn’t control, unfortunately.” Then, last year, he got an invitation from Burkittsville’s current mayor, Michael Robinson.Robinson, 49, asked whether Sánchez would come to town. Could he do a Q&A? The event would be in the parking lot behind the Burkittsville Ruritan Club, where the town holds its local council meetings.“‘Yeah, we’re going to do a screening,’” Sánchez recalls the conversation going. “I’m like, ‘Whaaaat?’”Sánchez and Myrick had been slowly developing “The Blair Witch Project” for four years when they started scouting locations in Maryland. Sánchez, who was born in Cuba but grew up in Montgomery County, was living in the state at the time, while Myrick was down in Miami.“It was kind of like a no-brainer that, of course, we’re gonna shoot it in Maryland,” Sánchez says. As a kid, he’d been drawn to the vast, spooky woods in rural parts of the state, which seemed perfect for a horror movie. During Myrick’s visits in the 1990s, they would drive around Frederick County. Eventually they stumbled upon Burkittsville, which fit the lore they were already inventing — graying hamlet, haunted forest, murderous hermit, plenty of graves.“We were on this road coming up over this hill and saw this picturesque little town with the church steeple and the cemetery, and there’s a little bit of the mountain behind it,” Sánchez says. “It’s a beautiful place. Dan and I were both like, ‘Okay, there it is. That’s the town.’” They worked some of Burkittsville’s history into their mythos. They wanted a story that uncovered an evil with antebellum roots. Burkittsville was founded in 1824. “We always wanted to create this fake timeline where something weird had been happening in this area every 50 years,” Sánchez says.
Only a few scenes in the final cut of the movie were actually filmed in Burkittsville. Rei Hance (then using her birth name, Heather Donahue), Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard — the actors playing the three doomed documentary students at the center of the film — interview locals about the town legend while recording their own establishing shots of the town cemetery. “The setup interested me because they had a faux documentary that actually explained a little bit about the town itself,” says Paul Gilligan, a longtime Burkittsville resident who was mayor from 1995 to 1998. “In terms of setting up the story, I thought that was genius. They got more of the character of [Burkittsville]: isolated, small town, no one knows where we are or who we were.”Gilligan, 77, credits the film’s found-footage style and clever early internet marketing strategy — which played up the notion that the Blair Witch and the three missing filmmakers were real — for the movie’s success. And also for unleashing a flood of people on Burkittsville.“It was this place you would never suspect had this dark history,” Sánchez says. “Now, looking back on it, we wouldn’t have set it in Burkittsville if we knew the movie would blow up the way it did.”How bad was it? “For a year straight, from sunup to sundown, there were people going by in slow cars with a camera,” says Deborah Burgoyne, 69, another former mayor of Burkittsville who has lived in the town for more than four decades. “And it was such a shock because the town didn’t know. They didn’t understand what was going on.”Reports of “Blair Witch” tourists flooding the town’s streets, goth kids skulking around the cemetery at night, and thieves stealing the “Welcome to Burkittsville” sign featured in the movie eventually became a minor news event in and of itself. “Let’s face it, the movie is not about the Waltons or Mayberry,” Mayor Joyce M. Brown told The Post at the time of the film’s release. “We are a Christian community.” While some residents at the time described getting a kick out of the attention, many more seemed to just want the “Blair Witch” visitors to go away.The incidents that stick with Burgoyne involve the people who, not realizing the story was fake, came to Burkittsville to rescue children in town from what they gathered was an actual cabal of witches, almost like a Catoctin QAnon.“They would be disappointed because they thought we were stupid locals who didn’t know [about the Blair Witch] or we were hiding something,” she says. “We brainwashed the kids who are here.”Burgoyne recalls sitting on her front porch with her then-5-year-old daughter, who had just gotten off the school bus. A woman in a Bentley with Florida license plates pulled up in front of the house and started to interrogate Burgoyne  about the Blair Witch’s whereabouts.“I’m like, ‘It’s not real.’ And she’s arguing with me, and then she realizes [my daughter] is on the porch with me, and the woman says, ‘You have children here!?’” Burgoyne recalls. “And I turned around, looked at [my daughter] and turned back to the woman and said, ‘That’s not my child; that’s my lunch!’ And I yanked her and ran back into the house.”Just over a year after the release of “The Blair Witch Project” came “Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,” a sequel that Artisan rushed into production without the involvement of Sánchez or any of the original film’s cast and crew. It also briefly filmed in Burkittsville and was universally panned.In the DVD commentary, director Joe Berlinger describes meeting with Burkittsville leaders about the project, only to be shooed out of town. “It really was like villagers with torches,” Burgoyne says of that sit-down. As it happened, that film’s plot centered on fans of the first film obsessing over its footage and descending on its setting.In real life, the fans kept coming in smaller and smaller numbers. Robinson, the current mayor, still happens upon strangers in the town cemetery every now and then.“You get the occasional people who are like, ‘I want to find the graves of the children who were murdered,’” he says. “And I have to tell them, ‘Well, they’re not real, so they’re not here. You can find a bunch of infants who died back in the 1800s because they didn’t have vaccines, though.’”Robinson differs from his predecessors in a key way: He’d like the “Blair Witch” tourists to come back.It’s not just because Robinson is a fan of the film (he stresses he’s not a die-hard), but because he thinks the town deserves to see some benefit from the landmark movie’s success. Robinson is relatively new to Burkittsville — he moved there with his family in 2016 and became mayor in 2022 — but says that he rarely hears people complaining about “Blair Witch”-related incidents these days.Others would also like Burkittsville to get its piece. Burgoyne recalls several locals trying to sell Burkittsville merchandise emblazoned with the movie’s stickman logo to tourists, only to be met with legal threats. “When they found out people in town were profiting in any way, they sent cease-and-desist orders,” she says.The three co-stars have an even bigger beef with the distributor of “The Blair Witch Project.” They recently penned an open letter asking Lionsgate, which acquired Artisan in 2003, to provide them fair compensation and back pay for their work on the film. The movie wasn’t filmed under a union contract, as Variety detailed, so Leonard, Hance and Williams have made only a tiny fraction of the movie’s earnings. Sánchez declined to comment specifically on the dispute, citing a nondisclosure agreement, but said he and the original “Blair Witch” team support the three actors’ efforts. “Generally speaking, artists are always exploited,” Sánchez says.Like its stars, Burkittsville seems to be permanently entwined with “The Blair Witch Project.” “It would be great if the town would make any money off of this stuff,” Robinson says. “Because we haven’t for 25 years.”To celebrate the film’s 25th anniversary, Robinson has organized another screening in Burkittsville in September. Like last year’s event, the profits will benefit the Burkittsville Union Cemetery — the cemetery featured in the beginning of the film — which Robinson says has experienced wear and tear from the thousands of “Blair Witch” visitors over the years. “It’s not cheap to maintain a cemetery, especially in a small town like this one,” he says.Sánchez, who went on to make more horror films and has a career directing for TV, will also be back. Before the 2023 screening, he had returned to Burkittsville only once since the original film production, to pose for photos for a 2019 article in a local newspaper about the movie’s 20th anniversary. But last year’s gathering was the first time the town rolled out the red carpet for him.Under the long, wooden pavilion behind the Burkittsville Ruritan Club, Robinson introduced Sánchez, along with a few locals who were briefly featured in the film, to a standing ovation. There were residents from Burkittsville and other nearby towns in attendance, as well as folks who traveled to the screening from all over: New York, California, the U.K.For 30 minutes or so, Sánchez took questions. But mostly, people were as shocked as he was that he had come back to town.Locals shared war stories from the aftermath. Burgoyne recalled how the Frederick County Sheriff’s Office had to divert resources to attend to the hundreds of calls it got from angry people who thought the movie was real. (A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office said it had to “pay special attention to that area for some time because of the problems the movie created for the residents.”) But in that moment, Sánchez didn’t feel bad anymore. It was clear that Burkittsville was finally proud to be the “Blair Witch” town.After the Q&A, the pavilion lights were dimmed, and a silence fell over the crowd, disturbed only by cricket chirps and the low drone of cicadas in an abutting corn field. The film’s opening title card flashed onto the screen:In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary.A year later their footage was found.The crowd cheered.Robinson remembers standing in the back with Sánchez: “About 15 minutes after it started, he turned to me and said, ‘I never thought this would happen.’”"
WaPo_40,Fed poised to keep rates steady. But rate cuts aren’t far off.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/31/fed-rate-cuts-inflation/,2024-07-31 17:59:06.418004,,"The Federal Reserve is poised to keep interest rates steady on Wednesday — though officials may offer some hints about a long-awaited rate cut that might come as soon as September.Scores of households and businesses are eager for central bankers to bring borrowing costs down from the highest level in 23 years. Rates have held steady since last July. So far, the Fed has been wary of taking even a little bit of pressure off the economy before officials are confident inflation is heading back to normal levels. But the past few months of encouraging data have Wall Street and financial analysts betting the Fed is as close as it could get — and some worry the central bank could even be waiting too long to ease up.More clarity may arrive this afternoon, when Fed leaders release a statement at the end of their two-day policy meeting at 2 p.m. Eastern. Then at 2:30, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell will take questions at a news conference, where he’ll probably be asked about the Fed’s fight against inflation, the health of the job market and timing for future cuts.The last time officials convened, in June, they penciled in just one rate cut before the end of the year, down from three a few months before that. The Fed won’t issue official projections again until September. But in the meantime, Powell could shed some light on where he and his colleagues think policy is headed — and if they even have time to cut rates during the handful of meetings left in the year.The practiced and staid that Fed chief generally holds back from forecasting too far into the future. Instead, he and his colleagues have been focused on building confidence that inflation is falling reliably down on its way to a more normal 2 percent. That’s clearly what the data show; using the Fed’s preferred gauge, inflation clocked in at 2.5 percent in June.If anything, some economists are puzzled over why the Fed isn’t cutting rates already.“We want to have greater confidence inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2 percent target, and what increases our confidence in that is more good inflation data,” Powell said at the Economic Club of D.C. this month. “And lately here, we have been getting some of that.”Fed officials are taking their time because they’ve been thwarted by the economy’s unexpected turns before. At the start of the year, a slew of hot inflation reports suggested the Fed was losing ground on its push to slow the economy, after things looked like they were cruising late in 2023. Well before that, the Fed was slow to react when prices surged in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — a mistake that forced the central bank to hoist borrowing costs in a rush to catch up. They ultimately brought the federal funds rate to between 5.25 and 5.5 percent.Through it all, though, the Fed has managed a rare feat: bringing inflation down without causing a recession or blow to the job market. The economy grew at a surprisingly strong 2.8 percent in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion. The extreme labor shortages from the pandemic have also faded away, but employers are still hiring.In the backdrop is the presidential election, where Republicans and Democrats are campaigning on vastly different plans for the economy. While the Fed is loath to get involved in politics, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Many economists, for example, warn that former president Donald Trump’s policies on higher tariffs and mass deportations would worsen inflation. If he wins in November and his agenda becomes law, the Fed’s inflation fight could be upended.In the meantime, some Fed watchers are antsy for the first cut. They argue rates that stay too high for too long can backfire, causing cracks in the labor market if employers pull back or even lay people off. Those signs haven’t emerged yet. But officials have acknowledged that they have to balance their inflation goals with protecting the labor market more evenly than they have over the past few years.For the economy as a whole, it might not matter much if the Fed cuts in July versus September. Rather, it’s about the signal. Speaking to The Washington Post this month, Boston Fed President Susan Collins noted how bumpy the inflation fight has been. That makes it especially important that “we really stay the course” while keeping a close eye on any other emerging risks.“From my perspective, I have gained some confidence with the last three months,” Collins said on inflation. She added: “I think we’re not quite there yet.”Eric Rosengren, who ran the Boston Fed from 2007 to 2021, said it was too soon to know if the Fed will cut more than once — largely because of the presidential election. After September, the Fed’s remaining meetings for 2024 are the week of the election in November and then again in December. To avoid political backlash, the Fed would probably steer clear of a rate cut in November. But by December, the economy may be headed in different directions depending on who wins.“We have two candidates who have very different fiscal policies, and at least some of those fiscal policies could start changing the forecast,” Rosengren said. “So I think the committee probably is going to want to be pretty neutral on what they do after September.”"
WaPo_41,Grandparents feel ‘spied on’ through nanny cams when they babysit,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/31/meghan-leahy-nanny-cams-babysitting-grandparents/,2024-07-31 17:59:06.418004,,"Dear Meghan: We love looking after our 18-month-old granddaughter when her parents travel. She’s an easy child who generally follows a set schedule: Nap at 11, bedtime at 7, and snacks and meals at set times.The problem is her parents have nanny cams aimed at the crib and the living room. Because the child is on such a specific schedule, they tune in at meals and bedtime to check in. On one visit, I got a call 15 minutes after nap time was supposed to end, suggesting I wake her up or she wouldn’t sleep. In fact, she had woken up mid-nap, played quietly in her crib for 15 minutes and went back to sleep. I was getting ready to wake her based on the correct sleep time, rather than the time on the clock. On our last visit, we put her down right on time, but she didn’t fall asleep for over an hour, playing quietly in her crib. Mom called in distress, asking if the night light was too bright or the sound machine too loud.I hate that she can’t relax while away, and I really dislike feeling micromanaged and spied on. How do we navigate this? I find myself getting really frustrated and unable to relax and just enjoy being with our granddaughter because I feel like we are constantly being watched and found wanting. I have heard similar stories from friends who are grandparents.— WatchedWatched: From doorbell cameras to nanny cams, our culture is obsessed with monitoring all kinds of people (and animals). Since so many of us grew up with wildly different access, it is difficult to discern what is needed and what borders on neuroticism. For instance, do I begrudge a new parent checking the camera while their little one is in day care? Probably not. Is it necessary to stare at a crib camera while a healthy baby sleeps upstairs? Well, that’s a tougher call. Your issue with these young parents falls somewhere in the middle of these two examples.To begin, you sound utterly reasonable. I don’t hear any of the “I’m older and know everything and don’t need anyone checking on me” that I sometimes see from grandparents. In fact, you feel empathy for the mom who cannot relax, and I love to see that.You specifically mention that you watch the baby when the parents are traveling, so I’m curious how often this is. If, for instance, the parents travel twice a year, you may decide to suck it up and put up with the monitoring for the sake of spending time with your granddaughter. When you’ve mentally decided that mom will call day and night, you can just roll with it and decide to be unbothered.If the parents travel often or you feel bothered by this monitoring, you need to ask for a sit down with the parents. Clarify before you meet what you are seeking to accomplish with this meeting. It could be something like you want the parents to feel reassured, you want to feel a bit more trusted and you are looking for a middle ground between these two points. By reflecting on your own talking points, you are less likely to veer off into hurt feelings and petty examples.When you sit with the parents, lead with how much you value your granddaughter and them. Admit how different parenting was for your generation, that it would have been nice to have a way to “check in” sometimes and that you appreciate that this is how parenting is now. Then, say something like, “I know Octavia’s schedule is important, and I’m hoping we can set up some times to check in rather than on-the-spot calls. I find them to be a bit distracting, and I think it would help you to feel more relaxed on your much-deserved vacation/stressful work trip. What times work best for you? I’m happy to call or text updates.”Their reception depends on your relationship with these young parents, and you should use your knowledge of these dynamics to communicate best with them. For instance, if you know the birth was traumatic, you will acknowledge that it must be scary to leave her. If the couple experienced miscarriage, you will acknowledge how special this toddler is. If you know they experience anxiety, you will acknowledge that the imagination can run wild when you are away from your child. The more empathy you offer these parents, the more likely they are to feel seen, and the more seen they feel, the more likely they are to relax (and bug you less). You get the point: You want to work with what you have in front of you with love and understanding.Only you can decide how much you want to push back here. For what it’s worth, I too was a young parent who sometimes over-monitored my babies and only time, wisdom and experience helped me see that the monitoring just caused more anxiety. And yes, I’ve admitted this to my mother; she was always graciously accommodating of my peccadillos until I matured as a parent. Keep in mind that parents need time to grow up just as their children do. Whatever you do, stay in your granddaughter’s life! It’s a blessing for all of you."
WaPo_42,Nothing was going to stop the U.S. women’s gymnastics team this time,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/usa-gymnastics-gold-injuries/,2024-07-31 17:37:06.418004,,"PARIS — It took less than 10 minutes to construct the medal podium following the women’s gymnastics team finals. The Paris Olympics crew went to work on the floor, carrying slate-colored podiums made of wood and plastic. Five people worked together to bring in the top platform intended for the world’s best. When the structure was completed, workers wiped down the stage so that golden feet wouldn’t dare touch dust.What it took to assemble Team USA’s medal perch Tuesday night needed little effort and minimal time. Not at all reflective of the journeys for the women who would soon step on top of that platform — after extreme hardship — and shine.When the Americans outclassed all comers, scoring 171.296 points and soaring in front of a star-studded and sellout crowd that redecorated a Parisian arena in stars and stripes, Simone Biles was the first to receive a gold medal. Earlier in the day, she had spent some time with her therapist. She does this now — checking in on her mental state and freely sharing it with the world — ever since a vault in Tokyo ruined her last quest for gold. The story of Biles stepping away because of the “twisties” has been well documented over the past three years, but Jade Carey, the next gymnast to have gold draped around her neck, also has experienced that frightening feeling.There have been times when Carey has known exactly how to stick those difficult tumbling passes, yet her body wouldn’t cooperate. She has endured injuries that felt too difficult to manage. Her month leading into 2023 U.S. championships was “pretty challenging.” Then, after a trying year, still giving her all to a sport that takes so much out of its most devoted followers, Carey admitted to having thoughts of quitting.Sunisa Lee, the Olympic all-around champion in 2021, almost didn’t have a choice. Health issues nearly forced her into retirement. Last year, Lee was diagnosed with two kidney diseases. Lee had to step away from college gymnastics, and her career seemed to be in peril. But Tuesday night as teammate Jordan Chiles helped adjust the Paris medal ribbon around Lee’s neck, her comeback story to elite gymnastics could not have been scripted better — with the former champion beaming in gold again.“This team has definitely been through a lot,” Lee said. “It’s just different this time around than [in Tokyo].”These are the gymnasts responsible for earning the program’s fourth gold medal. They didn’t go the cheesy route and name themselves the “Comeback Kids.” They’re grown women — well, everyone except 16-year-old Hezly Rivera — and they’ve been through some stuff. So, when deciding on a team nickname, they went for something a bit more raw. A phrase that would show their heightened confidence and inform the world that they’re back.“F--- Around And Find Out.”Nothing stood in their way. No twisties. No illness. No thoughts of leaving the sport. Yet in the years leading up to Paris, who could have imagined this U.S. women’s gymnastics team would score a nearly six-point win over the closest competitors, when almost every one of these women needed to overcome an abundance of adversity?“In 2016, we were destined to win gold. Everybody already kind of said we would win gold, and so whenever we went out there, we did our job and we did win gold,” Biles said. “And it was just like, we were a little young and naive, so it didn’t hit the way that it does now. Now that I’m much older and we have so much more experience, we’re out here really having fun and enjoying what we’re doing.”The team began the night on the vault — that wretched apparatus that now causes fits of stress for anyone who cares about Biles. Chiles felt it. That “is it going to happen again?” dread. But in the morning, Biles had told her therapist that she was feeling calm and ready for everything, including the vault. The meet allowed just one attempt per gymnast, so Biles had one chance to stick her landing. She did, for a 14.900 score.“After I finished vault, I was relieved,” Biles said. “I was like, ‘Whew!’ Because, at least no flashbacks or anything.”There on the team sideline, Chiles was fangirling as hard as Serena Williams, Natalie Portman, Michael Phelps and Spike Lee.“Yo! Hallelujah! No flashbacks, no nothing!” Chiles said. “All she needs to do is do her normal, so me jumping up and down was just like a relief. And from there on, she’s the greatest of all greats, so I think it was kind of like, ‘Okay, we’re about to really do this and go out there and be us.’”After the relief came more joy. Even with two more rotations to go, Chiles, the leader in the clubhouse when it comes to having the most fun, was smiling and making a heart gesture to the camera that followed the team to the balance beam. By that time, clearly, the meet had turned into a race for who’s coming in second. The U.S. women led all teams with an 87.432 score, more than three points ahead of the Italians. Gold would not become official until Biles capped the night on the floor. However, instead of the Taylor Swift mix that plays during her floor routine, organizers should have had “The Star-Spangled Banner” queued up. They would soon need it for Team USA’s podium moment.“This means everything to me,” said Carey, who experienced a tough fall on the floor during the first day of competition. “I’m so honored to be on this team, to be able to contribute today. This week hasn’t exactly gone how I wanted it to, but I’m just grateful that I was able to compete tonight and get the job done.”The workers in the teal Paris Olympic polos quickly did their job in building the medal stand. And Biles, Carey, Chiles, Lee and Rivera did theirs better than anyone else in the world. It took time, perseverance and a ‘F--- Around and Find Out” kind of toughness for this team to return to the podium. And so, these women deserved to bask in their golden moment."
WaPo_43,Who killed Tyler Skaggs?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/tyler-skaggs-eric-kay-angels-fentanyl/,2024-07-31 17:29:06.418004,,"One spring day a decade ago, after another long day at the ballpark, Eric Kay finished work and headed to a nearby condo.Kay was a chummy, ubiquitous presence behind the scenes for the Los Angeles Angels, where he had spent virtually all of his adult life in the communications department. He had recently been named its director, Kay’s dream job.But over the previous several years, Kay had grown addicted to opioids, typically in the form of 10-milligram Norco pills. Now he was in Arizona for spring training and a planned pill shipment had fallen through. So Kay went looking for a source — and landed on a young pitcher recently traded to the team. His name: Tyler Skaggs.Kay said he arrived at the address Skaggs gave him to find the ballplayer and a buddy chopping up 30-milligram Percocet pills and snorting them. Kay had only ever swallowed pills before, he said. But he leaned in and inhaled.Kay later described this encounter to federal agents and The Washington Post — establishing the origin, or at least his version of it, of a years-long, drug-fueled relationship between two men that would spiral toward the darkest imaginable outcome.It has been five years since Skaggs, at age 27, was discovered dead in a hotel room in Texas with fentanyl in his system, rocking baseball and adding another celebrity casualty to a public health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousand of Americans, with no solution in sight.To the authorities and Skaggs’s family, Kay’s role in the ballplayer’s death was simple: Kay was a “pill pusher,” as a prosecutor put it, who used his big league access to prey on Skaggs and other players whose profession made them vulnerable to the allure of painkillers. In 2022, a Texas jury convicted Kay of giving Skaggs the fentanyl-laced pill that killed him. A judge sentenced him to 22 years in federal prison.But the story of Skaggs’s history with drugs, his relationship with Kay and his death is more complicated than what was presented at court and what has previously been reported, The Post found in a review of court and law enforcement materials.Those records include a key but elusive trove of evidence: a law enforcement scan of Skaggs’s phone, which includes thousands of text messages to and from Skaggs spanning at least seven years. The Post accessed the scan, which was filed in evidence, in a Texas courthouse last year.Prosecutors and Kay’s defense lawyers presented only a fraction of the messages related to Skaggs’s drug use, The Post found. Skaggs’s appellate lawyer, Brett Ordiway, said the exhibits he received from Kay’s trial did not include the full scan of Skaggs’s phone The Post reviewed.The records and interviews shed new light on Skaggs’s familiarity with powerful opioids years before he met Kay — procuring, using and even selling them. They also reveal how the criminal case against Kay dovetailed with the ongoing civil dispute between Skaggs’s family and the Angels, with prominent lawyers scrambling for leverage within weeks of Skaggs’ death.Kay, a 49-year-old father of three, will be in prison until 2041, barring a successful appeal. In phone interviews from a Colorado prison, he maintained that he did not give Skaggs any pills in Texas, a requirement for his conviction, but said he did give him pills before they left California. Kay told federal agents the same.In interviews, members of Skaggs’s family said they were sympathetic to the cost of Kay’s punishment on his own family. But they didn’t determine that punishment, they said; prosecutors, a jury and a judge did. “It’s not about the years,” Skaggs’s mother, Debbie Hetman, said of Kay’s prison sentence. “It’s just about the accountability.”The Skaggs family’s attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Kay’s culpability was “not even debatable anymore,” noting that Kay’s trial attorney had access to the same messages The Post reviewed, though he didn’t present them in court.In a statement, the U.S. attorney’s office in the Northern District of Texas, where Kay was convicted, suggested that scrutinizing Skaggs’s history with drugs before Kay was a form of “victim-blaming.”“Mr. Kay is paying an appropriate price for doling out deadly drugs,” the statement read.Kay, though, in interviews and in his legal defense, insisted Skaggs was the “driver” of their illicit relationship, directing him as a drug gopher and sending other players to him even as Kay buckled under his own addiction.And it started, he said, in that Arizona condo, where snorting the pills brought clarity and relief like he had never before known, and would spend the next several years chasing.WHEN SKAGGS LEFT HOME for pro ball in 2009, he was newly 18 and had only ever been away for one baseball tournament. His stepfather, Dan Ramos, recalled that he was “basically a kid going to play with men.” The family was nervous but confident he could handle it.Skaggs’s talent was a special case, not coaxed out through the travel-ball grind but perfected in his Los Angeles-area backyard, where he spent hours working on his curveball from a homemade mound. Skaggs played three sports at Santa Monica High, where his mom was the softball coach.At Skaggs’s memorial, his agent, Ryan Hamill, said he expected the kid to attend college, but Skaggs was adamant. “I want to be a first-rounder next year,” Hamill said Skaggs declared, referring to the MLB draft. “And I will do whatever you tell me to do to become one.”The Angels, Skaggs’s favorite team, took him in the first round and paid him a $1 million signing bonus.Years later, during Kay’s trial, prosecutors repeatedly stated that Kay was Skaggs’s “only source” for powerful opioids. Previously unreported text messages show that Skaggs used and traded in various opioid pills going back to his early years in pro baseball.In July 2012, Skaggs, who had been traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, was assigned to the Class AAA Reno Aces when a teammate asked whether he wanted to “swap” pills, text messages show.Skaggs responded that he could only hook up the teammate with one because he needed them for the team’s next stop.“OK I’ll swap you out on my Roxicets,” the teammate responded, the name for pills consisting of oxycodone and acetaminophen. Skaggs shared his hotel room number.“Can I mix the green and the blue?” the teammate texted later.“Yea of course,” Skaggs responded. “U should be fine just don’t drink alcohol.”Skaggs sometimes appeared to sell the pills, too. Around Christmas 2012, a college football player texted him: “Did you get those perks today[?]”“Yeah but I only got 10,” Skaggs responded.After the football player offered to buy them, Skaggs gave him a price — $10 each.The next month, the football player wanted more but balked at Skaggs’s price.“How about I give you 1 for free see how you like it,” Skaggs offered.“I already take em everyday I no how they feel,” the player responded.“I feel these are a little different,” Skaggs said before giving up on the sale.Other messages showed Skaggs’s persistence in seeking painkillers when his own supply ran dry, especially on days where he pitched.Before a start in Texas, Skaggs’s elbow and knee were bothering him. “Hurts like a mother f---er,” he texted.Skaggs wrote a friend on the opposing team. “I ran out of pain pills you know anyone with them,” he texted. “Plus I’m pitching today f--- me.“[J]ust need some pain killer nobody on your team does any[?]” Skaggs asked, adding: “otherwise my pitching today will be the worst you have ever seen.”The player promised to “do some investigating.” A half-hour later, Skaggs nudged him: “Anything?”Forty minutes after that: “Any word[?]”One way or another, Skaggs avoided the poor outing he had feared. “Thanks for asking around for the pills bruh,” Skaggs wrote that night, during which he pitched into the eighth inning with 10 strikeouts.The opposing player responded by complimenting his outing: “Guys said s--- was nasty.”Skaggs was promoted days later and struck out nine batters in six innings.LATE IN THE 2013 SEASON, when expanded rosters meant many prospects were called up, the Diamondbacks instead sent Skaggs, the team’s top-ranked prospect, home. There, he confided in Ramos, his stepfather, that he had a problem.They drove to the Little League field where Skaggs used to play, Ramos recalled, and Skaggs told him about the pressures of pro ball and playing through pain, with Percocets being “the helper that gets you through.”Skaggs’s family has said that they believed he completely kicked opioids in the weeks after that conversation. His stepbrother, Garet Ramos, testified that Skaggs provided Ramos with blue pills, which Ramos then meted out to Skaggs to wean him off the drugs. “You have been there for me when I went thru my addiction,” Skaggs later wrote his stepbrother.And his widow, Carli, whom he started dating that year, said that Skaggs only vaguely described his former dependency on painkillers as a “one-time thing.”But the demands to pitch through injuries only got worse, records show.Before the 2014 season, Skaggs was traded back to the Angels. He connected with Kay soon after, Skaggs’s phone records show. And after bonding over a shared interest in marijuana, Kay says, they found themselves in that condo snorting pills.Skaggs made the Angels’ rotation but suffered an elbow injury that required Tommy John surgery. He was still rehabbing in April 2016 when he messaged his Tommy John surgeon, Neal ElAttrache, that his arm was “tight and inflamed.”ElAttrache asked if the Angels’ staff had performed an ultrasound-guided injection, a treatment for pain and inflammation. “Are they paying any attention to you?” ElAttrache wrote, adding: “Don’t have a lot of comfort with whats going on there.”ElAttrache did not respond to requests for comment. The Angels declined to comment.Later that season, Skaggs’s agent, Hamill, railed against the Angels for diagnosing him with a shoulder impingement.“These guys are trying to f--- us,” Hamill wrote. Skaggs acknowledged that throwing “didn’t feel the greatest.”Hamill responded: “You didnt tell them that though right[?]”Those messages are among many, some of which The Post previously reported, in which Hamill urged Skaggs to pitch through pain. Hamill declined to comment.Skaggs turned to a familiar salve.In 2017, he messaged another Angels player, who was not among those named in the Kay case: “[A]nyway I can get one of those pain pills from you so I can take it during the game[?]”“No problem man,” the pitcher responded.Skaggs thanked him with a kissy face emoji.LIKE SKAGGS, ERIC KAY grew up in a Southern California family obsessed with sports.His father, Rick Kay, was a linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams. When Eric was born in 1974, then-UCLA football coach Dick Vermeil, a family friend, sent Eric’s parents a “letter-of-intent” for them to sign, he wrote, “so I won’t have any problem 17 years from today.""But a career in sports wasn’t all Kay inherited.Rick Kay suffered from addictions to amphetamines and painkillers developed during his career in pro football, Eric’s mother, Sandra, said. When Eric graduated from high school, his grandfather wrote him a letter detailing a lineage of drug and alcohol abusers in his family.“Please Eric, stay away from this stuff,” the grandfather pleaded.Kay started as an intern with the Angels in 1996. His father died in a car crash two years later, which Kay said began a battle with depression from which he found relief in opioids. Prescription records filed in court show that by at least 2009, one of Kay’s sources for opioids was the Angels’ team doctor.Between 2009 and 2013, the records show, Craig Milhouse, who has been the Angels’ physician for decades, prescribed Kay a total of 600 pills containing hydrocodone. For several months in 2012 and 2013, Kay’s prescriptions from Milhouse equated to two 10-milligram pills a day.The records do not state the medical reason given for the prescriptions. Kay said that he would approach Milhouse whenever he couldn’t get pills otherwise, typically with a lie about back or tooth pain.Milhouse and the Angels declined to comment, citing health privacy laws.Kay told federal agents that he entered an outpatient drug treatment program for the first time in 2013 but later returned to using drugs. By then, Kay was communications director, a demanding role coordinating players’ media needs. Members of a baseball staff work 14 hours a day, travel half the season and are sometimes treated like glorified butlers by players demanding dinner reservations, tee times and NBA tickets.But Kay said there was none of that with Skaggs, whom he described as an approachable hometown star eager to do his part. On the surface, their relationship was mostly professional and friendly. Kay was commissioner of the Angels’ fantasy football league. He named his team after an insult Skaggs lobbed at him during some league banter: “Pig T---,” a crude reference to women’s breasts and Kay’s weight.But after the episode at that Arizona condo, a new dynamic emerged between Kay and Skaggs.Skaggs pointed at least five Angels players to Kay to obtain pills, later court testimony and records show. One of those pitchers, Blake Parker, told federal agents that Kay seemed reluctant but that “the guys kept getting on him and asking him to get pills,” court records show.“Tyler volunteered me to these guys, like, ‘Hey, Eric’s an addict, he always has pills,’ which wasn’t the case,” Kay told The Post. “I didn’t have a steady flow; that was part of the nightmare of the addiction.”Kay said he made several failed attempts to get clean. Kay was prescribed Suboxone, a medication designed to coax users off opioids, starting in 2015 and was on and off it for the next several years. But Skaggs didn’t see Kay’s struggle as a barrier to bugging him about pills, records show.In July 2018, a period during which prescription records show Kay was on Suboxone, first baseman C.J. Cron messaged Skaggs, asking him to get as many “blues” from Kay as he could.“Lol he is off them,” Skaggs responded, adding: “text him.”“Nah I won’t text him haha,” Cron replied. (Cron declined to comment.)In April 2019, Kay’s drug abuse came to a head at Angel Stadium after he took too many pills. The Angels’ traveling secretary, Tom Taylor, later testified that he observed Kay sweating profusely and offered to drive behind him home. Then he found Kay “dancing” in a pharmacy along the route.Kay was ultimately hospitalized with an overdose doctors said could have easily killed him. A video reviewed by The Post shows a sweaty and twitchy Kay in a hospital bed, rambling incoherently.What the Angels learned during that episode is in dispute, and central to the Skaggs family’s insistence that the team was responsible for the pitcher’s death.Tim Mead, the Angels’ vice president of communications, and Taylor arrived at the hospital, where Kay’s mom and then-wife were tending to him. According to Kay’s mom, Sandra, Mead viewed text messages showing drug dealers attempting to meet Kay at the stadium. Then, Sandra Kay said, she suggested that Mead look into Skaggs.In an affidavit prepared at the request of Angels lawyers, Sandra Kay later said she did “not know whether Tim heard me.” But she told The Post she believed Mead heard her and just didn’t respond.“I said to myself: ‘Tim already knows,’” Sandra Kay said. She said the affidavit appeared to be an “abbreviated” version of what she told the Angels.Eric Kay has also claimed he warned the Angels about Skaggs’s drug use. According to Drug Enforcement Administration interview reports, Kay told federal agents that he alerted Mead in 2017, calling Skaggs “a problem.” Mead never followed up, Kay said. He also told the feds that during his overdose two years later, pills spilled out of his pocket and he told Taylor, “Those are for Tyler Skaggs.”Mead and Taylor declined to comment. In a statement, the Angels reiterated that the team ""has stated from the beginning that prior to Tyler’s tragic death, no one in management was aware, or informed, of any employee providing opioids to any player, nor that Tyler was using opioids.”Two weeks after Kay’s overdose, Mead announced he was leaving the Angels for an executive position at the Baseball Hall of Fame, a job he has since resigned. Kay was in outpatient treatment when he learned he was now the most senior employee in his department.After his overdose, Kay started a new round of Suboxone, prescription records show. Then he returned to work. A six-game trip to Texas that summer would be Kay’s first time back on the road.ON JUNE 30, 2019, the last day of the homestand, Kay texted Skaggs: “Hoe many?”""Just a few like 5,” Skaggs responded.After the game, the Angels flew to Texas, dressed in joke cowboy outfits for the trip. Skaggs played cards, drank and, on the team bus after they landed, hammed it up on a microphone.After the team got to the hotel, Skaggs texted Kay his room number. “Come by,” he wrote.“K,” Kay responded.The next afternoon, Skaggs wasn’t responding to texts or calls. An Angels security official opened the door to Skaggs’s room. The first thing he saw was his cowboy boots hanging off the end of the bed.Skaggs was facedown in a small puddle of blood that had poured from his nose on the otherwise neat bed. White powder residue was on a desk and iPad, alongside a hollowed-out pen. And in Skaggs’s backpack nearby, investigators found one blue pill marked “M/30” and five pink pills marked “K/56.”A later laboratory test on one of the pink pills showed it was an authentic pharmaceutical pill containing oxycodone. The blue one was an illicit pill of the sort flooding into the United States from Mexico and elsewhere. It contained no active ingredient but fentanyl, the substance 50 times more powerful than heroin.With Skaggs’s body on the way to the morgue, Kay shuffled along with the rest of the stunned Angels team and staff into a banquet room in the hotel lobby, where detectives waited to interview them.Kay spoke softly, a police tape recorder barely picking up his voice, as Southlake, Tex., detectives asked him the same questions they had for everybody.He had last seen Skaggs in the lobby when everybody got their hotel keys, Kay lied. And when police asked if he knew Skaggs to ever use drugs, he lied again: “Marijuana, yeah, I don’t really, I don’t know. Like anybody else, I’m sure.”Kay has since said he was still in PR mode, attempting to protect Skaggs, his longtime employer and, in the process, himself.In the weeks after Skaggs’s death, records show, jostling for information began between the grieving family and the Angels organization, which found itself in the center of the investigation.The team retained attorney John Cayce Jr., a former Texas judge, and he dropped a bombshell. Over breakfast with the Southlake police chief, a recorded conversation shows, he pointed investigators toward Kay, who had admitted to an Angels colleague that he visited Skaggs’s hotel room the night he died.Cayce then asked the lead detective to coordinate all interviews with Angels employees through him, and insisted that the team was confounded by the circumstances of Skaggs’s death. “Tyler had no history of drug use,” Cayce told the detective, according to a recording of their phone call. “Basically all the team management, all they knew was what was being reported in the newspapers.”Investigators quickly learned that Skaggs had been intoxicated when he died. An autopsy revealed that he had oxycodone and fentanyl in his system as well as a blood alcohol level of 0.122, more than 1½ times the legal limit for driving.What killed him was more complicated, Marc Krouse, the former Tarrant County deputy medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, told The Post.Krouse said he had an unusual amount of interaction with the Skaggs family — and especially with his mother-in-law, Nina Miles, who Krouse said urged him to rule the death a homicide. “My impression is she was trying to protect her daughter. The poor girl was wrecked,” Krouse said. Miles did not respond to requests for comment.When Krouse’s office released the autopsy report that August, he said, it did the family a favor by waiting until a Friday afternoon, when news readership is low.He found that the death was accidental, with the cause being intoxication from both drugs and the alcohol as well as Skaggs’s lungs being filled with vomit. In interviews, Krouse said his finding from the beginning was that he could not with “scientific and medical honesty” say that Skaggs would not have died if it weren’t for the fentanyl. He added that the concentration of fentanyl, 3.8 nanograms per milliliter, was relatively small for a lethal case.Independent experts who reviewed Skaggs’s autopsy and toxicology findings at The Post’s request were divided on whether they agreed with Krouse.Ashraf Mozayani, a forensic toxicologist and professor at Texas Southern University, said that, like Krouse, she would not have found that Skaggs would have survived if it weren’t for the fentanyl.“Fentanyl is the strongest, very strong opioid compared with oxycodone — that we know. But add the ethanol to that, it might be ethanol that was the cause of death,” said Mozayani, using the medical term for alcohol. “You can’t tell which one was it really — not that easily.”Bruce A. Goldberger, a forensic toxicologist and professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine, said that the fentanyl concentration in Skaggs’s system was “not very high” but that it was “notable” when combined with the other substances. Unlike Mozayani, Goldberger said that in his opinion there was “sufficient evidence” to support that Skaggs would not have died if it weren’t for the fentanyl.Peter Davidson, an associate professor in medicine at the University of California San Diego who has studied tens of thousands of overdoses, said that fentanyl could have been the “icing on the cake” in Skaggs’s system but the amount he ingested “is not going to kill anyone who’s not a small child or has ... some other major health issues going on."" Davidson said that the amount of oxycodone, 38 nanograms per milliliter, and alcohol in Skaggs’s system was “not anomalous” for a lethal overdose, even without the fentanyl.An uncertain cause of death complicated a potential case against Kay, which would require prosecutors to prove a “but-for” cause, meaning Skaggs wouldn’t have died but for the fentanyl.Pitcher Matt Harvey, Skaggs’s teammate, later admitted after being given legal immunity that a few days before the Texas road trip he gave Skaggs several pills marked “K56” containing oxycodone, which was what investigators found in his backpack and his toxicology report. (Harvey declined to comment.)Investigators were under pressure. The Skaggs family hired a civil attorney, Houston-based Hardin, who has represented sports stars including the NFL’s Deshaun Watson and MLB’s Roger Clemens. And after the release of the autopsy findings, the family said in a statement that the presence of drugs in Skaggs’s system was “completely out of character” and revealed for the first time that the investigation involved an unnamed Angels employee.“We will not rest until we learn the truth about how Tyler came into possession of these narcotics, including who supplied them,” the statement read.In a phone call shortly afterward, Southlake detective Delaney Green told the mother-in-law, Miles, that the unexpected statement jeopardized police’s chances at interviewing Kay. She also complained about investigators from Hardin’s office showing up at the police department seeking records.“In a sense it has affected our investigation,” Green said, according to a recording.The case was at a crossroads, Green said, but law enforcement officials would soon “decide whether or not we can go forward.”“Decide to go forward!” Miles yelled. “Do it!”In August 2020, federal prosecutors indicted Kay on charges of drug conspiracy and distribution of a controlled substance resulting in death. The latter count, enacted in the wake of the 1986 overdose death of NBA prospect Len Bias, carries a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 20 years upon conviction. Though records show prosecutors had the identity of the person they believe sold Kay the fentanyl pill, they have not been charged.Leo Beletsky, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University who has studied the prosecution of overdoses as homicides, said the purpose of such cases is “performative. ... They help policymakers, prosecutors, other folks, to signal to their constituents that they’re doing something about the crisis while actually likely making it worse.”Prosecutors offered Kay a deal the following year. If he pleaded guilty, the government would agree to a sentence between seven and 10 years, according to notes summarizing the offer. Kay could be out of prison in five.But Kay’s attorney, California-based Michael Molfetta, said in a recorded conversation that if Kay decided “to plead to this horses--- deal, I will not go to Texas. I will not be party to it.”That would have left Kay to navigate sentencing with his secondary lawyer, William Reagan Wynn, who by the end of the case had gone absent, court testimony shows, and would later be suspended from the Texas bar due to misconduct in an unrelated matter. (Wynn did not respond to requests for comment.)In an interview, Molfetta said he ultimately gave Kay a “great defense,” regardless of the outcome. “I was warned by my friends: ‘Don’t go to Texas and try a case,’” Molfetta said. “I didn’t listen.”During his meeting with Kay in which he advised him to turn down the deal, Molfetta insisted prosecutors had overplayed their hand.“They played it stupid, and I plan on f---ing them for their stupidity,” Molfetta said. “The only way you get convicted, son ... is if 12 f---ing Texans decide they are going to ignore their oath, ignore the law and f--- you. And why would they?”Kay went to trial. Prosecutors introduced a sensational parade of big leaguers who testified that Kay gave them pills. And they sidestepped Krouse’s unwillingness to isolate fentanyl as the substance responsible for Skaggs’s death, calling two experts who did.One, Richard Fries, was a Tarrant County deputy medical examiner who didn’t work on Skaggs’s autopsy. In an interview, Krouse, who has since been fired as part of an officewide scandal highlighting allegedly botched autopsies and false testimony, claimed that Fries dissented from him due to office politics.“The time for him to have brought that up was during the case review, not two years later,” Krouse said of Fries believing fentanyl killed Skaggs. Fries, and the Tarrant County Medical Examiner’s Office, did not respond to a request for comment.The other expert, emergency medicine physician and medical toxicologist Stacey Hail, frequently testifies for the Department of Justice on “but-for” causes in overdose cases. Hail testified that her $700 hourly rate didn’t affect her analysis.In an interview, Hail said the amount of fentanyl detected in Skaggs’s system “does not matter” because such levels are not reliable, and that Skaggs and his teammates were not taking enough oxycodone to overdose. “They were using oxycodone not because they were addicted to it [or] because they were getting high, but they were trying to take the edge off of their pain to play baseball,” Hail said.Molfetta didn’t present in court the messages from Skaggs’s phone shedding light on his drug use unrelated to Kay, and he recently downplayed the phone’s evidentiary value. “Whatever was on Tyler Skaggs’s phone, I knew this: Eric Kay was on there too,” Molfetta said.The jurors found Kay guilty. It took them less than an hour and a half.BEFORE LEAVING CALIFORNIA for Texas to stand trial two years ago, Kay hugged his youngest son, who was 11. He hasn’t seen him since. Kay describes that hug as the most wrenching moment of his life other than the death of his father.“Those three kids is all that’s keeping me going and upright,” Kay said of his sons, the oldest of whom is 24.Kay spends his workdays now in front of a sewing machine making work gloves for a quarter an hour. His arms are covered in jailhouse tattoos: his dad’s jersey number, his kids’ birthdays in Roman numerals, the phrase “rescue me from me,” a Smashing Pumpkins lyric.He started to collect the ink once the realization set in that he will never regain his old life. That he still has any life at all, Kay believes, is thanks to Tyler Skaggs.Kay checked into rehab following Skaggs’s death, and says he has remained sober with the help of Suboxone. “I’m an idiot, an absolute fool, if I can’t look at that moment and grow from it,” Kay said of Skaggs’s death and what has unfolded since.Last November, an appellate court rejected Kay’s argument that prosecutors didn’t prove their case. Though he is planning further challenges, the odds of him overturning his conviction are long.But he may have one upcoming reprieve from his prison routine.The Skaggs’s wrongful death suit against the Angels, filed in 2021, is finally scheduled to go to trial next year, and the Kays are, as Skaggs family attorney Hardin puts it, “potentially helpful witnesses.” Hardin confirmed that his office recently contacted the Kays, asking if they would be willing to speak informally before depositions begin.Hardin said that even though they could use the Kays’ help, the Skaggs family and the Kays are “still on the opposite sides of this.”“They want the Angels to be found responsible for what happened, just like Kay is,” Hardin said. “They’re both responsible.”Jack Douglas contributed to this report"

Here’s what to know about the longtime leader of Hamas’s political wing, whose operations — including oversight of the group’s finances — were conducted from the Qatari capital of Doha.Haniyeh led Hamas’s 15-member political bureau since 2017, the pinnacle of his long career with the group. He was first appointed assistant to Hamas’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in 1997.
Yehiya Sinwar, the group’s leader in Gaza, and its military chief, Mohammed Deif — who was targeted in an Israeli strike earlier this month — prefer to stay in the shadows, so Haniyeh has in recent years been the public face of Hamas, traveling to meet with foreign leaders. He had lived in Qatar since 2020, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
Yassin and Haniyeh were both injured in an Israeli strike on Gaza City in 2003. The following year Israel killed Yassin and Hamas’s next leader in quick succession, leaving Haniyeh to join a new collective leadership.
While Hamas historically boycotted elections, Haniyeh supported the party’s participation in the 2006 legislative elections. Hamas, led by Haniyeh, went on to win the elections amid widespread frustration with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, dominated by rival party Fatah.
Haniyeh served as Palestinian Authority prime minister in a brief unity government that followed; however, in 2007, Hamas ousted the Palestinian Authority in a short civil war and seized control of Gaza. The Palestinian Authority maintains control of parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Neither group has held democratic elections in the years since.
Haniyeh led Hamas within Gaza until 2017, when he was promoted to political leader of the larger organization (which has branches for Gaza, the West Bank, the diaspora and among Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons.)

WaPo_45,Hundreds of ‘Harris for President’ golf carts roll through Trump stronghold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/the-villages-florida-kamala-harris/,2024-07-31 17:00:06.418004,,"The scene in the Florida parking lot shocked even those who planned it.Hundreds of golf carts filed in Saturday, decked out in American flags; “Harris for President” posters; and red, white and blue streamers. Their drivers cheered, honked their horns and rode around town for hours, supporting Vice President Harris’s presidential bid for a parade in The Villages, a Florida retirement community that has been a stronghold for former president Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement for nearly a decade.And it still is. The latest voter registration numbers for Sumter County, where The Villages is primarily located, show Democrats outnumbered three to one. In the 2020 election, Trump took 68 percent of the county’s votes.But on Saturday, the Trump-loving town saw a turnout for a Harris rally that shocked organizers and paradegoers alike. It probably marked the largest golf cart caravan for a Democratic candidate in nearly a decade, said Dennis Foley, vice president of the Villages Democratic Club, which helped throw the event. The club expected to see around 250 people, but the attendance was at least double that. The unexpected show of support drew millions of views online.President Biden’s exit from the race and swift endorsement of Harris stoked a fire in the community, where Democrats are often tight-lipped about their affiliation.“There’s enthusiasm for Kamala and also a sense of significance to this election and that there’s a lot at stake,” Foley said. “So the combination, I think, has boosted everyone that was a little bit depressed.”The rally was followed by a quick counter from Trump supporters in The Villages.On Sunday, the Villages MAGA Club — which markets itself as a group for residents who “support the America first agenda to protect and preserve our great nation” — announced it would host a golf cart caravan to support the Trump-Vance ticket.The club said in a Facebook post on Monday that the local sheriff’s office would attend the rally, writing: “We will kick out anyone who causes trouble. It’s what we expect from the democrats.”H. Gary Morse, a Republican Party megadonor, developed The Villages into a routine stop for GOP political figures, including Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis. After Florida flipped from a battleground to a Republican bastion, The Villages made national headlines for contentious rallies in support of the then-president.Going into the 2024 presidential race, the Republican side of the aisle remains “very firm” in The Villages, Foley said.“There’s nothing we can say or do that will convince them,” he said.The shift has been within the community’s Democrats, who are starting to make an appearance larger and louder than those of the past two election cycles, when the energy of the GOP faithful dominated the town.“I think it’s just such a stronghold here that people don’t come out to speak up and say, ‘Hey, you know, I’m voting for someone other than Trump.’ And so this was an opportunity,” said resident Diane Ruggiero.Ruggiero, a registered Republican, said she has never voted for Trump, but she sees reminders of her neighbors’ support for him every day in The Villages. Trump 2024 flags hang in front yards, and bumper stickers are slapped on golf carts, the main mode of transportation in the community.When she saw information about the rally for Harris on a local news site Saturday morning, she wanted to attend to support Harris’s candidacy.Hours later, Ruggiero; her husband, Jim Guy; and their dog, Skipper were driving in the parade, their golf cart adorned with a white “Harris for President” poster. Ruggiero wore a “Dog Mama for Kamala” pin that she’d been given at the rally. Others held handmade signs that read “I’m a cat lady,” a reference to comments made by Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate when he derided Harris and other prominent Democrats as “childless cat ladies” in 2021. A few wore orange jumpsuits, alluding to Trump being found guilty in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment in 2016.As the golf carts made their way around the town square in The Villages, they were met with about a dozen Trump supporters who stood in a counterprotest, holding signs supporting Trump.Among them were Tommy and Valerie Jamieson, who started The Villages MAGA Club together in 2022.The couple said they’d read about the rally online and had already been in the area of the parade route for one of their own events. During the Harris rally, Tommy Jamieson said they stood peacefully with their signs.“This was kind of like, ‘Okay, what in the world is going on?’” he said. “Democrats having a golf cart rally, it’s just come out of nowhere.”After the rally, Jamieson said the club was “swamped” with calls to hold a rally supporting Trump, which they’ve scheduled for Saturday, adding that he expected it to be “one of the biggest rallies ever held here in The Villages.”The back-and-forth rallies reflect a political divide that seems poised to become more pronounced in The Villages as its Democrats come out of the woodwork, re-energized by Harris’s entry to the race.“We are fired up to fight off the Trump-Vance ticket,” Foley said.The way Ruggiero sees it, Harris’s candidacy has given once-quiet left-leaners in The Villages new momentum.“I could see that energy that now people are like ‘Oh, I’m not one out of 100. I might be one out of 10, maybe two out of 10,” she said."

WaPo_48,Our data isn’t safe. Resist giving it up whenever you can.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/31/data-breach-resistance/,2024-07-31 18:59:02.680627,,"Face the truth: We’ve lost the battle to protect our personal information.The latest high-profile data breach involving AT&T is yet another reminder we are at war with cybercriminals.The telecom reported that hackers had obtained call and text records of almost all of its wireless customers, compromising about 110 million accounts.Though the stolen data did not contain the content of those communications or expose personal information such as Social Security numbers or dates of birth, the breach still added to the volume of data collected on consumers.According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, there were 3,205 data compromises last year involving more than 353 million victims, a record high in the United States, a 78 percent increase over 2022.Because the digital attacks have left me feeling vulnerable, I’ve increased my efforts to limit their potential damage.Whenever possible, push back when companies ask for information they don’t actually need.Once, as I was picking up some furniture, the clerk wanted to take my driver’s license and scan a copy into the retailer’s computer system.“No, sir,” I said.He insisted the information was needed to keep a record of the items that were picked up by customers. Nonsense. I had a receipt. But I was okay with him verifying my identity by eyeballing my license.There was a long line of customers behind me, visibly annoyed — blowing their breath, rolling their eyes. I told the employee, loudly enough for them to hear, that the store’s policy was unnecessary and that it could expose me to identity theft should their system be hacked. Every piece of information that is compromised helps criminals improve their tactics in targeting victims.I gave the clerk two choices: Give me my order or issue a refund.He begrudgingly retrieved my purchased items.One small victory for data protection. But it’s an ongoing struggle.Here’s what happened to me recently.My husband and I are going to Cambodia and Vietnam next year. After looking up regional carriers, we settled on Qatar Airways and I decided to sign up for its loyalty program. It’s likely we will take future trips to cities the carrier serves. As part of the sign-up process, I was required to provide birthday information. However, I mistakenly reversed the numbers for month and day. Spotting my error minutes after registering, I tried to correct my profile, but Qatar’s system wouldn’t allow it.I couldn’t get help on the airline’s site, so I sent a message via X to @qatarsupport, which promised 24/7 customer support.In a direct message, I was instructed that I would have to upload two identification documents, such as a passport, birth certificate, or driver’s license.Wait, what?I didn’t have to provide documentation when setting up the account.Immediately, I became concerned. How many people have access to the data? Where is it stored? How secure is Qatar’s system?After several attempts, I couldn’t get direct answers from Qatar through an emailed media request, so I reviewed its privacy notice.The airline writes it “has taken adequate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data.”Then, it promised that to prevent unauthorized access, it has “put in place physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard” my data.This assurance did not comfort me after reading the following caveat: “Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to our Website or Mobile Apps via the Internet or similar connection.”Our data is not safe.In 2013, Target’s computer system was breached, allowing criminals to access to steal credit and debit card information from as many as 40 million consumers. An additional 70 million customers had their names, phone numbers, and email addresses compromised.This incident affected my personal information.Almost seven years ago, Equifax announced a massive breach had exposed the personal information of approximately 147 million people. At the time, the company said hackers exploited a “website application vulnerability.” People’s names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some instances, driver’s license numbers, credit card numbers, and other personal information were stolen, putting millions of folks at risk of identity theft and other fraudulent activity.Equifax notified me that my data was compromised.Every time there’s a data breach, the companies involved tell their customers that they deeply regret the inconvenience it might cause. They pledge to enhance security procedures. However, gaps in data protection continue to lead to stolen data. And, to be fair to the companies, con artists and hackers work full time, sometimes with the help of foreign governments, to outsmart corporate security systems.So, I will not be uploading my driver’s license, birth certificate or passport to Qatar’s website for its travel rewards program. I found a workaround.I deleted the one account with the wrong information and created a new one.I know I cannot win in the race to protect my data. It has been repeatedly exposed.But every act of defiance, however small, is worth a victory lap.Resistance isn’t always futile."

WaPo_50,"After scaring the U.S., South Sudan basketball eyes ambitions beyond Paris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/south-sudan-basketball-team-usa-paris-olympics/,2024-07-31 18:30:02.680627,,"South Sudan men’s basketball standout Khaman Maluach entered the Paris Olympics without expectations. But he and his team want to make an impression.“I wouldn’t say expectations, I would say standards,” Maluach said of his team’s approach. “All of us are going to give it our best and make noise and let the world know that we’re here.”The young East African nation introduced itself July 20, a week before basketball started in Paris. The team led the United States, favorites to win its fifth straight Olympic gold medal, by as many as 16 points in an exhibition match. The Bright Stars held a late lead before LeBron James’s driving layup with eight seconds left rescued the Americans.The result sparked concern from some American critics, and an outpouring of pride from the losing side, whose country became independent in 2011 following a 22-year civil war. Just 13 years after the country gained independence, the men’s basketball team will be its first in any sport to compete in the Olympics.“We don’t have any indoor basketball courts in our country, we don’t have anything like that,” South Sudan forward Wenyen Gabriel told reporters after the game. “We’re a bunch of refugees that came together for a few weeks out of the year that [are] over here trying our best, playing against some of the best players ever. This is much bigger than basketball for us.”Wenyen Gabriel with the proudest of words after South Sudan’s first-ever game against USA Basketball 🇸🇸 pic.twitter.com/NJYze9et4hCentral to South Sudan basketball’s story is Luol Deng, the former Chicago Bulls standout who now serves as president of the South Sudanese Basketball Federation.Since the 1950s, Sudan has experienced ongoing civil wars, and the country eventually split in 2011 when South Sudan became independent. Deng was born in the southern region of Sudan before that split, but his family later sought refuge in Egypt and was granted political asylum in England. He eventually moved to the United States, where he became a high school basketball star in New Jersey.A two-time all-star, Deng played 15 NBA seasons and represented the United Kingdom internationally before his retirement in 2019. Later that year, he became South Sudan Basketball Federation president and in 2020 he doubled as head coach of its men’s senior team.The program lacked facilities, funding and infrastructure, but Deng felt South Sudan had potential to become a force on the African continent, so he largely financed the operation.“I had to pay myself,” Deng told Sports Illustrated. “A lot of people didn’t see what the point was. They didn’t see the vision of it. Changing people’s mind on how things have been done in the past and making people believe that this could be something special was difficult. To be honest, most of the people I spoke with didn’t see how this was a good thing to get into.”During South Sudan’s struggle for independence and a subsequent civil war from 2013 to 2020, many people sought refuge beyond its borders. As a result, a generation of South Sudanese people grew up outside the country. Part of Deng’s challenge has been persuading those players to represent their nascent — if not unfamiliar — homeland instead of the countries to which their families fled. In other cases, South Sudan has had challenges obtaining FIBA clearance for those players to represent the country.The team is playing in Paris without big men Bol Bol, Thon Maker, Ater Majok and Jo Lual-Acuil because of “personal reasons” or an inability to gain clearance from FIBA. Majok can’t play because he represented Lebanon before South Sudan gained independence; Maker, who previously played for Australia, recently was ruled ineligible.Still, the Olympic roster includes former NBA players and stars from the Basketball Africa League.Gabriel was born in Sudan but his family relocated to Egypt and he later moved to New Hampshire. He played at Kentucky, spent five seasons in the NBA and currently plays for Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv.Guard Carlik Jones was born in Cincinnati to Sudanese parents. He won G League player of the year in 2023 while on a contract with the Chicago Bulls and spent last season with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls in China.Forward Nuni Omot was born in a refugee camp in Kenya and later moved to Minnesota. Forward JT Thor was born in Nebraska to South Sudanese parents. Other players such as Ottawa-born Marial Shayok come from families that moved to Australia or Canada.The 17-year-old Maluach is considered to have the most upside of the group. The 7-foot-2 center was born in what is now South Sudan and grew up in neighboring Uganda, where he started playing basketball at 13. Ahead of his freshman season at Duke, Maluach is a projected lottery pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.“I was so excited,” Maluach said of the first time he was called up to the national team at age 16. “I couldn’t wait just to put the jersey on and get on the floor and warm up with my teammates. And then having ‘South Sudan’ in front [on my jersey] gave me a lot of joy.”When Deng first moved to the United States in 1999, he enrolled at Blair Academy in Blairstown, N.J., and quickly became friends with Royal Ivey. The New York-born guard gave Deng his first pair of basketball sneakers and his family hosted Deng during holidays.More than two decades later, Ivey had closed a 10-year NBA career and was looking for greater coaching experience after he began as an assistant for the Oklahoma City Thunder’s G League affiliate in 2014. Ivey was an assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets in late 2020 when he saw Deng coaching South Sudan in clips on Instagram. He said he reached out to his old friend offering to help as an assistant for the national team if needed. Deng eventually circled back to offer him the head coaching job.“I just had a hunger to challenge myself. I didn’t know I was going to be the head coach,” Ivey said. “I just wanted to get the experience to be a part of a national team and do something different. Next thing you know, I’m in Kigali the following year coaching in AfroBasket.”South Sudan had played well enough to qualify for the continental tournament held in Rwanda’s capital in 2021. The next step was the FIBA World Cup, and if the team performed well there, the world’s youngest nation could punch a ticket to Paris.But first, Ivey said, he and his players had much to learn.“At first I had to learn the culture, learn what they’ve been through, what their families have been through being refugees, fleeing, leaving the country,” Ivey said. “I’m from New York City. I was raised in Harlem during the early ’90s during the crack epidemic and I thought I had it rough, but that’s nothing compared to what these guys have been through.“It’s very humbling. I’m getting more out of this experience than anything I’ve ever done in basketball as a player in the NBA. This has been eye-opening and life-changing for me.”The NBA veteran said he first spent a lot of time reviewing the fundamentals for players who lacked the same foundation as those who may have developed stateside. Since then, he said the team has quickly evolved.“It’s been night and day,” Ivey said of the team’s development from 2021 to now. “I remember coming in to the team and I was like, ‘How am I going to do this? Like, these guys?’ We couldn’t get through drills at certain points in time because they just never were exposed to certain kinds of drills and the fundamentals of the game. So I had to break it down and we built it up.”South Sudan made its first appearance in AfroBasket at the 2021 tournament in Rwanda, where it advanced to the quarterfinals, but lost to eventual champion Tunisia.Two years later, the country made its major international basketball tournament debut at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, where it clinched the nation’s first Olympic berth as the highest-finishing African team in the tournament. The decisive moment came after the team defeated Angola, but needed New Zealand to top Egypt. Several minutes remained in that game, so the team set up televisions in its locker room to watch the conclusion.“We watched about three to four minutes and as soon as the buzzer sounded, it was pure celebration,” Ivey said of Egypt’s loss. “Guys were crying, guys were hugging each other, we were dancing, playing music. It was a joyous moment for everybody in that room and it was a joyous moment for the country to qualify for the Olympics.”Maluach feels South Sudan has grown most on defense in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics. He said playing teams such as Serbia during the World Cup prepared them for a high level of competition.That improvement was evident during the exhibition against the United States, in which Jones registered a triple-double with 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Shayok added 24 points, and Thor buried a three-pointer to give South Sudan a 100-99 lead with 20 seconds to play.In Paris, they’ll meet again. South Sudan opened Group C play with a win over Puerto Rico. Its rematch against the United States comes on July 31, and it closes group play Aug. 3 against Serbia.Ivey echoed the notion that South Sudan enters the Olympics without expectations. But that doesn’t mean he and Deng don’t harbor lofty ambitions.“I want to see this thing grow exponentially,” Ivey said of South Sudan’s basketball program. “Before, Angola was a powerhouse, then you had Nigeria, then you had Tunisia. We want to be a powerhouse in Africa and this is the first step.”"
WaPo_51,Salt Lake City’s Olympics scandal changed the Games forever,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/31/olympic-scandal-salt-lake-city/,2024-07-31 18:30:02.680627,,"There was nearly two feet of snow and ice outside the KTVX-TV station in Salt Lake City on Nov. 24, 1998 — proof that Olympic officials had chosen a winter wonderland to host the 2002 Games.At 10 p.m. reporter Chris Vanocur sat inside the studio live on air and held up a piece of paper that would light a fire under that selection: It showed that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) may have been accepting bribes from Utah officials.The news leaped from Utah’s capital city around the world and landed 5,300 miles away, at IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.Salt Lake City officials reportedly spent money on lavish trips to Utah, paid children’s’ tuitions and covered medical costs, all for IOC members whose responsibilities included voting on the sites of future games.Vanocur’s report set off the largest bribery scandal in the history of the Olympics. Ten IOC members stepped down as a result, and the Justice Department indicted two local Olympic officials. The incident led Olympics officials to look back, uncovering bribery scandals in previous Olympiads. The IOC instituted more stringent ethics rules to avoid future issues, and the Salt Lake City bid’s recovery helped launch Mitt Romney’s political career.Now, the site of the most embarrassing Olympic bribery scandal will host the 2034 games.Vanocur’s bombshell report in 1998 tainted excitement for the city’s 2002 Olympic bid. About two weeks later, Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank Joklik acknowledged $400,000 in scholarships provided to relatives of IOC members between 1991 and 1995, when the city won its bid.About a week later, Marc Hodler — a Swiss member of the IOC since 1963 — detailed the vote-buying process. He told reporters that corruption had dated to at least Atlanta’s bid for the 1996 Games.He said bid cities bought blocs of IOC members’ votes for $3 million to $5 million, The Washington Post reported at the time.The seeds of this scandal were sown June 15, 1991 — the day the 1998 games were awarded to Nagano, Japan. Nagano beat the Utah city by four votes in the final round.There were rumors that Nagano had filled the pockets of IOC members. Utah officials Thomas K. Welch and David R. Johnson decided they weren’t going to be outdone, according to prosecutors.Between 1988 and 1995, according to their 15-count indictment, Welch and Johnson bribed IOC and United States Olympics officials a number of ways, including:The Utahns also allegedly arranged for a powerful Korean IOC member’s concert pianist daughter to play with the Utah Symphony. She also performed with Atlanta’s Olympic Arts Festival ahead of the 1996 games and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra before the 2000 Sydney Olympics. These performances were booked even though, as Australian Olympic bid member Shane Maloney told The Post in 1999: “I think she probably tinkled in the C division rather than the A.”Prosecutors wrote that the alleged global conspiracy saw $1 million split up among a dozen or so IOC officials. They dropped charges against Welch and Johnson midtrial in July 2001, citing a lack of evidence. U.S. District Judge David Sam said the case “offends my sense of justice,” local station KSL reported in 2003. He added that he’d never seen a case so lacking “criminal intent or evil purpose” during his 40 years in the legal system.An 82-member working group, including former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, formed to propose changes to the bidding system, The Post reported in July 1999. Members approved a 50-point plan with near unanimity in December 1999.The changes included lowering the member age limit from 80 to 70, adding 15 active athletes to the IOC and instituting eight-year terms that could be renewed.The biggest change? Banning all-expenses-paid visits to cities bidding for the Olympics, which was the biggest issue for Salt Lake City and other bidders.By the end of the scandal, the IOC would expel 10 of its members and penalize another 10. There are currently 111 IOC members.After the scandal, Salt Lake organizers brought in a Massachusetts man to save the day: venture capitalist Mitt Romney.Shortly after Romney arrived, Salt Lake organizing officials announced they had an operating budget deficit of about $380 million. So the new leader raised money, The Post reported, flying around the country to calm the nerves of sponsors frayed by scandal. He secured money from companies that hadn’t previously sponsored the Olympics, including Allstate, Sears Roebuck and Monster.com. He arranged 53 local-sponsor deals, doubling the number of those in Nagano.The businessman and devout Mormon became known as the savior of the 2002 Olympics, one of the most financially successful Winter Games.Romney was elected Massachusetts governor in 2002, eight months after the Olympics. It sparked his national star, leading to an unsuccessful bid to be Republican presidential nominee in 2008. He ran again in 2012 and won the GOP nomination, but lost to then-President Barack Obama. In 2018, he was voted into the Senate, representing Utah.But it was the 2002 Olympics that started it all for Romney.“During those games, Utah demonstrated to the entire world its unique spirit of service and fellowship. And Utah is well-prepared to host the world once again for the Winter Games. We are a leading hub for winter sports; our economy is resilient and growing; our sporting venues and infrastructure are well kept and regularly used for competition,” Romney wrote last week, when Salt Lake City won its bid to host the games in a decade.As for Vanocur, who started this all, he won a Peabody award in 1998 for his reporting.He ended his acceptance speech with a joke.“I am honored to accept this,” he said before interrupting himself and looking at gold, circular award. “Well, now that I look at it, it kind of looks like an Olympic gold medal.”"

WaPo_54,"Once Jahmal Harvey stopped fighting, he became an Olympic boxer",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/jahmal-harvey-us-boxer-paris-olympics/,2024-07-31 18:24:02.680627,,"PARIS — The boxing ring that Darrell Davis built years ago at the Oxon Hill Staff and Development Center back home in Maryland was less a ring and more a contraption, a flimsy 16-foot square marked off with ropes and pads in the corner of a room. He said he called it The Doghouse “because there was no room to run.”So when Jahmal Harvey, a 13-year-old star running back on the youth football team Davis also coached, showed up one day in 2014, Davis taught the kid a few basic moves, then gave him gloves and headgear and threw him straight into The Doghouse. He did this with all his new fighters.“Got to see if they have heart,” Davis said. “Got to find out what you’re getting before you waste your time.”Harvey faced three boxers that day, all with months of training. He walloped them all in a flurry of punches. When he was finished, Davis had his answer. “I got me a fighter,” he said to himself.Seven years later, Davis is not only a fighter but a featherweight amateur world champion, a boxer with the rare mix of speed and power who is now an Olympian. Wednesday afternoon, Harvey will face his longtime rival, Brazil’s Luiz Oliveira, in his first fight of the Paris Games in the round of 16 at 57 kg (126 pounds). He is probably the United States’ best male hope to win a boxing medal at these Games and perhaps become the first since Andre Ward in 2004 to win gold.Harvey imagined none of this that day he first went to Davis’s gym. He already knew his destiny: He was going to be an NFL running back. Already he was tearing up the fields for Davis on the Oxon Hill Roadrunners football team, the kind of back who got about three or four carries a game, racing for touchdowns every time and then not touching the ball the rest of the day out of respect for the opponent.Boxing was just something Davis suggested to stay in shape for football. Football was going to be his life.But something about putting on the gloves and hitting people appealed to Harvey. He was short and light. Despite turning every Oxon Hill Roadrunner game into a gallery of juking, cutting, sprinting highlights, he was a small child, and in the neighborhoods where he grew up around Southeast D.C. and Oxon Hill, kids his size got picked on — which meant learning young how punches are thrown.“I had already been in a lot of fights,” Harvey said on a video call not long before leaving for Paris. “Like too many to name. Too many to count.”The next week, Davis took Harvey to one of the top boxing gyms in the Washington area to spar with a fighter known in the local community. Harvey did well against that boxer, too. High school started, and Harvey had been working out so much, fluid gathered in his knees. He missed his first season of football. He started to wonder if maybe his 5-foot-6 frame wasn’t going to hold up in football.In 2016, Harvey met Gary Russell, the WBC featherweight champion from nearby Capitol Heights, and realized he could have a life as a professional boxer. He met the father of another fighter whose son was trying to go to the Olympics, and the father told him how his son got to travel around the world, often missing school.“To me, that was just the best thing ever,” Harvey said.That summer, he watched Russell’s younger brother Gary Antuanne Russell fight at the Rio de Janeiro Games. He was sold. From then, he wanted the Olympics.Harvey and Davis started hitting the boxing circuit, driving to fights all over the East Coast. That year, he won his first big tournament, the junior Olympics in Dallas. Two years later, he won them again in Charleston, S.C., and then the youth national championships in 2019.Davis kept testing him, throwing him into sparring sessions with all the top boxers around Washington and beyond — fighters older and stronger, with more experience.“I was going with guys that were national champions, that were at my weight,” Harvey said. “Then I started going up against bigger guys that were national champions. Started sparring pros. And then pros that were the world champions. Was sparring an Olympian. He always put me in there with the best.”Harvey could fight with them all, Davis said. The problem was, Harvey didn’t know how to stop fighting. He couldn’t stop being the kid in the street fights, the one with a grudge. The boxers he sparred with started holding him back with their hands or wrapping him in their arms. He hated being wrapped up in the ring.His fists would fly, punches coming in a frenzy. The bell rang, and he wouldn’t stop. He knocked the other fighters down and tried to hit them on the floor. More and more, his sparring sessions ended in brawls.Davis remembers the last time it happened, around 2016 or 2017 during a session at a gym called NoXcuse. Davis and a couple others had to pull Harvey out of the ring. On the drive home, Davis said, he told Harvey that the fighters he was sparring with were supposed to be his friends. They were helping him get better.Something changed after that. Harvey grew more determined, more focused. Davis was amazed at how Harvey seemed to mature overnight. As a fighter, Harvey got better. He became a part of USA Boxing. The pandemic came, and Harvey and Davis kept training in parks and on sidewalks, anywhere they could. In 2021, Harvey went to the world championships in Belgrade and won gold. The man he beat was 23 years old and had fought in that summer’s Tokyo Olympics.Harvey had hoped for Tokyo, but he wasn’t ready. He began imaging Paris and made getting to these Games his obsession. He was an important part of USA Boxing’s future. He was traveling the world, filling his Instagram page with pictures of places he never imagined visiting.He found he liked studying the cultures and the history. It felt new, exciting and fresh. He was going to Paris; he was sure of it. Then he started losing.The defeats came from nowhere in 2022. Before then, he had just two losses, both coming in 2017. But then he dropped three straight bouts, losing twice to Oliveira, Wednesday’s opponent. He was feeling weaker. He didn’t understand why. Finally, a doctor realized that Harvey, who had become a vegetarian a few years before, wasn’t getting enough protein and was deficient in a number of vitamins.A nutritionist urged him to start eating salmon. His strength came back. So did the victories. Last summer, he won the Pan Am Games title, beating Oliveira in the semifinals to take a 3-2 lead over his rival. After that, Paris was all but a certainty.“I know the Olympics is going to be my time to shine,” he said.Davis will be at the North Paris Arena on Wednesday afternoon. The Doghouse is long gone, replaced by a regular boxing gym with a regular boxing ring. But he keeps photos of The Doghouse on his phone, sharing them with anyone who asks.“We made something out of nothing,” he said.Just like the kid who walked into The Doghouse that first day, a fighter who needed to learn how to fight."
WaPo_55,"She’s an Olympic water polo star, but fans just want skin and hair tips",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/ashleigh-johnson-water-polo-skin-hair-tips/,2024-07-31 18:10:02.680627,,"​​​​There’s one question Olympic water polo goalie Ashleigh Johnson hears all the time: “How does she take care of her skin and hair?”​​The first Black player for the powerhouse U.S. women’s national water polo team and widely considered to be the best goalie in the world, Johnson, 29, helped the U.S. win gold in 2016 and 2021. The Americans are the prohibitive favorites again at this year’s Games in Paris.​​​​An obvious role model, Johnson regularly gets peppered at events and online with questions about her sport, height (6 feet 1 inch), heritage (Jamaican) and favorite food (Pho, a Vietnamese soup).​​But questions about her hair and skin are by far the most common. She doesn’t mind.“I wish that someone had had some hair and skin care tips for me when I was coming up.”​​So here, for the first time, she shows us what years of practice and experimentation have taught her can keep hair and skin healthy, however much time we spend in the pool.​​Despite some misconceptions to the contrary, Black skin requires protection from the sun’s rays, Johnson says. She relies on a zinc-based sunscreen for outdoor training and competition and a different version without zinc for most occasions on land, to better blend with her skin tone.After getting out of the pool, it’s time to remove all of that sunscreen, as gently as possible, Johnson says. ​​​​Usually, she’ll do this in the shower with a cleansing oil that she rubs in deeply, to take off the sunscreen without drying her skin.​​Now it’s time for more cleansing, to remove the cleansing oil with a separate, light cleanser. After much experimentation, Johnson says she’s found a product that removes the oil without causing her skin to break out. (Johnson does not have endorsement deals with any of the products she mentions.)​​Because the sun, chlorine and pool water will wring moisture from a swimmer’s skin, Johnson says, it’s essential to moisturize, early and often, after swimming. “Everything for me is about moisture,” she says. Beginning with a hydrating spray serum (hers is Snail Mucin from Cosrx), she also layers on a moisturizing cream and carries a night cream with her in her car and swim bag.​​The pool can also play havoc with your hair’s health, Johnson says.​Currently, her hair is styled in straight-back cornrows, which fit under her swim cap and protect the hair from damage and breakage. But it still needs moisturizing, she says. She manages this with a daily spray-in conditioner, followed by rosemary oil, and, about once a week, a hair mask. She also masks her skin weekly, and — because her travel schedule is so busy — often uses the time on airplanes to apply the masks.Since water polo players aren’t allowed to wear goggles during matches, Johnson has begun using a new type of contact lens that’s designed to block UV rays. Orange-tinted, they ease glare and strain from the sun, she says, and as a side benefit during competitions, they give your gaze an intimidating, orangy glow.​​The final but perhaps most essential step in any swimmers’ hair- and skin care routine, Johnson says, is to experiment and innovate, shedding those steps or products that don’t seem to work for you and finding others that do.​​The broad outlines of her post-pool routine — i.e., moisture, moisture, moisture — are likely to be effective for almost all of us, she says. But don’t hesitate to play around with options and “see how your skin responds to it, how your hair responds to it. It's a process. It's a journey.”​​And it’s a journey worth taking, she believes, if it encourages you or anyone else, young or old, of any race or ethnicity, to begin or keep swimming, especially if you otherwise worry pool chlorine might be too damaging or pool culture too unwelcoming.“For any young, African American, Black girls who want to get into water polo,” she says, “I would say, dive in. If you don’t know how to swim, learn to swim, if you know how to swim, jump in, grab a ball.”"

Happy National Avocado Day. We will be celebrating by eating guacamole and avocado toast. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.🚨Breaking news: Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political operations, has been killed in Iran, Hamas announced early Wednesday. He was killed in Tehran after participating in the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Hamas said in a statement.In today’s edition … New bipartisan bill aims to tackle child care costs, access … Mark Kelly could help Harris on immigration … but first …House Democrats have been eager to counter GOP attacks that their party is bad at tackling crime, campaigning on a flurry of bills as they eye winning back the majority.Then Vice President Harris entered the picture as the likely presidential nominee — and they say their job got easier.House Democrats, many of whom have tried for years to disavow their liberal colleagues’ push to “defund the police,” feel that from her perch atop the ticket, Harris can more forcefully argue the Democratic Party can be tough on crime — because she herself has been tough on crime.What was once her liability has now become an asset for the party.Harris began her career as a prosecutor in San Francisco, where she targeted robberies, homicides and sexual abuse cases, as well as three-strike offenders. Then, as San Francisco district attorney general, she pushed for higher bail for those involved in gun-related crimes, convicted marijuana offenses, and tried to lower San Francisco’s high murder rate by expediting consideration of backlogged cases. She then served as California’s attorney general for five years before winning her Senate race in 2016.Hill Democrats tell us they’re excited to hear Harris lean in and embrace her career record. So much so that they quickly picked up on her “prosecutor versus convicted felon” contrast to tout why they liked her atop the ticket against former president Donald Trump. (Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records and indicted in three other cases).Rep. Hillary J. Scholten (D), who represents a swing district in Michigan, said that Harris embracing her career “certainly helps in a place like West Michigan” where she has already had “moderate, even conservative crossover voters” express excitement about the vice president.Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the base wants someone to beat Trump and thinks it’s understood that Harris is invoking her law enforcement record to serve as a “contrast with Trump.”Liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sees Harris’s past record as an opportunity for her to go after “corporate crime” that is “ripping off the American people.”But Democratic lawmakers vary on how Harris should tout her past in her campaign, with the pragmatists hoping she proposes public safety solutions to win key swing districts and states, while progressives hope she moves more to the left and pledges to overhaul the criminal justice system.Because it’s the general election, Harris must manage the existing tensions between both flanks of her party. How she does so could shape how voters view her public safety record.Harris also drew that “prosecutor versus felon” contrast in her 2020 presidential campaign, but she largely glossed over details of her career to avoid irritating the progressive base she and many other Democrats were trying to win over in a crowded primary battle.Republicans trying to sour her “tough on crime” message are unearthing ways she downplayed her record back then, pointing to the way she teetered on questions about defunding the police, charging migrants as criminals for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without proper documentation, or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.The reality is that violent crime is decreasing. The Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan think tank, found that “monthly offense rates for 12 violent, property and drug crimes in 39 cities” were lower in the first half of 2024 than the same time period in 2023. The only crime that has seen a spike is shoplifting, with a 24 percent increase.Most violent crimes, according to the report, “are at or below levels seen in 2019, the year prior to the onset of the covid pandemic and racial justice protests of 2020.”But many Americans believe crime remains historically high amid GOP dominance on framing the issue and far-left progressives’ anti-police stance. Twenty-three of 27 Gallup polls that have tracked what Americans think about crime since 1993 showed that roughly three-fifths of U.S. adults believe crime has risen over the past year.Democrats know they have a lot of work to do to flip the script if they want to also flip the House majority this November. The New Democrat Coalition, a group of 100 pragmatic moderate and liberal House Democrats, proposed a slate of 15 largely bipartisan bills the House could take up this year — or next year if Democrats hold the reins of the majority.The proposals range from preventing auto theft, combating opioid trafficking, providing federal grants for communities to recruit and invest in new police officers and preventing gun violence.Democrats believe they can make the case they and Harris should be in charge next year by spending the next month at home talking about their public safety record and pointing out that House Republicans have voted to slash funding for the FBI, DHS and other federal government agencies.We are absolutely watching for more signs of who Harris chooses as her nominee. She’ll be crisscrossing the country next week with her running mate in a seven-state battleground swing, beginning in Philadelphia on Tuesday.Today, she will travel to Houston to speak at Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority’s 60th International Biennial Boule.Trump will attend the National Association of Black Journalists conference and then will travel to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, for a rally.The Education Department will begin emailing millions of student loan borrowers today to let them opt out of Biden’s new policy to reduce or eliminate their balances, advancing an alternative plan to the program struck down by the Supreme Court last year, Danielle Douglas-Gabriel reports. We’re watching for opposition from conservatives who consider the policies fiscally irresponsible.Also today, the White House is backing proposals to permanently stiffen penalties on synthetic drug traffickers, monitor machines used to make fentanyl pills and close a loophole that allows criminal groups to easily ship drugs in packages, David Ovalle reports.As expected, Kari Lake won the Republican Senate primary against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. Lake, a devout election denier, will face Rep. Ruben Gallego in an open seat that could determine control of the Senate.In the 1st district, Democrat Amish Shah was leading in a crowded primary. The winner will try to unseat six-term Rep. David Schweikert in the swing district.In the 2nd district, Freedom Caucus member Rep. Eli Crane beat back a primary challenge in the safe red seat by former county commissioner Jack Smith. Smith was backed by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as part of his “revenge tour” against the eight Republicans who voted to oust him last year.In the 3rd district, Yassamin Ansari was leading in a crowded primary to fill the open seat vacated by Gallego to run for the Senate. Ansari would be the first Iranian American to represent Arizona if elected.In the 8th district, Abraham Hamadeh was leading in the safe Republican seat of retiring Rep. Debbie Lesko. Trump initially endorsed Hamadeh but then backed Masters this past weekend. JD Vance — a friend of Masters — backed him last year.Trump is already going after Harris on immigration, focusing on it in ads and calling her “dangerously liberal.” But some hope that by selecting Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) as her running mate, Harris could partly inoculate herself on one of her toughest issues, considering Kelly’s recent backing of Biden’s executive order cracking down on asylum seekers.“Kelly’s eagerness to associate himself with a tough border measure just weeks ago is now suddenly seen as his greatest asset as he vies to become Kamala Harris’s running mate in a transformed presidential race,” our colleagues Liz Goodwin and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez report. “The two-term Arizona senator and former NASA astronaut is fluent in and brings some credibility to what’s perceived as Harris’s weakest issue as a candidate: security of America’s southern border.”Kelly was a vocal proponent of the bipartisan border deal that ultimately failed in February and has built deep relationships with border officials, law enforcement and migrant-rights activists in Arizona.But Kelly also has weaknesses as a vice-presidential pick. Biden and Harris have underperformed in Arizona vs. Trump so far, casting doubt on whether Kelly could deliver a swing state. He also only has four years of political experience, none of it executive, and some union leaders have raised concerns that he is not sufficiently pro-labor.A new bipartisan effort by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Katie Boyd Britt (R-Ala.) attempts to address soaring child care costs and lack of availability of care.The pair of bills would expand already available tax credits for parents and employers the senators say are underused in an attempt to ease the burden of child care. They would also create a pilot program that would subsidize home- and center-based child workers’ salaries to promote retention and expand the workforce.“Here’s an additional thing that has been part of law for a long time, but it’s not working,” Kaine said. “We can make it work better.”The bill would expand the Child Dependent Tax Credit to be refundable so low-income people who don’t pay taxes can benefit. It would expand the tax-deductible amount an employee can contribute to a Dependent Care Account and triple the employer tax credit for providing child care benefits. An accompanying bill would provide child care workers with an annual subsidy.“I think it empowers those parents that do want to enter the workforce to be able to have that ability to do so,” Britt said. For her skeptical colleagues reluctant to provide benefits for child care, she added, “we’re not creating an entitlement.”Legislation to ease the burden of child care falls in the bucket of lofty societal goals like paid family leave or elder care. It won’t move this year, but they hope it is included in a tax bill expected to be considered next year as many of the 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire.Bloomberg-backed gun regulation group pledges $45 million for election.

On the men’s side, French phenom Leon Marchand and Chinese teenager Pan Zhanle each made history. Spanish dream team duo Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal fell in the quarterfinals of the men’s tennis tournament at Roland Garros. Continue reading for today’s highlights from the Paris Games."
WaPo_58,"Commanders offer ‘Tunnel Club’ membership for fans with $15,000 to spare",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/commanders-tunnel-club/,2024-07-31 20:00:02.920049,,"The Washington Commanders will unveil an array of upgrades to their stadium in Landover this season, including a premium space that will let fans interact with players on game days.The “Tunnel Club,” a 2,100-square-foot space in the tunnel of the stadium, will give 150 season ticket holders access to an area where players travel to and from the field and locker room. Membership includes exclusive stadium entry, parking, field access before the game and all-inclusive food and beverage. It also comes with admission to select events with team executives and an all-inclusive trip to a road game, among other perks.The team worked with architectural design firm Populous on the club concept and turned to Clark Construction to build it, which it teased in renderings Wednesday.The chance to high-five Terry McLaurin pregame doesn’t come cheap. Membership starts at $15,000 and includes two passes to the Tunnel Club.Washington’s ownership group, led by Josh Harris, has put more than $75 million into the stadium since it purchased the team in July 2023. The group began to make incremental improvements before its inaugural season and has continued to make alterations ahead of Year 2. Its goal: Create a more attractive game-day experience in Landover while continuing to search for a new stadium location in D.C., Maryland or Virginia.“We’re going to improve the existing stadium as much as we can while we look for a new home because it’s not the bones, necessarily,” Harris said of the Landover stadium in November. “The bones obviously can be repaired; they can be fixed. It’s more the way modern stadiums are set up; they’re very different than stadiums that are older. And so whether it’s the premium areas being really close to the game itself, how the suites are situated, how much premium there is, the WiFi — I mean, a lot of that stuff just can’t be done in an older stadium. So we’re going to be looking at ultimately how do we move to a new stadium.”The team announced most of the changes in February, including the 1932 Club, a 22,000-square-foot premium space for season ticket holders. It includes 28 private suites for up to 12 people apiece (all are sold out) and 108 theater box seats. Like the Tunnel Club, membership to the 1932 Club comes with catering and access to select membership events. (The franchise was established in 1932.)In 2022, under the ownership of Daniel Snyder, the team added terrace tables to the club level for season ticket holders. The private seating, located in the east and west end zones, includes a “half-moon” table, mesh seating, complimentary beer and cocktails and, in certain areas, complimentary food service. This offseason the team added 72 more terrace tables.Washington also added touchless security at all of the stadium’s entry gates, upgraded the sound system and lighting, added touchless food and beverage markets on the main concourse, resurfaced parking lots and updated furnishings and carpet on the club level.To help with the costs, NFL owners approved $86.5 million in funding for the Commanders for stadium improvements, which would amount to a loan from the visiting teams’ shares of ticket revenue.Still on the to-do list for the Commanders is finding a naming rights partner. Shipping giant FedEx severed its agreement with the team two years early, sapping the Commanders of roughly $15 million in remaining revenue from the deal."
WaPo_59,Copycat weight-loss drugs are major players with consumers,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/copycat-weight-loss-drugs-are-major-players-with-consumers/,2024-07-31 19:40:02.920049,,"Hello, I’m Arthur Allen. I write about the drug industry and related topics for KFF Health News. If you know of a neglected story in this area, send me a nudge at aallen@kff.org.Today’s edition: The White House is urging Congress to crack down on fentanyl traffickers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching a fall vaccination push for livestock workers. But first …Compounding pharmacies’ big stake in anti-obesity drugsAs many as 1 in 8 American adults has tried one of the GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs, but a surprising number aren’t getting their supplies from pharma giants Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly. Up to 30 percent of the market, by some estimates, is made up of copycat versions from compounding pharmacies.Compounding is legal, though the resulting products sometimes fall into a gray area because they’re copies of drugs under patent and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Mark Mikhael, CEO of Orlando-based Olympia Pharmaceuticals, estimates that his and other large compounders provision up to 2 million Americans each month with semaglutide, the scientific name for Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus formulations, or tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound and Mounjaro.Many of the compounded drugs are produced for and sold by online pharmacies like Hims & Hers Health, Henry Meds and Ro. Others come from smaller compounding companies.Novo Nordisk and Lilly fiercely oppose these sales and lump the compounders together with unregulated medical spas peddling bogus semaglutide. Novo Nordisk has filed at least 21 lawsuits nationwide against companies making purported copies of its drugs, said Brianna Kelley, a spokesperson for the company, and urges doctors to avoid them.When there’s a drug shortage — the FDA has put semaglutide and tirzepatide on shortage lists since 2022 — the agency allows compounders to make it. The compounding companies get raw material for the drugs from mostly Chinese businesses that are registered and, at least in theory, inspected by the FDA.Because the drugs are not strictly FDA-approved, those who make, prescribe or take them should exercise “an increased level of responsibility or awareness,” FDA spokesperson Amanda Hils said.But she distinguished the compounded drugs from unregulated powders sold as “generic Ozempic” and the like, which may be contaminated or counterfeit. The agency recently warned about patients taking the wrong doses of the compounds, but it hasn’t received a disproportionate number of side effect reports linked to these drugs.Semaglutide and tirzepatide have registered unprecedented success in weight loss. They are also showing promise against heart, kidney and liver diseases, and are being tested to treat or prevent Alzheimer’s disease and drug addiction. It’s no wonder they are in shortage.While most compounded drugs are copies of old, cheap generics, semaglutide and tirzepatide are under patent and earn Novo Nordisk and Lilly billions of dollars a year. Compounded forms are cheaper, particularly for patients whose insurers won’t cover the branded drugs.While the pharmaceutical giants can’t keep up with demand, they dispute the right of compounders to make and sell copies. Lilly spokesperson Kristiane Silva Bello said her company was “deeply concerned” about “serious health risks” from compounded drugs that “should not be on the market.”Mikhael’s company is an outsourcing facility, or 503B compounding pharmacy — regulated directly by the FDA. Smaller 503A pharmacies are largely overseen by state boards of pharmacy.The compounders are defiant, calling the diabetes and diet drugs essential products.“If you don’t want a 503B facility to make a copy, it’s pretty simple: Don’t go short,” said Lee Rosebush, chair of a trade association for 503B pharmacies. “FDA created this system because these are necessary drugs.”KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — an independent source of health policy research, polling and journalism.Biden urges Congress to get tougher on fentanyl traffickersNew this a.m.: The White House is endorsing proposals to stiffen penalties on synthetic drug traffickers, monitor machines used to make fentanyl pills and close a loophole that allows criminal groups to easily ship drugs in packages, The Post’s David Ovalle reports.President Biden is calling on Congress this morning to greenlight a bipartisan border security bill that passed the Senate but died in the GOP-controlled House. “These are the key investments needed to stop fentanyl from reaching our communities,” he said in a statement.Biden is also issuing a national security memo calling on federal agencies “to do even more” to stop fentanyl trafficking.The bigger picture: Biden announced the initiatives as state and federal officials grapple with how to curb a drug epidemic that has killed more than 300,000 people during his administration alone. Border security has proved to be a political flash point, with Republicans hammering the White House about the failure to stop fentanyl from entering the country.CDC announces $5 million effort to vaccinate livestock workersThe CDC is launching a $5 million initiative to provide seasonal flu shots this fall to about 200,000 livestock workers in states hit hardest by the bird flu outbreak, The Post’s Lena H. Sun reports.The agency will buy the seasonal flu shots and states can order them as needed. The CDC is also awarding $5 million to community organizations for outreach and education efforts.Why it matters: Workers at poultry, dairy and pig farms are at greatest risk of being simultaneously exposed to seasonal flu and the H5N1 bird flu. Duel exposure raises the rare but serious possibility of the viruses exchanging genetic material, potentially creating a new influenza strain that could be more transmissible and severe, according to Nirav Shah, CDC’s principal deputy director. He said widespread seasonal flu vaccination would reduce that risk.Yes, but: Despite having a stockpile of 4.8 million doses of the H5N1 bird flu vaccine, the federal government isn’t currently recommending its use in farmworkers. The rationale? The 13 infections reported in humans so far have had mild symptoms, and the virus isn’t spreading between people or asymptomatically. However, Shah noted that discussions on the matter are ongoing.Study: Suicide among preteens is risingNew federal data shows that the suicide rate for U.S. preteens has steadily climbed over the past decade and a half, especially among young girls, our colleague Sabrina Malhi reports.By the numbers: Between 2001 and 2022, a total of 2,241 children ages 8 to 12 years old died by suicide. After a period of decline until 2007, rates increased by about 8 percent annually from 2008 to 2022, according to a report from the National Institute of Mental Health.Boys continue to have a higher suicide rate overall, but girls have experienced a disproportionate increase over the past 15 years. Suicide was the fifth leading cause of death among girls ages 8 to 12 between 2008 and 2022, moving up from being the 11th leading cause between 2001 and 2007.The bigger picture: The study’s authors blamed no single reason for the increase, but outside experts say the problem is multifaceted, citing technology, social media and guns as the main culprits. The coronavirus pandemic also led to increases in anxiety, depression and other mental health issues nationwide.Senate plows ahead on bipartisan health-care billsOn tap today: The Senate, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee set to mark up three bipartisan health-care measures.One key bill up for consideration would reauthorize the Older Americans Act, which supports home and community-based services for seniors and is set to expire at the end of September. It proposes more than $2.7 billion in funding for fiscal 2025, with annual 4.6 percent increases over the next five years.The committee will also vote on legislation to bolster programs and research related to autism spectrum disorder, as well as a measure to reauthorize prevention, surveillance and programs related to traumatic brain injury.In other news from Capitol Hill …The Senate passed a pair of bills to enhance online privacy and safety protections for children, handing a win for parents and youth activists who argue tech companies endanger children’s well-being, The Post’s Cristiano Lima-Strong reports.The legislation, approved 91-3, would force digital platforms to take “reasonable” steps to protect children and extend existing federal privacy protections to include those 16 years and younger. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) voted against the bills.Next steps: Supporters hope Senate approval will pressure the House to take up the package, which has bipartisan backing but faced setbacks last month due to infighting among House Republican leaders.When private equity buys a hospital, assets shrink, new research finds (By Peter Whoriskey | The Washington Post)Testimony: Florida wrongly cut people from Medicaid due to ‘computer error,’ bad data (By Charlie McGee | The Tributary)Woman sues Kansas hospital over alleged denial of emergency abortion (By Nadine El-Bawab | ABC News) NEW Alzheimer's test 90% accurate A new study shows that a simple blood test can outperform traditional exams when it comes to determining whether Alzheimer’s is responsible for memory problems, accurately diagnosing the disease about 90 percent of the time. Compare that with dementia specialists who successfully identified Alzheimer’s 73 percent of the time, while primary care doctors did so with a 61 percent rate, according to the study of 1,213 patients in Sweden that was published Sunday on JAMA, the journal published by the American Medical Association, and presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on the same day in Philadelphia. The encouraging findings come amid larger efforts to develop a cheap, simple blood test that can quickly diagnose patients with Alzheimer’s without forcing people to undergo more expensive and invasive exams, such as spinal taps. Although blood tests are already used in clinics, they are often not covered by insurance, costing hundreds of dollars or more.Thanks for reading! Not a subscriber? Sign up here."
WaPo_60,"Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran, sparking fears of wider war",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/hamas-leader-assassinated-iran-israel/,2024-07-31 19:26:02.920049,,"JERUSALEM — Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed early Wednesday in central Tehran, an apparent assassination that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel and pledged to avenge. The killing, following a strike in Lebanon that Israel said killed a senior Hezbollah military commander, threatened to plunge the unstable region further into chaos and raised fresh doubts about Gaza cease-fire talks underway in Rome.Israeli officials declined to comment on the death of Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief in exile who was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of the newly elected Iranian president. Details of the killing remained unclear.The killing came hours after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut targeted a senior leader of Hezbollah, another Iranian-backed militant group locked in combat with Israel. The Israel Defense Forces said Fuad Shukr was killed in the Tuesday evening attack, blaming him for the weekend rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12. Hezbollah has acknowledged his presence in the demolished building but said recovery efforts were continuing.The deadly events marked the end of two key leaders of Tehran’s proxy militant groups in the region. Reports in Arabic media said that a third, Ziad al-Nakhaleh, the secretary general of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was in the building where Haniyeh was killed.Security analysts said the events would push the region closer to a regionwide conflict, with Iran compelled to respond to an attack in the heart of its capital. The events come just months after Iran and Israel exchanged missile and rocket attacks in a confrontation that experts warned was flirting with all-out war.Israeli experts said Israel hoped the risk of escalation would be outweighed by a demonstration of military and intelligence prowess that allowed it to reach deep into the Iranian capital.“I don’t think it will change the balance of power or the face of the war, but it sends a strong signal to Iran and the axis [of proxy militant groups],” said Yoel Guzansky, a former official on Israel’s National Security Council who is now a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “It shows them they cannot be safe anywhere, even in Tehran.”“I think this is Israel getting some of its reputation for deterrence back,” he said.The Israeli military, without commenting on the Tehran attack, said it was not implementing precautionary measures across the country Wednesday, telling citizens there were “no changes in the Home Front Command defensive guidelines.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu scheduled a midday meeting with commanders at the country’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv.Haniyeh’s killing was met with immediate condemnation and outrage across the Arab and Muslim world, with Iran threatening to retaliate.A spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said the killing would “strengthen the deep and unbreakable bond between the Islamic Republic of Iran and dear Palestine and the resistance.”The head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, called it a “cowardly act and dangerous development.”U.S. officials declined to comment on Iran’s claim that Israel was responsible for Haniyeh’s killing. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in Singapore on Wednesday during a visit to Southeast and East Asia, had no comment but expressed hope the situation could still be defused.“I don’t think war is inevitable. I maintain that. I think there’s always room and opportunities for diplomacy,” he told reporters. “We’re going to do everything we can to make sure that we keep things from turning into a broader conflict throughout the region.” He said he had not yet spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.Israel’s silence was in keeping with its usual posture following high-profile strikes and assassinations around the region, a policy of “strategic ambiguity” that allows it to avoid official responsibility for extraterritorial operations while benefiting from the deterrent effect. After the missile strike in Iranian territory in the spring — following a barrage of rockets and drones fired from Iran toward Israel — official channels were quiet.Within hours Wednesday, analysts had moved beyond the question of Israel’s role and on to what purpose the killing served.In the case of Shukr, which Israel has taken responsibility for, the Israeli military eliminated the Hezbollah leader they considered the group’s operational mastermind.The IDF said it was specifically targeting the official responsible for the rocket attack that killed 12, all children and teenagers, on a village soccer field in the occupied Golan Heights. But beyond that, Shukr was a longtime lieutenant to Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah and seen by the IDF as the group’s “senior military commander.”Haniyeh’s killing may serve a more symbolic goal, Guzansky said.Haniyeh was Hamas’s longtime political leader who lived mostly in the Qatari capital Doha. But his role at the top of the group’s hierarchy has been in question since Hamas’s military leader in Gaza, Yehiya Sinwar, launched the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and had been seen to manage the war along with negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release ever since.“Sinwar might be pretty happy right now. The two were rivals inside of Hamas,” Guzansky said. But Haniyeh’s killing could have immediate impact on the most recent round of talks taking place in Rome, which U.S. officials had described as the most promising for months. Haniyeh retained an important role in negotiations, and was a key decision-maker along with Sinwar, according to a diplomat briefed on the talks.“He was someone who saw the value of a deal and was instrumental to getting certain breakthroughs in the talks,” said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the negotiations. “At this stage, it’s unclear what the effect will be on cease-fire talks.”Mick Mulroy, a former CIA and Marine Corps official and top Pentagon aide for the Middle East during the Trump administration, said Haniyeh’s killing represented an “absolute embarrassment” for Iran.“Haniyeh was their guest,” he said. “This was a complete failure of their security.” He said Israel “obviously had exquisite intelligence in order to carry out this precise assassination strike.”Both Iran and Hamas promised to retaliate.“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement Wednesday, according to state-run media. Suhail al-Hindi, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, promised revenge for Haniyeh, whose funeral is set to take place in Doha on Friday. The killing was a “significant blow to the Palestinian cause,” he said, though he added, “Hamas is an institutional movement that remains unharmed by the martyrdom of its leader.”Susannah George in Dubai, Michael Birnbaum in Singapore, Missy Ryan and Miriam Berger in Jerusalem, Sarah Dadouch in Beirut, Hazem Balousha and Heba Farouk Mahfouz in Cairo and Hajar Harb in London contributed to this report."
WaPo_61,The Olympics’ ‘Last Supper’ scene demanded our attention,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/last-supper-opening-ceremony-paris-olympics/,2024-07-31 19:10:02.920049,,"As the great Fran Lebowitz has said, “Being offended is the natural consequence of leaving one’s home.” If the Opening Ceremonies of the Paris Games were offensive to various purported spokespeople for Jesus, Donald Trump or Harris Faulkner of Fox News, then they better avoid the Musée d’Orsay, train stations and the public streets. When it comes to art, they should stick to calendars.The Opening Ceremonies clearly aspired to be art, as designed by theatrical director Thomas Jolly, who has staged works for the Paris Opera. You may debate among yourselves whether he achieved it. But you may not tell me what should offend me. You know what does offend me? Paintings titled “Untitled.”The Paris Games have been a glory so far — the athletic spiraling against those spectacular ancient plein-air venues qualifies as artistry in and of itself. The acrobatic, vivid Opening Ceremonies in a way set the tone for your perception of all of it, persuading the audience to look at spangled bodies bounding through the air as art and athletes as artists, painting the air in their own way. And if they’re ephemeral, they’re nevertheless painted on our minds. Jolly’s creation referenced art in almost every phase — music, literature and painting, literally “framing” the Games.Why some church leaders are so often hostile to experimental art and treat it as anti-faith is an unanswerable question. But it’s certainly not a modern phenomenon. Those flogging the Opening Ceremonies over one fleeting pagan tableau in a spellbinding four-hour ceremony belong to the same dry line of self-appointed judges left in the dust of history who misjudged works in their own day for not being properly venerating. The ones who scolded Delacroix, for his “Christ in the Garden of Olives,” because he gave the body too much “ochreish flesh modeling.” Or Manet for his “Dead Christ,” excoriated as “audaciously bad taste, the negation of scientific anatomy, spoiled color.” Religious critics seem to reserve the right to be censorious not just in the use of paint but in depictions of physique.If you think Jolly’s tableau of vampers and drag queens was unsettling to your Christian sensibilities, for God’s sake don’t go into the Musée d’Orsay and see Jean Delville’s “L’Ecole de Platon,” a monumental canvas that appears to portray Jesus surrounded by voluptuous, naked, androgynous disciples with limbs wound sensuously around each other. Offensive? Maybe, until you learn the painting is actually of Plato, meant to signify the transition from the pagan world to the Christian one, and the hermaphrodites were considered by the painter representative of purity and an evolution toward divinity. Then you pay closer attention.The purpose of art is to command your deep attention — not in a narcissistic way but in a self-reflective one. Just like athletics. Or faith. The great Presbyterian minister, writer and theologian Frederick Buechner, who began his adult life as a novelist before entering the seminary, believed art was not hostile to faith but its mimic. “From the simplest lyric to the most complex novel and densest drama, literature is asking us to pay attention,” he wrote. “… Pay attention to the west wind. Pay attention to the boy on the raft, the lady in the tower, the old man on the train.”If we are to love our neighbors, Buechner preached, we first have to see them, attend to them. That is all Jolly asked you to do in his spectacle: to see. All the religious police see are phantom insults. That drag queen sequence was meant to refer, like Delville, to Greek pagan celebrations — not, as some Christian leaders insist, to mock Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper.” Regardless of the intention, how on earth do Christian sensitivities justify making DJ Barbara Butch — who appeared in the center of that scene — the focus of vileness, death threats and antisemitism?Buechner wrote this: “Rembrandt puts a frame around an old woman’s face. It is seamed with wrinkles. The upper lip is sunken in, the skin waxy and pale. It is not a remarkable face. You would not look twice at the old woman if you found her sitting across the aisle from you on a bus. But it is a face so remarkably seen that it forces you to see it remarkably.”Perhaps, just perhaps, Jolly is a better, truer worshiper than his critics. At the least, he did something they have failed to do: He saw faces and framed them with interest, rather than hostility. Buechner continues: “Is it too much to say that to stop, look and listen is also the most basic lesson that the Judeo-Christian tradition teaches us? … And when Jesus comes along saying that the greatest command of all is to love God and to love our neighbor, he too is asking us to pay attention.”Critics of the Opening Ceremonies certainly have paid attention — to all the wrong things. Buechner also wrote that it’s not quite enough just to stare at something. We also have to see, “with our imagination as well as our eyes, that is to say like artists, we must not see their faces but the life behind and within their faces.”"

Hamas and Iran both blamed Israel and vowed to retaliate; the Israel Defense Forces declined to comment. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge the killing, and Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned of “major repercussions” for the whole region. Haniyeh was based in Qatar and was a key voice in the cease-fire talks with Israel over its war in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how he was killed. The killing took place hours after Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut, and risks further escalating tensions across the fraught region."

He will succeed Dave Calhoun, who has previously said he will retire this year.Calhoun’s last several months as Boeing’s leader have been marred by a series of crises, including the Alaska Air blowout in January; production issues; difficult labor negotiations; glitches that have stretched out the first crewed flight of the Starliner space capsule; and a guilty plea to felony fraud related to 737 Max crashes from years ago.Also Wednesday, the company reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.4 billion, more than triple that of a year earlier. Its revenue came in at $16.8 billion, down 14 percent from the same quarter last year.Boeing chair Steven Mollenkopf said the choice of Ortberg came after an extensive search over the past several months.“Kelly is an experienced leader who is deeply respected in the aerospace industry, with a well-earned reputation for building strong teams and running complex engineering and manufacturing companies,” Mollenkopf said in a statement.Ortberg will also join Boeing’s board of directors.This is a developing story and will be updated."

WaPo_65,"For select group of Commanders fans, ‘Tunnel Club’ offers intimate access",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/commanders-tunnel-club/,2024-07-31 20:00:02.729272,,"The Washington Commanders will unveil an array of upgrades to their stadium in Landover this season, including a premium space that will let fans interact with players on game days.The aptly named Tunnel Club, a 2,100-square-foot space in the tunnel of the stadium, will give 150 season ticket holders access to an area where players travel to and from the field and locker room. Membership includes exclusive stadium entry, parking, field access before the game and all-inclusive food and beverage. It also comes with admission to select events with team executives, among other perks.The team worked with the architectural design firm Populous on the concept of the club and turned to Clark Construction for the build out, which it teased in renderings Wednesday.The chance to high-five Terry McLaurin pregame doesn’t come cheap. Membership starts at $15,000 and includes two passes to the Tunnel Club.Washington’s ownership group, led by Josh Harris, has put more than $75 million into the stadium since it purchased the team in July 2023. The group began to make incremental improvements before its inaugural season and has continued to make alterations ahead of Year 2. Its goal: Create a more attractive game-day experience in Landover while continuing to search for a new stadium location in D.C., Maryland or Virginia.“We’re going to improve the existing stadium as much as we can while we look for a new home because it’s not the bones, necessarily,” Harris said of the Landover stadium in November. “The bones obviously can be repaired; they can be fixed. It’s more the way modern stadiums are set up; they’re very different than stadiums that are older. And so whether it’s the premium areas being really close to the game itself, how the suites are situated, how much premium there is, the WiFi, I mean, a lot of that stuff just can’t be done in an older stadium. So we’re going to be looking at ultimately how do we move to a new stadium.”The team announced most of the changes in February, including the 1932 Club, a 22,000-square-foot premium space for season-ticket holders. It includes 28 private suites for up to 12 people apiece (all are sold out), and 108 theater box seats. Like the Tunnel Club, membership to the 1932 Club comes with catering and access to select membership events (1932 is the year the franchise was established).In 2022, under the ownership of Daniel Snyder, the team added terrace tables to the club level for season ticket holders. The private seating, located in the east and west end zones, includes a “half-moon” table, mesh seating, complimentary beer and cocktails and, in certain areas, complimentary food service. This offseason the team added 72 more terrace tables.Washington also added touchless security at all of the stadium’s entry gates, upgraded the sound system and lighting, added touchless food and beverage markets on the main concourse, resurfaced parking lots and updated furnishings and carpet on the club level.To help with the upfront costs, NFL owners approved $86.5 million in funding for the Commanders for stadium improvements, which would amount to a loan from the visiting teams’ shares of ticket revenue.Still on the to-do list for the Commanders is finding a naming rights partner. The shipping giant FedEx severed its agreement with the team two years early, sapping the Commanders of roughly $15 million in remaining revenue from the deal."
WaPo_66,Live updates: Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh assassinated; Iran vows revenge,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/30/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-haniyeh/,2024-07-31 20:52:02.729272,,"Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed in Iran, Hamas announced Wednesday, describing the death as an assassination. Hamas and Iran both blamed Israel and vowed to retaliate; the Israel Defense Forces declined to comment. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge the killing, and Hamas’s armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned of “major repercussions” for the whole region. Haniyeh was based in Qatar and was a key voice in the cease-fire talks with Israel over its war in Gaza. It was not immediately clear how he was killed. The killing took place hours after Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut, and risks further escalating tensions across the fraught region."
WaPo_67,Can Kamala Harris keep up her momentum?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/kamala-harris-2024-trump/,2024-07-31 20:00:02.729272,,"You’re reading the Prompt 2024 newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox. It’s hard to imagine things going better for Vice President Harris than they have over the last 10 days. A huge infusion of cash. Improvement in the polls. Donald Trump freaking out, saying even weirder stuff than usual and telling people he’ll “fix” our political system so they won’t have to vote again in four years. Democrats are uncommonly unified and motivated, while Republicans are scrambling to settle on a message that doesn’t involve calling Harris a “ding dong” who “giggles.”Will the momentum continue? I’m here with fellow Post columnists Molly Roberts and Catherine Rampell to discuss how Harris can keep the energy going.Dana Milbank: This was always going to be an extremely close race and still will be. Republicans will settle on a message, even if it’s the old standby of calling Harris a socialist/communist/Marxist lunatic. Democrats will be Democrats and squabble among themselves. That said, Harris has an opportunity to extend her winning streak for a few more weeks with her VP pick and with the Democratic convention, perhaps followed by debates if Trump will allow them to happen. So what should Harris be doing now to spread the appeal of Kamalot to all the land?Molly Roberts: Ah, I see you’ve used the word “weird” in your intro! It’s become a popular way to describe the GOP among campaign surrogates and even Harris herself. I do think leaning in to the meme-mentum is helpful, from both sides: to create a favorable image of Kamala (see: “coconut-pilling”) and to forge an unfavorable one of Trump and JD Vance. A lot of what’s happened here can be described as a vibe shift from the listless, almost inert, aura of President Biden’s campaign to something more energetic. That fits, of course, with a younger and fresher candidate. So keeping the viral content rolling with whatever trends pop up on social media is smart.Dana: Yes, the weirdness is a good theme because it goes beyond political leaning. These people are objectively odd.Catherine Rampell: I think the most helpful thing would be to embrace the “Kamala is a cop” meme that incidentally helped sink her presidential primary campaign in 2020. What was a liability then is a huge asset now because crime is the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats (even more so than immigration or inflation, if you look at polling). Harris has talked about her prior career as a prosecutor in her stump speeches, but usually in the context of Trump’s felony convictions and other tenuous relationships with the law. “Crook vs. cop” is a nice (alliterative!) framing, but I’m not sure it’s sufficient to win over more moderate voters, who might not have been following Trump’s trials closely. Better to talk about the broader Democratic record on reducing violent crime, what she’d do to help, her prosecutorial bona fides, etc.Dana: Catherine, that raises an interesting question of whether Harris should be talking about her record at all, or just taking it straight to Trump. I think that 10-minute riff of her saying “I’m the prosecutor and he’s the felon” should be the melody of the campaign, over and over again.Catherine: Yeah, again, I think it’s a catchy-sounding frame — prosecutor vs. felon. But I think it’s smarter to talk about the crimes that voters actually seem freaked out about. Like if they were really worried about Trump’s crimes, this election would never be so close to begin with.Molly: Yeah, I don’t disagree. She can start with the whole “I know Donald Trump’s type” shtick, sure, but then segue into her explanation of what it means to be smart on crime, which should resonate with a lot of the more moderate voters Democrats need to bring on board. (Obviously, the risk there is turning off those same young voters.)Dana: That is true. Democrats are often afraid to be tough on crime, and on the border, but there is really no downside to either, particularly from Black and Latino voters. (White liberals may be another matter.) Molly, as resident young person, do you see young voters actually showing up for Harris? Is the TikTok enthusiasm real?Molly: I see them showing up for Harris more than for Biden! Which is to say, there’s probably still a problem. But she can more easily thread the needle on Gaza-Israel, a big issue for young voters, than he could. And she’s also just younger herself. The feeling of change in the air — having a candidate drop off the ticket this late is nothing if not change! — could shake off some of the hopelessness or nihilism folks were feeling, and get them engaged again.Catherine: As a resident former young person, I remain skeptical of how big a role younger voters will play in this race but more hopeful than I was when Biden helmed the ticket!Dana: It would be contribution enough if the kids don’t blow up the convention in Chicago.Catherine: As an aside on the youths thing: I reported from a Harris fundraiser over the weekend and chatted with the Kamala stans. Quite a few said what they liked most about Harris was that she “appealed to young people.” Which was funny because the fans themselves were overwhelmingly retirees. (But also this was in the Berkshires, where the median age is probably 75.)Molly: LOL, yeah, it’s like how everyone talking about “brat summer” and the coconut-pilling as a Gen Z phenomenon are 35-year-olds working in media.Catherine: Yup.Dana: What about Biden? In the background, or is there a role?Molly: In the background, I hope! Let the VP pick be the (probably) White guy who’s at front and center with Harris.Catherine: I’m with Molly. Biden can be supportive in the background. Keep the government functioning and avoid major crises. That will be a huge contribution in and of itself.Dana: The crime and border issues are part of a larger debate about whether there’s tension between rallying the base and reaching out to swing voters. My own view is that Harris at this point need only do the latter. The base is sufficiently motivated by finally having hope of beating Trump.Catherine: I agree with Dana. The party is (unusually) unified behind her. The most important thing is to appeal to more moderate/independent voters, including suburban women who are turned off by Trump (and more recently, Vance).Dana: So, Biden keeps the country going strong and hopefully securing a Gaza deal, while Harris has her brat summer and talks crime, and while everybody keeps calling Trump/Vance weird, because they are. Old and young, liberal and moderate turn out for Harris and the republic is saved. I think we’ve cracked it!Molly: I can get behind that. Keep young/youngish people hyped that they finally feel something besides a dull dread by maintaining the fresh and vibrant tone in their messaging they’ve so far cultivated. On the substance of the messaging, don’t bend over backward to win those young people. Focus on the swing voters.Dana: Also, The Post should send all of us on reporting trips to the Berkshires.Molly: Woohoo! They’re calling this period of excitement “the Harris Honeymoon,” and that’s fair enough. But, what, 50 percent of marriages last? I’ll take those odds.Dana: True enough, and we could yet have a Trump-Vance divorce, if only Trump could ever admit screwing up.Catherine: Wouldn’t be Trump’s first."
WaPo_68,WADA says it’s stuck in the middle. It’s there for a reason.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/wada-usada-chinese-swimmers-doping-allegations/,2024-07-31 21:46:02.835095,,"PARIS — A year ago, a Czech cyclist training in the United States tested positive for a banned substance that entered her system because she was handling a prescription medicine for her dying dog. Anti-doping authorities announced the results of the test — just as they announced there would be no penalty.Also last year, an American sprinter borrowed training sleeves from a friend to wear over an injured hamstring. The sleeves contained a banned substance. After an investigation concluded the sprinter shouldn’t be penalized, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the positive test anyway.In 2020, an American boxer tested positive for two banned substances that her partner was taking. An investigation determined the drugs entered her system through sex. She was exonerated in time to compete in the Tokyo Olympics the following summer. The positive tests still were disclosed.“As it stands, the WADA rules dictate that even if a positive test is proven to be caused by contamination, national anti-doping agencies must find a violation, disqualify results, and make a public announcement,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement issued Tuesday night.Which gets us to the Paris Olympics. And the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for banned substances three years ago. And the results that weren’t announced.There is all-out war between two agencies that are supposed to pull on the same end of the rope. It’s not going away. If anything, it’s escalating.“The politicization of Chinese swimming continues with this latest attempt by the media in the United States to imply wrongdoing on the part of WADA and the broader anti-doping community,” WADA said in a lengthy statement issued Tuesday. “As we have seen over recent months, WADA has been unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that.”Ya’ gotta feel for them, don’t ya'?The story has not stopped the Olympic swim meet in its tracks, not hardly. That’s largely because the Chinese swimmers have been held off the top of the podium — so the anthem hasn’t once filled La Defense Arena. After winning 10 golds in Tokyo — second behind the United States’ 12 — and 20 medals overall, China has just two silvers and two bronzes here as the meet approaches its midpoint.On Tuesday night, Qin Haiyang — the reigning world champion in both the men’s 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes — failed to reach the final of the latter event, in which he holds the world record. This after he finished seventh in the 100 earlier in the meet. Wednesday morning, Xu Jiayu, who won one of China’s silvers in the 100 backstroke, failed to even show up for his heat in the 200 back. No immediate reason was given.It’s dangerous to consider those results and actions and conclude, “The Chinese must be missing something they relied on in Tokyo.” But WADA’s combination of inaction and secrecy has only bolstered such speculation.Forget the “politicization of Chinese swimming.” This is a mess of WADA’s own making. And it’s important to clean it up — not just for the Paris Games, but for faith in the global system to ensure clean international competition going forward.The American media WADA refers to is the New York Times, which reported earlier Tuesday that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive for banned substances — in this case, a hardcore steroid — but blamed it on contaminated meat. (One of those swimmers is on the Olympic team here.) But it also could and should include the German outlet ARD, which with the Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine leading up to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and that Chinese anti-doping authorities blamed on contamination in a hotel kitchen, an explanation that WADA accepted but didn’t announce. Last week, ARD further reported that those swimmers didn’t all stay at the same hotel.“A fundamental question at the heart of any claimed contamination case, which WADA refuses to answer in these cases, is what was the source of the positives?” Tygart’s latest statement said. “The fact that WADA accepted these excuses and declined to enforce its own rules is a failure of the system.”All this led to saber-rattling across the Atlantic. On Tuesday, a bipartisan congressional delegation announced legislation that would withhold the U.S.’s contribution to WADA’s budget — a $3.4-million contribution to a roughly $50-million annual budget.The swept-under-the-rug Chinese positives could make WADA seem toothless. And to the athletes who swam in Tokyo and are competing here against 11 of those swimmers, it is — regardless of China’s poor performance in the pool thus far.But tell that to the scores of athletes WADA has suspended over the years, even those who have claimed inadvertent ingestion. There’s Shelby Houlihan, the American record-holder in the women’s 1,500 meters who is missing her second Olympics after a positive test for the steroid nandrolone — that she blamed on a tainted burrito. There’s Issam Asinga, the Surinamese sprinter who set American high school records but is serving a four-year ban after testing positive for the banned substance GW1516, which alters how the body metabolizes fat. Isinga is suing Gatorade, which he says supplied him tainted gummies that were supposed to help with recovery.Whether you believe Houlihan or Asinga, they’re not here because WADA said they can’t be.“I just think this idea that somehow they’re soft on doping is unfair,” said Paul Greene, an American attorney who has represented athletes in doping cases for two decades. “I know from my years and years of dealing with them, if anything, they’re rigid.”What they are is inconsistent, and the reaction — particularly in the United States or from American athletes and observers — risks being horribly xenophobic. You can’t say, “Poor kid from Suriname, he should be here,” and follow it reflexively with, “We’re not going to fund you unless you suspend the Chinese.”But WADA also needs to admit that it didn’t handle the China cases properly. Beyond that, both WADA and the International Olympic Committee need to understand that the timing of the unpublicized positives — less than a year in advance of the Beijing Winter Games — makes the optics awful, quietly clearing athletes from one of the few countries eager to host future Olympics.Beyond that, the IOC must understand the threats it is making to yank the 2034 Winter Games from Salt Lake City unless Americans bow to WADA as the “supreme authority” on all things doping are laughable. Where else would they turn? Beyond that, WADA must come to the conclusion that its blended relationship with the IOC — half of the budget comes from countries around the world, the other half from the IOC — cripples its ability to police doping as an independent agency.American outcry is not the reason WADA’s structure is flawed and its actions open to suspicion. Both problems are solvable, but only if both the IOC and WADA understand that public perception matters when it comes to faith. And without faith in the system, who can be confident the competition is clean?"
WaPo_69,"For Olympic parents barred from Tokyo Games, a tangible joy in Paris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/olympian-parents-paris-olympics/,2024-07-31 21:26:02.835095,,"PARIS — Three years ago, Jim Huske and his wife, Ying, watched their 18-year-old daughter endure heartbreak and devastation on the biggest stage in the world, and there was nothing they could do. They couldn’t wrap their arms around Torri Huske and tell her everything would be okay after she finished fourth,  just 0.01 second away from a medal. They were 6,800 miles away.“It was heartbreaking when we saw that look on her face,” Jim says.The Huske family — like most everyone else — was barred from attending the Tokyo Olympics, as the world was in the final throes of the covid-19 pandemic. Those Games were held without fans, the athletes performing in empty stadiums and arenas in a made-for-TV Olympics.The most tormented people during those Olympics may be the happiest at these. Parents of second-time Olympians who yearned to be with their children at the biggest moments of their athletic lives — to console them, celebrate with them, cheer for them, comfort them, hug them — now can do all those things while taking in the majesty of Paris and the sporting splendor of the Games.“There’s only so much you can do when you’re FaceTiming and talking on the phone,” said Laura Woodhead, the mother of water polo player Dylan Woodhead, a first-time Olympian in Tokyo. “At one point, it kind of felt like a Netflix series. You’re watching this like, ‘I think he was here.’ It’s so much better in person.”Huske and his wife were side-by-side this week in Paris La Defense Arena where Huske, now 21, won gold in the women’s 100-meter butterfly, the same race that brought so much pain in Tokyo.“This is the exact opposite,” Huske said. “It’s the pinnacle … She’s still crying. But it was different. This was tears of joy.”Just two games into the men’s water polo tournament, parents from the United States had formed a tradition. “Let’s meet at the french fry statue,” someone said after the first game. And so they all know to gather outside the Aquatics Center around the sculpture of curved, interlocking bars stretching into the sky.Mimi Hooper mingled and made small talk in the dusty swelter Tuesday afternoon after her son, Johnny Hooper, and his U.S. teammates had beaten Romania. When players emerged down a dirt path, they all whooped and clapped. As they trickled into the crowd, Mimi spotted Johnny.“Here’s my boy,” Mimi said. Johnny leaned down and wrapped his arms around his mother.In team sports, parents missed two families in Tokyo. Traveling to tournaments bonds parents as much as players. Some of them met when their sons were 12. They know one another’s quirks.Tuesday afternoon, Laura Woodhead clanged a cowbell, passed out horns and waved a flag emblazoned with Olympic rings and, “Allez Woodhead.” Mimi could barely speak. Laura tells her she’s the calmest parent there. Mimi said “terrified” is a better descriptor.“I get nervous,” Mimi said. “I’m terrible. If I had a choice, I’d sit by myself.”Traveling the world to watch their children compete at the highest level is not new. But the Olympics are different from global championships. Woodhead has ventured to three or four venues in a day, and some in her traveling party scored tickets to the men’s 100-meter final on the track.“You get to see it all,” Laura said. “When you go to the world championships of water polo, you’re just watching water polo.”The water polo is still the best part. When Dylan ambled past the french fry statue, he spotted a pack of high school friends who had made the trip and stood behind the American bench. “You guys were loud, bro!” Dylan said, exchanging daps and hugs. “I loved it!”Dylan’s brother, Quinn, is in Paris as a first alternate, and his sister, Ella, was one of the last cuts for the women’s team. They can discuss strategy and how Dylan fits into the team. Laura just wanted to give him a hug.“That’s my job,” Laura said.After the Tokyo Games, Johnny Hooper went to work and considered leaving water polo behind. “Some people — including probably me — guilted him into it,” Mimi said, chuckling. “Like, ‘I didn’t get to go watch at the Olympics!’ He was like, ‘Okay, let me do one more time.’ ”Some moments will remain missing, like blank pages in a book. Mimi was born in Japan, and her side of the family still lives there. She had planned to make Tokyo a transcontinental family celebration.“My mom’s in her late 80s, and she thought this was going to be the last time she would see him in an Olympics,” Mimi said. “It was really hard. She lost that opportunity.”No athlete reaches the Olympics alone. In the background are families who pour in time, money and support. They go to 7 a.m. swim meets and drive across the country to youth tournaments. They lift their children after disappointing losses so they can celebrate all the emotional wins.Born in England, Terry Davison was a youth soccer coach in Inverness, Fla., when his sons became interested in rowing. “I didn’t know one end of the oar from the other,” he said with a laugh. But he turned a shack with a few broken down boats into a promising rowing club, coaching his sons in this foreign sport.Ben Davison eventually qualified for the Tokyo Games with the U.S. men’s eight. His parents were crushed they couldn’t attend. They watched the Olympic competition from a watch party organized by USRowing at Universal Studies, saddened to see the U.S. boat finish in fourth place, just off the medal podium. Sarah Davison packed a care package that included a Benjamin Bunny children’s book they read together when Ben was younger.“When they’re sad and your heart aches with them — I still love him the same no matter what,” said Sarah Davison, “ … Yeah, it hurts. It really does.”The Davison booked their Paris travel plans long before Ben secured his Olympic spot. “Nonrefundable,” Terry said with a laugh. “I was sweating a bit on it. But you know, that’s it. I had my money on him.”The American boat made it to Paris and will race in the men’s eight finals on Thursday at Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, located 15 miles west of Paris.“Try to tell Ben Davison that fourth in the Olympics is good. He's not having it,” the father said. “He was upset. But we're back.”When Cindy Rusher was coming into town last week, she told her husband, “I want to slow down time for the next 10 days.” Their daughter Alie rowed for the U.S. team at the Tokyo Games, and their son Ben is now here competing in Paris.“You realize it's a moment in time,” Cindy said, “and it's not necessarily always going to happen every four years. … I just I feel like I'm every day trying to appreciate everything that's going on.”They know better than most the enduring quality of an Olympic memory. Both Cindy and Jack rowed at the Summer Olympics in 1988 and ’92. At both, they had their own parents. Jack’s 81-year-old grandfather traveled to Seoul, even though he was in a wheelchair.Alie is here supporting her brother, knowing his Olympic experience will be the inverse of hers in so many ways.“We’ve had a few discussions and just wistfully wishing what could have been,” Jack said.The whole family began making Paris plans a year ago. They hoped Alie or Ben would make the U.S. team. If not, they figured, they’d just do a family vacation. So there’s 12 of them sharing a house in Paris this week, experiencing a non-covid Olympics together, making up for lost memories wherever possible.“Most of the athletes have big groups of fans,” Jack says, “because I think everyone has a pent-up desire to make up for what was missed in Tokyo.”For the Robertses of Buchanan, Mich., BMX cycling always has been synonymous with family. They all pitched in at the bike park an extended family member owned the next town over, just across the border in Indiana. The arrangement was particularly sweet for Hannah, the youngest of the family’s four daughters.“We all worked,” her mother Betty Roberts said. “She got to ride.”Under blazing sun Tuesday afternoon, Betty and her husband, Rick, sat in Row 18 of the BMX stadium at Place de la Concorde, directly across from Olympic rings hanging above the freestyle course. The Eiffel Tower loomed to their right. Behind them sat Hannah’s three sisters, brother-in-law and two nephews. They watched as Hannah qualified for the medal round, trying to improve on her silver medal in Tokyo.The family had watched back in Buchanan, surrounded by nearly 2,000 people at a watch party in town commons. NBC had set up a two-way video feed so Hannah and her parents could see one another during competition.“It was not quite the same. At all,” Betty said. “Here, I can go down and I can see her. There, I couldn’t touch her. You couldn’t give her a hug.”The distance was especially hard in Tokyo. Hannah broke her foot a month before the Tokyo Games. Betty is a nurse, and she desperately wished she could have helped. “You can’t be there,” Betty said. “You can’t encourage her, you can’t see what’s wrong.”“The last Olympics, I was going to take my dad,” Rick said. “He was suffering from cancer. He lost his battle in between. That was in the head.”Rick and Betty were there Tuesday as Hannah dropped in. There were no nerves, only excitement. “C’mon, show me a flair!” Rick said, referencing a 180 backflip Hannah had been the first woman to execute — at age 12. Rick thrust his fist in the air as Hannah finished a flawless run, a 91.80 score.All of a sudden, the public address speakers bellowed, “Shoutout to Rick Roberts, who is the house!” Rick laughed and tipped his cap. Darryl Nau, the stadium announcer who has become a family friend over the years, had asked Roberts if her dad would be there.The announcement was another reminder of what they had missed in Tokyo. The BMX circuit is a “very small family,” Rick said. They chatted with a Mongoose rep and said hello to old friends. Many professionals train or compete at the bike park near the Roberts’ home, and Betty hates to see them spend money on a hotel.“All of these women have at one point stayed at our house,” Betty said, pointing to the course.When the horn concluded Roberts’s second run, she stopped atop a box. Betty leaned forward and screamed, “Woo!” Rick rose with his full 6-foot-3 frame and raised his hands. Roberts would later say she never spotted her family, but somehow she tapped her heart with both hands and pointed directly at them.“I wanted to wear a Hawaiian shirt so it’d be easier for Hannah to see us,” Rick said, playfully side-eyeing Betty. “But somebody wouldn’t let me.”The Huske family watched their daughter swim in the Tokyo Games from their Arlington, Va., home, along with her coach Evan Stiles and a handful of friends. They’d traveled the world to watch her swim, and there was no way they were missing Paris.They watched her race from the stands. The race was tight and Huske was trailing until the last couple of mighty strokes. Jim noticed first. “She did it!” he yelled to his wife. “She did it!”After the medal ceremony, Huske made a beeline to her parents in the stands, falling into Ying’s arms. The two rocked side to side.“Oh, my goodness,” Ying would later say. “That's the moment that I'm so glad I didn't miss.”Let others take in the Louvre and Musée d’Orsay. The Huskes are spending each day at the Olympic pool as their daughter takes aim at even more medals, close enough to reach out and touch.“It’s magic,” Jim said. “There’s no other way to say it. Magic.”"

No Olympic rings hung above the pool, nor were there daily reminders that the Paris Games were right around the corner.“There’s not a whole lot of discussion about it,” said Todd DeSorbo, the decorated Virginia swimming coach.Still, every single day at the Paris La Defense Arena, Virginia swimmers promise to be everywhere at these Summer Games. One hundred eighty-eight countries will be represented in the Olympic swimming pool; Virginia can lay claim to more swimmers than 167 of them. The eventual medal count surely will be even more impressive.They already have a small collection of shiny souvenirs to take back to Charlottesville. Gretchen Walsh took silver in the women’s 100-meter butterfly Sunday, and she and Kate Douglass were part of the 4x100 freestyle relay team that won silver on the opening night of the meet.Each day of this Paris competition should feature at least one swimmer with ties to Virginia, from graduates Douglass and Paige Madden to sisters Gretchen and Alex Walsh to 17-year-old U.Va. commit Thomas Heilman, who will be the youngest U.S. male swimmer in an Olympics since Michael Phelps in 2000. Emma Weber, a 20-year-old breaststroker, is here as well, as is her Cavaliers teammate Aimee Canny, who competed for her native South Africa. Oh, and the coach of the U.S. women’s team? That’s DeSorbo, who arrived in Charlottesville in 2017 and built the Cavaliers’ program into a powerhouse that has claimed four straight NCAA titles.“I knew that the University of Virginia had the potential to be where we are today,” DeSorbo said. “I was confident that we could get to this point. I just didn't know how quickly we could do it.”It started with Douglass, who has blossomed into the best all-around swimmer on the U.S. team — a podium favorite in the 200-meter individual medley, 200 breaststroke and probably one or two more relays. (She qualified for the 100 freestyle, too, but decided to drop that event and focus on her stronger races.)“Todd DeSorbo came in with a lot of energy and a lot of positivity,” NBC analyst Rowdy Gaines said. “And he was a good salesman. He sold his first recruit, Kate Douglass … and said, ‘This is what we’re going to do, and you’re going to lead the way.’”Douglass is indomitable in breaststroke and freestyle — two strokes with only the faintest of relations. Outside of youth meets, it’s rare to see a swimmer excel in both, which makes Douglass a hybrid between a unicorn and Swiss army knife.“They’re pretty rare. They’re pretty unique,” DeSorbo said. “She does that at a level that nobody’s ever done it before.”Douglass, 22, took bronze at the Tokyo Games in the 200 IM and since has grown into one of the sport’s biggest stars and the backbone of the American squad. At last year’s world championships, she bagged five medals, including gold in the 200 IM.“I obviously had confidence in myself, but it was definitely scary just because I knew a lot of people had expectations for me,” Douglass said at the U.S. trials last month in Indianapolis, where an image of her measuring 84 feet tall and 214 feet long adorned Lucas Oil Stadium. “A lot of people had planned trips to Paris, and I was like, ‘I haven’t made it yet, but hopefully that will be fun.’”Those trials had the feel of a school reunion with the Cavaliers taking turns on the medal podium. Gretchen Walsh, 21, narrowly missed the Tokyo Games but is having a breakout year. At the U.S. trials, she set a world record in the 100 butterfly with a time of 55.18 seconds, smashing Sarah Sjostrom’s mark of 55.48 from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. She set an Olympic record in the race in the Paris semifinal Saturday and then finished second to American teammate Torri Huske in Sunday’s final, just 0.04 seconds away from gold. Walsh will also compete in the 50 and 100 freestyle here, and possibly another relay.Her sister, Alex, will go head-to-head with Douglass in the 200 IM on Friday, the same event in which she won silver in Tokyo — just 0.13 seconds away from gold.“The expectations that we have coming from U-Va., we placed great expectations on ourselves,” said, Alex, 22. “We have a lot of pressure to perform. That’s our team culture, but we always rise to that.”That is no accident. DeSorbo saw the potential to build a program that would be competitive with any school in the country and also serve as an Olympic training ground.“I remember Todd said the goal for this program is to make little girls and boys want to grow up to swim at U-Va.,” Douglass said. “I feel like when I was younger, Stanford was the place to be, and I feel like a lot of people had Stanford shirts. He wanted to make that U-Va.’ s thing, and we’ve done that. And there are all these little kids who want to swim at U-Va., and I think that’s super cool.”These days, the NCAA season, with its 25-yard pool, serves as training of sorts for the 50-meter long-course season, which means major meets and international competition are always looming on the horizon for Virginia swimmers. Until last month’s U.S. trials, for that matter, Gretchen Walsh was saddled with a reputation for excelling at short course, but floundering in the longer pool.Still, the dual mission is largely unspoken around the pool deck: DeSorbo said he doesn’t need to remind anyone, and the Olympic success of Douglass and Alex Walsh — and Leah Smith before them — has helped set goals and expectations.“The last thing I want them to do is to constantly be thinking about the goal of making the Olympics,” DeSorbo said. “If you overthink it — we have a saying: Overthinking kills your happiness. I don’t really want them thinking about it. I keep telling them: ‘Let me think about it. … I know the goal. It’s my goal for you, too. I’m going to do everything I can to put you in the best possible position.’”And these Olympics may be just the beginning.“The hope is to kind of continue that trend and put even more people on the team in L.A. in four years,” DeSorbo said."
WaPo_71,The Orioles didn’t make a splash at the trade deadline. Did they do enough?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/baltimore-orioles-mlb-trade-deadline/,2024-07-31 21:17:02.835095,,"The Baltimore Orioles entered this year’s trade deadline in much the same position as they entered last year’s. Their potent and low-cost young lineup had them firmly in postseason contention. They needed pitching to give themselves a chance to turn a strong regular season into a lengthy postseason run. And this year, like last year, they got some. But this year, like last year, when it felt like a top-of-the-rotation star or a game-shortening bullpen ace might anoint them as the team to beat in the American League, they did not get the top pitching names available.But in a market defined by the exorbitant cost of starting pitching, they did get some. They acquired Zach Eflin from the Tampa Bay Rays without touching their most heralded prospects, in so doing adding a veteran starter with a 4.11 ERA who will be in the middle of their rotation next year, too. With a young pitching staff still establishing full-season stamina, that helps.They acquired Trevor Rogers from the Marlins, grabbing a former first-round pick and 2021 all-star who will be under their control through 2026. Rogers, who has a 4.23 ERA in 80 career starts, accumulated those numbers in a Marlins organization that has struggled to turn talent into stars. The Orioles have a much better track record of improving players at the big league level by honing their pitch mix and usage. They have reason to believe Rogers can improve, and they bet infield prospect Connor Norby and outfielder Kyle Stowers they will be able to help Rogers do it.They also traded for two Phillies relievers, Seranthony Dominguez and Gregory Soto, in separate deals. Both provide depth. Dominguez has explosive stuff. That deal cost them veteran outfielder Austin Hays, whose production against lefties the Orioles sought to replace by trading for right-handed outfielders Eloy Jiménez, the once-promising, oft-injured Chicago White Sox slugger, and Austin Slater. Neither of those deals cost the Orioles top prospects. Neither of them is a sure thing to establish himself as a key part of this Orioles offense. But one or both of them could certainly help.For an exciting young team still waiting for its first deep October push — and a fan base hungry to see it — the haul was not exactly blinding in its shine. But the Orioles were by no means alone among contenders when it comes to making no star-studded splash. The two most prominent starters traded, Yusei Kikuchi and Jack Flaherty, were both moved in deals that stirred skepticism: Kikuchi’s expiring contract and four-plus ERA required the Houston Astros to part with three near-ready prospects. As for Flaherty, whose value was high because of an uncharacteristically sturdy season, the Athletic reported late Tuesday night that the New York Yankees had backed out of a deal for him amid concerns about his medical reports. When it came to the starting pitching market, seemingly, there were no sure things.The problem for the Orioles, at least when it comes to the perception of their deadline, is they have now spent two deadlines and an offseason clinging to the kind of high-quality prospects that could pry a sure thing away from a team reluctant to deal it. Their deal for ace Corbin Burnes this offseason, for example, garnered them an ace in exchange for DL Hall and Joey Ortiz, one of their many infield prospects who, due entirely to quantity and not to his quality, they simply have not missed.Were the Detroit Tigers ever going to deal Tarik Skubal? Maybe not. Would he have been worth unloading multiple members of the Orioles top prospect list to secure an ace for the next two and a half seasons? Maybe. Maybe not. Would A’s closer Mason Miller or now-Padres Tanner Scott and Jason Adam been able to stay healthy long enough to transform their struggling bullpen for years to come? Maybe. Maybe not. But is a bullpen that will enter the postseason relying on Craig Kimbrel and Yennier Cano to close out games be deep and dominant enough to win in October? Their decision to pry Dominguez and Soto from the Philadelphia Phillies bullpen instead of dealing for a proven closer means it will have to be.That being said, parting with treasured prospects like Jackson Holliday and Samuel Basallo — both currently in Baseball America’s top five — should never be taken lightly. And again, the Orioles were not alone in their reluctance to do so: Baseball America reported Tuesday that for the first time since 2014, no members of its Top 100 prospects list changed hands at the deadline.And while Baltimore has plenty of options in the middle infield that made Norby expendable in the deal for Rogers, a corner infielder like prospect Coby Mayo (also, like so many Orioles prospects, raking at Class AAA Norfolk) could help them, though Ryan Mountcastle still has two years of arbitration before Baltimore would really have to pay him.But therein lies another fascinating aspect of this year’s Orioles deadline: For the first time in the Mike Elias era, and certainly in part due to the recent beginning of the David Rubenstein era, the Orioles seemed to have money with which to maneuver. For example, they will owe Eflin $18 million in 2025, a salary that would have made him the highest-paid player on this Orioles roster. And in Jiménez, whose contract expires after this season, they did something that would have been unthinkable for them even a year ago: They absorbed another team’s salary dump to take a chance on a few months of a once-promising young player who might never help them much at all. It should be noted, however, that the White Sox did send an undisclosed amount of cash the Orioles way to help pay down the rest of Jiménez’s salary.As of early Monday morning, Elias had yet to address the media about his team’s deadline moves. Exactly how much payroll flexibility he had for the rest of this season and into next season is not clear. Burnes will become a free agent this offseason, and while all indications are that the Scott Boras client will have plenty of enticing reasons to leave in free agency, perhaps it is less of a sure thing than it once was that the Orioles cannot compete for elite starters in that market in years to come. If so, paying for pitching rather than selling treasured young players for it might feel like a more comfortable long-term strategy. Plus, the Orioles expect dominant closer Félix Bautista to return from Tommy John surgery next year, and 2023 Cy Young candidate Kyle Bradish could be back in time for a postseason push, too.So the most immediate question, then, is whether the Orioles did enough to give themselves a chance in October this year. The window they waited so long to unlock is now wide open. Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, Jordan Westburg and Colton Cowser are all far outproducing their pre-arbitration and arbitration salaries. As recent annual juggernauts like the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies can tell them, there is no planning for the right year to make a push. The best way to win a World Series is to take advantage of every credible chance because health and fluctuating performances might mean good years that felt promised never really are.Perhaps Eflin will be the third starter the Orioles need behind Burnes and Grayson Rodriguez to help them carve through the American League in short series. Perhaps Kimbrel and Cano and Dominguez will be enough. But the Orioles deadline simply did not offer the kind of fortune-altering arms that, for example, the Padres acquired to turn their bullpen into a potential October wrecking ball.The Orioles rotation will certainly be deeper next year for their efforts, and Dominguez has a club option for next year that means Baltimore can keep the proven set-up option around for $8 million next year. And again, many of their most obvious American League challengers have not exactly turned their pitching staffs into untouchable behemoths: The Yankees, for example, watched struggling Clay Holmes blow another save Tuesday night, and do not have an obvious replacement on their roster, either.Baltimore entered this trade deadline with an imperfect roster and left with one, too. They will enter this offseason with prospect capital to spend. They will probably enter next year’s deadline with that at their disposal, too. If the right players were not available and the time was not right to splurge, then Elias & Co.'s patience will be rewarded in hindsight. But the question they will face in the meantime is a difficult one, one their unique depth of young talent has made it particularly challenging for their front office to answer: If now is not the right time, with a largely healthy and cheap young lineup and a veteran ace around for a few more months, when is?"
WaPo_72,The mutual joy of James Baldwin’s many brilliant friends,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/james-baldwin-national-portrait-gallery/,2024-07-31 21:00:02.835095,,"James Baldwin opens his 1953 essay “Stranger in the Village” by describing the disconcerting experience of finding himself in a “tiny Swiss village” in which “no black man had ever set foot.” Greeted by the bafflement of the locals, he writes, he fell back on his accumulated experience confronting the differently textured qualities of American racism, grinning in the hope that it would show him to be likable, or at least human. “This smile-and-the-world-smiles-with-you routine worked about as well in this situation as it had in the situation for which it was designed, which is to say that it did not work at all,” he writes. “They did not, really, see my smile and I began to think that, should I take to snarling, no one would notice any difference.”Baldwin’s smile, famously gap-toothed, unreservedly inviting, finds a different purchase in three photos by Bernard Gotfryd from 1965, placed near the back of the small gallery that houses “This Morning, This Evening, So Soon: James Baldwin and the Voices of Queer Resistance,” an exhibition celebrating the writer’s birthday centennial now open at the National Portrait Gallery. Baldwin poses with his friend Nina Simone: In one image, their heads touch in easy intimacy, while in another their gazes are turned toward something or someone out of frame. In each, the pair exudes a confident, mutual joy.“This Morning, This Evening, So Soon,” curated by Rhea L. Combs with the Pulitzer-winning critic Hilton Als, revels in such moments of companionship and possibility. “I think one of the things that is essential to our understanding of Baldwin is … the way in which he made families wherever he lived,” Als observes in the exhibition’s companion book. The gallery’s walls and cases testify to that attitude: here a photo of Baldwin with the actors Diana Sands and Burgess Meredith, there a set of poignant letters he exchanged in 1982 with Orilla Winfield, who had been his elementary school teacher and mentor almost half a century before. Elsewhere an elegant letter from Toni Morrison, thanking Baldwin for providing a quotation that would accompany her novel “Sula” and apologizing that Random House, her employer at the time, would not be buying his “If Beale Street Could Talk.”The show bills itself as a “collective portrait,” revealing “how his sexuality, faith, artistic curiosities and notions of masculinity — coupled with his involvement in the civil rights movement — helped define his writing and long-lasting legacy.” Studying some of the images and artifacts with this context, it is tempting to read the exhibit as a testament to Baldwin’s circle throughout the years — those who supported him, and those he directly supported in turn.The actual progression of the exhibit, however, at once undercuts and complicates that impression. Much of the Baldwin-focused material is tucked into the back of the room, behind a broad central pillar. Entering the gallery, one instead first encounters — almost trips over, really, since it is in a case that angles up from the floor — a large quilt made by Faith Ringgold in honor of the Black and queer filmmaker Marlon Riggs, who had died of AIDS not long before she made it. (A small image of Baldwin appears at the upper right. Cramped script near the bottom describes him as one of Riggs’s mentors.)On a wall nearby, there is a Lyle Ashton Harris photograph from the early 1990s of Riggs with bell hooks, their poses echoing those of Baldwin and Simone, though the companionship here feels specific to a wholly different moment. A closely cropped, grainy video of Rep. Barbara Jordan testifying in favor of the impeachment of Richard M. Nixon — part of a larger work of video art by Donald Moffett — runs on the wall opposite the entrance. As one moves through the space, Jordan’s voice presses up against and overlaps with that of Simone, singing “To Be Young, Gifted and Black” on a separate screen nearby.This crisscrossed jumble of images, individuals and forms of address can be disconcerting, especially if one comes to the exhibit in search of the more coherent narrative at which the explanatory placards sometimes seem to hint. Most of the subjects and artists are Black, and most of them were queer, too. But there is no one story here about, say, the juncture of Blackness and queerness in American art and letters. In its place, however, “This Evening, This Morning, So Soon” leaves us with a welcoming mesh of connections and contingencies, one that maintains the possibility of subsequent bonds.Nowhere in the gallery is this more evident than in the contemporary conceptual artist Glenn Ligon’s monochromatic “Untitled (Hands/Stranger in the Village),” which hangs on the column at the center, facing out. On the surface of the canvas, Ligon has printed lines from Baldwin’s own “Stranger in the Village” in clean, legible lettering. But Baldwin’s words are obscured by a mass of coal dust that covers much of the work.There is a similarly palimpsestic quality to much of the exhibit. Every object offers itself to be overwritten — but somehow also reinforced — by new communities, new action and new forms of life. No map could connect every one of these objects to every other, but their promise resides in the sometimes-unbridged spaces between them, voids as open and welcoming as the one at the center of Baldwin’s grin.National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and G streets NW. 202-633-1000. npg.si.edu.Dates: Through April 20.Prices: Free."
WaPo_73,Senators want to prevent the next Scarlett Johansson AI voice fiasco,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/senators-want-prevent-next-scarlett-johansson-ai-voice-fiasco/,2024-07-31 21:00:02.835095,,"Happy Wednesday! I’ve now been your newsletter host for over three years. Send anniversary news tips to: cristiano.lima@washpost.com. Today:Senators want to prevent the next Scarlett Johansson AI voice fiascoActress Scarlett Johansson sparked national debate in May when she accused start-up OpenAI of copying her voice to create a conversational artificial intelligence system.OpenAI said it “never intended” to mimic Johansson’s voice, and records show that the company hired a different voice actress to generate the tool.But a bipartisan group of senators are trying to head off the next Johansson-esque episode, unveiling legislation that would prohibit people from making unauthorized AI replicas without the consent of whomever they mimic.Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on Wednesday are formally introducing an updated version of the Nurture Originals, Foster Art and Keep Entertainment Safe Act, or No Fakes Act, a major entry in the congressional debate over AI guardrails.The bill, initially unveiled as a discussion draft late last year, would give people a federal property right to approve the use of their voice, appearance or likeness — and expose those who create or distribute an unauthorized replica to legal liability.In an interview with Tech Brief, Coons said the right would be afforded to not only celebrities like Johansson but also everyday people like “a college basketball coach or my grandmother.”“It's my hope that we can get it out of committee before the end of this Congress. At that point, we'll be left looking to see if there's any [legislative] vehicle that might still be moving,” he said.The revamped proposal includes major changes, which Coons said were the result of months of “challenging” negotiations with “very sharply opposed interest groups” representing performers and artists and those representing tech platforms.Notably, the updated legislation is being rolled out with the support of three major groups representing performers, actors and musicians: the Motion Picture Association, Recording Industry Association of America and SAG-AFTRA. While few from the tech sector are endorsing the bill, Coons said the new compromise drew “non-objection” from several major platforms, without elaborating.Digital rights groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation have spoken out against the initial bill, which they said would infringe on free speech by forcing platforms to take down replicas protected under the First Amendment.Those groups have also expressed concern that performers and artists could abuse the new right to try to get protected speech they dislike taken down from the internet by claiming it violates someone's replica rights.Lawmakers have sought to tackle those concerns by exempting constitutionally protected forms of digital replicas from the bill, including for satire, documentary use or broadcasting.Coons said some groups pushed for a broad exception for replicas of “public interest,” but he was concerned that would “swallow up” the legislation and “essentially say that the bill doesn't have any value.” He said the existing exemptions “should be more than broad enough to protect those groups and those interests that wanted to make sure that it didn't impact free expression.”“We actually didn’t move that much from the discussion draft because we felt that [it] was mostly hitting the sweet spot” on the free speech protections, a Coons aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the topic.X suspends ‘White Dudes for Harris’ account after massive fundraiser (Trisha Thadani, Will Oremus and Eva Dou)China wants to start a national internet ID system (New York Times)SEC drops claims about 10 tokens in its Binance suit (Axios)Senate passes landmark bills to protect children online, raising pressure on House (Cristiano Lima-Strong)Lawmakers want to carve out intimate AI deepfakes from Section 230 immunity (The Verge)OpenAI rolls out voice mode after delaying it for safety reasons (Gerrit De Vynck)Amazon pushes fast delivery into rural areas in challenge to post office (Wall Street Journal)How YouTube took over our television screens (New York Times)Google taps AI to revamp costly health-care push marred by flops (Bloomberg News)Google’s Anthropic AI deal gets closer British regulator scrutiny (Bloomberg News)Spain fines Booking.com $448 million for abusing dominant position (Reuters)Meta to pay record $1.4 billion to settle Texas facial recognition suit (Naomi Nix)British election body failed to protect voter data before Chinese cyberattack, watchdog says (Financial Times)Apple says Safari protects your privacy.

WaPo_74,"Rebuilding from horror, U.S. team doctors sought to earn gymnasts’ trust",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/usa-gymnastics-team-doctors-marcia-faustin-ellen-casey/,2024-07-31 22:55:02.864917,,"PARIS — The U.S. women’s gymnastics team has dazzled during the Paris Olympics. Quite literally, since the gymnasts won team gold Tuesday night while wearing a red, white and blue leotard with 9,929 Swarovski crystals. Even from the upper levels of Bercy Arena, you can’t miss them. The women sparkle and shine.The same could be said for the two U.S. team co-head physicians. Dressed in basic blue, those women, too, possess a golden touch in their roles. During the first day of the women’s qualification, Marcia Faustin, known as “Dr. Marcy” by her patients, moved herself to sit down on the floor and speak with Simone Biles as the greatest gymnast of all time dealt with a calf issue. Then on Tuesday, as Sunisa Lee prepared to compete in the last rotation, NBC cameras spotted Dr. Ellen Casey in the background, ready to serve her crystal-clad patients if needed.Since 2019, Faustin and Casey have shared the role of USA Gymnastics team doctor. That title. Those four words bring back waves of visceral memories of horrific sins. The previous team doctor will spend the rest of his life behind bars for sexually abusing the gymnasts and athletes who were in his care. So that title comes with so much history, so much pain. And yet these days, it also seems so different.Faustin could be seen wiping away Kayla DiCello’s tears after an injury at the U.S. Olympic trials ended her Paris dream, and hugging Lee when the reigning all-around Olympic champion returned from complications stemming from a kidney issue.“She’s like my saving angel,” Lee said about Faustin, following the 2023 U.S. Classic. “When I was going through all of it, she was the first person I called, and she’s been staying with me throughout the whole thing.”Because most of the doctors’ work happens away from the cameras, the shift also is happening as Casey makes a gymnast’s parent feel included in medical discussions, and when she shares direct and honest feedback with coaches.“To show up, you have to have equal parts … empathy, as well as your medical and scientific knowledge,” Casey told me during a joint interview with the doctors ahead of the Paris Olympics. “Without one or the other, you’re not doing the job.”Both Casey and Faustin have full-time jobs outside of the gymnastics team. Casey, a former collegiate gymnast, is a sports medicine physician in New York City. And Faustin, a gymnast throughout her youth and a former Division-I track and field athlete, is in family and sports medicine at UC Davis in California. Together, they’ve worked to rehabilitate the reputation of their field by building trust with the athletes, their families and coaches. It has taken patience, knowing they would have to work on restoring confidence with a community that had utterly lost faith in the medical profession.“We wanted to try to change that narrative and to really gain the trust, especially of the athletes first and foremost and their team around them,” Faustin said. “As physicians, as human beings, we want people to know that we care for them. We want them to know that we’re in their corner.”Casey added: “[It] was just heartbreaking to see all of the hurt and the lack of trust, understandably, that was there. And to try to be a small part of changing that, felt like something that was really compelling to do.”There’s safety in that title now, a sense that the world’s best gymnasts are being respected and cared for as more than just replaceable pint-size powerhouses. Casey saw Jade Carey as a young adult who confessed she wasn’t feeling well on the biggest night of her life, and might need extra care ahead of the team final. Three years ago in Tokyo, Faustin saw Biles, one of the many survivors of abuse from the previous doctor, as a woman who needed a break. Also, Faustin saw Lee just like all of the other patients in her clinic, concerned and searching for solutions. Even an elite athlete needs a medical advocate. And, as it appeared, even an Olympic gold medalist can get misdiagnosed.A year ago, Lee woke up one day with swollen ankles. The next morning, the swelling had moved to her fingers, and face and throughout her body. She was told by a different doctor that it was just allergies, but Lee distrusted the diagnosis and called Faustin in California. Faustin then reached out to Casey, and the two talked about next steps. On their prompting, Lee underwent testing that revealed two kidney diseases. So last August at the U.S. Classic, as Lee embraced Faustin following her performance on the beam, she was hugging more than just a doctor, but her “saving angel.”The visuals of Faustin and the gymnasts are particularly striking; the image of a Black female doctor caring for some of America’s best athletes. When young Black girls watch gymnastics, they may dream of becoming the next Simone Biles. However, they should also see a path in possibly becoming the next Dr. Marcy.“My reasoning for even wanting to do this and be in this space,” Faustin said. “We can help inspire other people to also do the same.”So look closer, beyond all that glitter from the crystals and the sparkle from the gold medal winning performances. Notice the doctors dressed in drab colors, always there in the background and ready to step up when called upon. Those women are shining, too."
WaPo_75,Fact-checking the first ads in the battle to define Kamala Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/fact-checker-trump-harris-ads/,2024-07-31 22:38:02.864917,,"The race to define Vice President Harris is on. The likely Democratic nominee for president dropped a new biographical ad at about the same moment Donald Trump’s campaign released an attack ad framing her as “dangerously liberal.” Here’s an assessment of the claims made in each ad.This 30-second ad is heavily focused on Harris’s role in the administration to address the “root causes” of migration from three Central American countries, using a label bestowed by Republicans (“border czar”), which The Washington Post reported in 2021 that she shunned. “Republicans try to crown Harris the ‘border czar.’ She rejects the title,” the headline said. But numerous TV commentators adopted the phrase and applied it to Harris, as this video compilation shows, giving the Trump campaign an opportunity to make the label stick.“This is America’s border czar — and she’s failed us.”This voice-over is accompanied by video of Harris dancing in a colorful shirt. It attributes the label of border czar to a 2022 article in the conservative National Review, which called her “border czar” in the headline.But Harris was not in charge of immigration issues, and she certainly wasn’t a czar.In 2021, President Biden assigned Harris to take charge of the “root causes” strategy — essentially a diplomatic effort with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to stem migration from those countries. The efforts appeared to have some impact — border arrests from those countries dropped from 700,000 in the 2021 fiscal year to fewer than 500,000 in 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. The downward trend has continued in 2024. For instance, nearly 77,000 migrants from those countries crossed the border in June 2021 — and the figure dropped to 24,000 in June of this year.But the problem shifted. Migrants surged from countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti — countries that were not part of the “root causes” strategy. In June, more than 106,000 people from countries other than the three Central American countries were arrested at the border — though that is down from a peak of 239,000 in December. On June 4, Biden issued an emergency order to curb asylum access, and White House officials say illegal crossings have dropped 50 percent since then.“Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here.”The text of the ad says “over ten million illegal border crossings” — which is technically accurate — but the voice-over is false.CBP recorded about 10 million “encounters” from February 2021, after Biden took office, through June. But that does not mean all those people entered the country illegally. Some people were “encountered” numerous times as they tried to enter the country — and others (more than 4 million of the total) were expelled, mostly because of covid-related rules that have since ended.CBP has released more than 3.2 million migrants into the United States at the southern border under the Biden administration through April, the Department of Homeland Security said. These numbers, however, do not include “gotaways” — which occur when cameras or sensors detect migrants crossing the border but no one is found or no agents are available to respond. That figure could add an additional 2 million, bringing the total number of migrants arriving during Biden’s presidency to around 5 million — about half the figure the voice-over claims remained in the United States.“A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl.”The text of the ad says this happened on “Harris’s watch.”Under Biden, according to CBP statistics, overall drug seizures have dropped, especially for marijuana, but until this year increased substantially for fentanyl — the drug most responsible for overdose deaths. Both the decrease in marijuana seizures and the increase in fentanyl seizures reflect trends that started while Trump was president.Moreover, fentanyl deaths increased nearly 50 percent under Trump, rising to 95,000 from 64,000 in a 12-month period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fentanyl deaths continued to increase under Biden but have dropped in the past 12 months, so the increase under Biden is 7 percent, for a total of about 102,000 deaths.Most drugs come into the United States across the southern border with Mexico. But even a wall does not limit this illegal trade, as much of it travels through legal borders or in tunnels unaffected by visible physical barriers. Even if a wall could curb drug trafficking, it would have a minimal impact on the death toll from drug abuse. As president, Trump often touted how much seizures of drugs at the southern border had increased on his watch. This is an imperfect metric. It could mean that law enforcement is doing a better job. But more seizures also might indicate that the drug flow has increased, and that law enforcement is missing even more.The amount of fentanyl seized at the border increased under both Biden and Trump, though so far the amount jumped by a larger percentage under Trump, CBP statistics show. In Trump’s four fiscal years, the number of pounds increased 586 percent, compared with 462 percent in the first three fiscal years under Biden.“Brutal migrant crimes, and ISIS now here.”Violent crime rates, especially for homicide in large cities, have fallen sharply during Biden’s presidency, after a surge during the pandemic. The violent crime rate is believed to be near its lowest level in 50 years. So the Trump campaign is forced to cite anecdotal stories of migrants killing people.The reference to the Islamic State is sourced to a CNN report on the arrest of eight Tajik nationals “believed to have connections to ISIS.” Islamic State-Khorasan, the Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic terrorist group, is led primarily by Tajiks. The individuals were allowed into the country but they were tracked down and arrested after intelligence officials connected them to the Islamic State. They are now in federal custody and will be deported.“Do you have any plans to visit the border?”The ad then selectively clips from an interview Harris had in June 2021 with NBC’s Lester Holt during a visit to Guatemala. He twice asks her if she plans to visit the border and she answers that she will go to the border, but expresses frustration at his question.The ad clips out all her comments about planning to visit the border, her concerns about the border and her focus that day on Guatemala. It just shows viewers this highly edited exchange:The implication is that she’s dismissive of the idea. The NBC interview took place on June 8, 2021. Harris visited the border on June 25, 2021.“Kamala Harris. Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.”The ad ends with this tagline.This is a positive biographical 60-second ad that seeks to portray Harris as tough and decisive — the opposite message of the Trump ad. It begins with the voice-over saying: “The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless.”“As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars.”This is pretty self-evident — this is what prosecutors do. Harris was district attorney of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011, and the line is intended to show she cares about crime and is not “dangerously liberal.”“As California’s attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners.”As recently recounted by Fortune, during the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 Harris walked away from a nationwide settlement that would have netted California no more than $4 billion in compensation for homeowners — what she called “crumbs on the table” — and cut a deal with three major banks that won state residents $20 billion. The agreement was intended to help people stay in their homes through lower mortgage payments. In a surprise, however, more than half chose the settlement’s option to sell their homes for less than what they owned the bank, according to a 2013 report by the program’s monitor, then-professor and now-Rep. Katie Porter (D).Harris received some criticism for not seeking to charge bankers with crimes — which she acknowledged. “I too, like most Americans, am frustrated. Clearly crimes occurred and people should go to jail,” Harris told the Los Angeles Times in 2016. “But we went where the evidence took us.”“And as vice president, she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors.”Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, cast the tiebreaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, an omnibus bill that included a provision to cap the cost of insulin offered through Medicare at $35 a month. It also required the federal government to negotiate to lower the prices of some drugs — a policy shift that infuriated pharmaceutical companies.Drew Hammill, who was deputy chief of staff to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), told The Fact Checker that Harris “was a key player in securing the necessary votes to pass the IRA. The vice president helped will the legislation into existence and was an important advocate in securing the insulin provisions.” When Harris first ran for president in 2020, she pledged she would “stop pharmaceutical companies from price-gouging patients by setting a fair price for what they can charge for prescription drugs.”“This campaign is about who we fight for. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act.”The ad then shifts to excerpts from Harris’s first campaign rally, in a Milwaukee suburb, where she tried to frame the election as a choice between the future and the past.The key factual claims are that Trump wants to “give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act.”Trump has not detailed specific tax plans, except for eliminating taxes on tips, but privately he has expressed interest in cutting corporate tax rates further if he is reelected, according to a Washington Post report. (His 2017 tax bill significantly cut corporate tax rates.) Congressional Republicans have also expressed interest in corporate tax cuts to increase U.S. competitiveness, according to another Post report. Trump also has dangled tax breaks to wealthy donors in exchange for campaign contributions, the report said.As for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Trump was frustrated in his first term that he could not terminate the law. In 2023, he suggested he would again make an effort, posting on social media: “I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!” But in 2024, Trump has mostly remained silent on his plans for the law — which remains popular and a rallying point for Democrats.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"
WaPo_76,"Far-right rioters attack U.K. police, mosque amid false claims on stabbings",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/southport-stabbing-riot-misinformation/,2024-07-31 22:30:02.864917,,"LONDON — Rioters attacked police and stormed a mosque in a seaside town in northwestern England, after far-right networks on social media spread misinformation about a mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class that killed three young girls and critically wounded seven others.Police said the riot in Southport on Tuesday night was stoked in part by social media posts that incorrectly alleged that the stabbing was perpetrated by a recent asylum seeker who had arrived in Britain by illegally crossing the English Channel on a raft.Amid reported chants of “We want our country back,” rioters pelted police with bricks, injuring as many as 50 officers and sending 27 to hospitals. The rioters also smashed the windows of a mosque, torched vehicles and looted a shop.The ugly violence, on the same day the town was holding a peaceful heart-rending vigil for the dead and injured girls, stunned Britain, where the stabbings have been round-the-clock news.Shortly before lunchtime on Monday, an assailant attacked a children’s dance class on the first day of summer vacation. Three girls have died — Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, ages 6 to 9. Five children and two adults remain in critical condition.Police are searching for a motive but say the attack does not appear related to terrorism.The 17-year-old suspect, arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, was born in Britain — in Cardiff, Wales — police stressed. The BBC and Financial Times reported that his parents were originally from Rwanda.Because of his age, his name has not been released by authorities. But police confirmed on Tuesday that a name circulating on social media in connection with the case was incorrect.“There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” police said in a statement.Police identified the rioters as supporters of the English Defense League, a now-disbanded organization of anti-Islam agitators and soccer hooligans, who still gather often in raw, sometimes violent protests.Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said “a number of arrests were made” on Tuesday night and that further investigation is underway.Patrick Hurley, Southport’s member of Parliament, emphasized that the melee was staged not by locals but “beered-up thugs” who were “using the horrific incident on Monday … for their own political purposes.”The former de facto leader of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, issued denials on social media, writing: “There’s has been no EDL for over a decade.” But in a video seen more than 3 million times since he posted it on Tuesday around 9 p.m., he argued that “anger is justified” in Southport, because the British authorities have “opened our borders,” resulting in “children being butchered and murdered.”“You care more for Afghanis, Somalis, Eritreans, Syrians, Pakistanis,” he shouted, red faced. “They’re a danger to us.”(Robinson’s whereabouts are unknown since he fled Britain on Sunday night, on the eve of unrelated contempt-of-court proceedings.)Hours after Monday’s stabbings, a false claim about the suspect’s identity was posted on an obscure X account and amplified by prominent far-right figures. Even though the social media company tacked a “community note” to the original post and eventually removed it, the claim went viral.“It looks like the tweet has been deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it’s a potentially Islamophobic piece of propaganda,” said Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at the University of Loughborough and expert in the spread of online misinformation.According to X’s analytics, the original post received at least 1.7 million views before it was removed. Videos repeating the claim were shared by Andrew Tate, an American-British former kickboxing champion who has built a popular personal brand around hyper-masculinity, and Laurence Fox, an actor turned right-wing activist. Their posts received around 17 million views between them, according to X’s data.Chadwick traced the original claim to a website called Channel 3 Now News, which he said had the hallmarks of a misinformation site run for political or commercial motives, if not both. “It looks like a news website, feels like a news website, but of course it isn’t — it’s based off a WordPress template,” he said, after examining its underlying code, which is publicly available.According to Chadwick, the claim spread quickly online for a combination of reasons: Emotions were high as people sought information in the aftermath of a gruesome attack, the claim was charged, and content restrictions on X have been loosened since the social media platform was acquired by Elon Musk in 2022.“We also know that historically social media algorithms are tweaked in order to further that content, because they know that it promotes engagement, and engagement over the long term is their business model,” he said.Last year, an analysis by The Washington Post found that Elon Musk’s Twitter was amplifying hate speech in its “For You” timeline, an unintended side effect of an algorithm that is supposed to show users more of what they want.X, formerly Twitter, says in its user guidelines that hateful conduct, including attacking people on the basis of race, ethnicity or religious affiliation, is forbidden. A Washington Post request for comment, sent to X’s main media email account, was met with an automated response: “Busy now, please check back later.”Sunder Katwala, director of the British Futures think tank, said the Southport case demonstrates not only the influence of far-right extremists on social media, but the threat posed by anti-Muslim prejudice in Britain.By attempting to link Muslim people to specific crimes, far-right groups are hoping to appeal to a broader segment of the population that continues to entertain anti-Muslim stereotypes, Katwala said.Sunrise in Southport.

Bricks, bottles, fireworks sit alongside bits of a burnt out police vehicle - metal melted in the heat. @GMB pic.twitter.com/AD0wZS2zImBritain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, a former top prosecutor, said those who rioted in Southport on Tuesday night will “feel the full force of the law.”“It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives,” Alex Goss, assistant chief constable of the Merseyside Police, said in a statement Tuesday. “Our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavor to prevent disorder.”According to the Liverpool Echo news website, Jenni Stancombe, the mother of one of the slain girls, wrote on social media, “This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.”On Wednesday morning, locals with brooms where clearing the streets where the riot took place."
WaPo_77,Let tomatoes be both fruit and vegetable in this juicy peach salad,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/31/tomato-peach-salad/,2024-07-31 22:00:02.864917,,"This summer-fruit-filled salad featuring tomatoes leans into its double life as both a fruit and a vegetable.Botanically, tomato is a fruit, as it grows from a flower and contains seeds. But from a culinary point of view, its nutrient profile and how it is commonly eaten, tomato presents as a vegetable, and was declared as such by the U.S. Supreme Court in its unanimous ruling in 1893.Legal arguments aside, I say, why box it in? Let it be both! This salad is a prime example of the possibilities that emerge from letting a tomato express its sweet and savory sides.Get the recipe: Tomato and Peach SaladIn this recipe, fresh grape or cherry tomatoes (it’s no coincidence the varieties are named after fruits) are tossed with ripe peaches and blueberries. This extraordinary combination showcases the juicy fruitiness these ingredients have in common.But being ambidextrous, the tomatoes here also act as a bridge to the savory side, inviting bites of red onion and a vinaigrette to the party. The light sweetness of the white balsamic vinegar (or a touch of honey) in the dressing helps reinforce that sweet-savory harmony, as does a sprinkling of floral basil leaves.The resulting fruit salad is meant to be part of the main course, ideally alongside barbeque-sauce-slathered proteins, echoing those sweet-savory flavors while offering cooling, fresh contrast.It’s a spectacular summer side that shows what can happen when we move away from pigeonholing foods, and let them bring their full, unique spectrum of flavor to the table.Get the recipe: Tomato and Peach Salad"

Is real emo the music of D.C.’s emotional hardcore bands or the late-’90s screamo scene? Is it from the Midwest or Long Island? Is it still emo if an internet rapper or a teen pop star makes it?Increasingly, emo has come to mean the poppy punk or punky pop of the sound’s imperial period, when bands like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance took over Hot Topic during the last days of “Total Request Live.” Or at least, that’s what emo means when it’s being sold to aging millennials who have the disposable cash and nostalgic cravings to attend emo-themed destination festivals, DJ nights, cover acts, full-band karaoke experiences and even orchestra collaborations.But as all “elder emos” know, mics are for singing, not swinging, and the bands that hit emo’s greatest heights — along with the wave that inevitably followed — are still paid to spill their guts and make crowds panic when they sing.For more than 20 years, the Warped Tour was a rite of summer that allowed teens of a certain stripe to see all their favorite bands in one go. The festival ended its run as a touring concern in 2018, but the baton was quickly picked up by the Sad Summer Festival, now in its fifth year. This year’s headliners — Mayday Parade, the Maine and the Wonder Years — also played the inaugural edition, proving that the window for what constitutes nostalgia continues to shrink. (Aug. 9 at 2 p.m. at Merriweather Post Pavilion. merriweathermusic.com. $73.)True to its full moniker, AFI has kept a fire inside burning for decades by constantly feeding it new fuel. The East Bay band started out as a hardcore outfit before prioritizing horror instead of humor and embracing the macabre edge of punk. Throughout, vocalist Davey Havok has turned sorrow and suffering into still-resonant rallying cries like “Through our bleeding, we are one.” (Aug. 15 at 6:30 p.m. at Merriweather Post Pavilion. merriweathermusic.com. $46-$281.)New Found Glory epitomized millennial pop-punk by writing impossibly catchy tunes fueled by Jordan Pundik’s nasal lyrics about teenage vulnerability and relationships that are always at their breaking point. Even before they grew up, they seemed to know these youthful concerns were fleeting (“All Downhill From Here,” “Nothing Gold Can Stay”). On this tour, the Florida four-piece will celebrate the 20th anniversary of “Catalyst” by playing the album in full.

New Found Glory provided a name (borrowed from a lyric in “Head On Collision”) and a template for All Time Low, a band founded when its members were still high-schoolers in Towson, Md. Subsequent years have seen All Time Low buff its sharp edges into radio-friendly pop-rock, but the band’s best-known song, “Dear Maria, Count Me In,” has remained part of the emo-punk canon: It even soundtracked a TikTok trend in which emo fans attested, “Mom, it was never a phase — it’s a lifestyle.” (Aug. 22 at 6:30 p.m. at the Atlantis, theatlantis.com, sold out; Aug. 23 at 7 p.m. at 9:30 Club, 930.com, sold out; Aug. 24 at 7 p.m. at Merriweather Post Pavilion, merriweathermusic.com, $57.)While countless emo songs could be described as “gaslight anthems,” the Gaslight Anthem isn’t emo, instead drawing from straight-ahead rock, punk and, notably, Bruce Springsteen, whom the band enlisted in 2023 for a collaboration on its first album after a long hiatus. To scratch that emo itch, catch the openers: California punks Joyce Manor deliver full-throated, full-hearted songs like “Constant Headache,” while Baltimore trio Pinkshift are reclaiming ragged pop-punk from a long lineage of sad White boys.

WaPo_79,Beresovsky’s Deli serves a killer pastrami sandwich. Stick with that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/beresovsky-deli-dc-review/,2024-07-31 23:30:02.833539,,"When Jason Berry was an 18-year-old in Los Angeles, his first restaurant job was at a Jewish deli called Jerry’s. The graveyard shift was the only one he could get.“I met all the lunatics on weekends who were going out for corned beef sandwiches at 2 a.m.,” he said.Berry would go on to work for many more restaurants, but in a very different capacity: As the co-owner of Knead Hospitality and Design, his portfolio encompasses 11 concepts in the region, including Succotash and Mi Vida. The newest of those offerings is Beresovsky’s Deli, a narrow Navy Yard counter across from the ballpark, with a name that pays tribute to one particular Jewish immigrant named Sam Beresovsky, born in the part of the former Russian empire that is now Ukraine. In 1929, when he arrived in the United States, Beresovsky’s name was shortened: He became Sam Berry, Jason Berry’s great-grandfather.Berry knows that deli food is nostalgic, personal and, at times, controversial.“We’ll get people that come in and go, ‘Oh, my God, this is the best pastrami I’ve ever had.’ And then you might have somebody that comes in that says, ‘You call this pastrami?’ You know, and it’s the same pastrami,” he says. “There’s an enormous passion to this kind of food.”Two meals from Beresovsky’s corroborate that anecdote. Some of its offerings — the pillowy matzoh balls with a dilly, robust soup broth and, yes, the housemade pastrami — are top-notch. The knishes (one potato, the other potato and pastrami) and the presence of Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray soda on the menu are a mark of deli authenticity.But a few of Beresovsky’s offerings are lackluster or afflicted by errors. Bites of a Reuben were interrupted by a glob of fatty gristle; the au jus in the Papa Eddie, a French dip with otherwise good brisket, was unbearably salty. Despite an on-menu boast about their New York City provenance, a bagel bore the soft and spongy texture that grocery store bagels often have (a representative for the restaurant says they are from Just Bagels, a wholesaler in the Bronx).The latkes at Beresovsky’s Deli brought to mind a classic borscht belt joke, retold by Woody Allen’s character in “Annie Hall”: Two women are at a Catskills resort, kvetching about the food. And, as one of them notes, “such small portions!” The latkes are potato-chip crispy, thin and — well, small. Perhaps they’re just how the deli your bubbe took you to as a child prepares them, and that makes them great, to echo Berry’s previous anecdote. Or maybe you’re like me, and you’re left wanting them a little thicker, a little potato-ier and a little bigger, too.Keep it simple with a Herbert’s Fave — a classic pastrami and coleslaw — and the egg cream, a must. Beresovsky’s is one of the few places in the area to get the old-timey deli classic: a fizzy, creamy chocolate soda that doesn’t contain egg (according to lore, it’s an Anglicization of the Yiddish “echt keen,” or “pure sweetness”). It uses Fox’s U-Bet chocolate syrup, an ingredient that has been associated with the drink since the early 1900s.“That’s the only syrup for an egg cream, in our opinion,” says Berry, and he’s right.The deli is in a sliver of a spot adjacent to Gatsby, Knead’s Roaring Twenties-themed American restaurant, and the two places share a kitchen and a chef, Treeven Dove. There’s overlap between the two menus to minimize waste — you’ll find the deviled eggs and matzoh ball soup (a dollar cheaper at Beresovsky’s) on both — and pastrami scraps go into Gatsby’s Reuben egg roll.The petite space — bright and modern, outfitted in black and white with pops of sunflower yellow — lends itself more to takeout, or a picnic in nearby Yards Park. But for those who want to nosh before a baseball game, there are a few counter seats by the windows and a small patio. Self-ordering kiosks streamline operations, but there’s still a personal touch: On one visit, a sweet cashier gave a free black and white cookie to a cranky toddler to make the short wait go more quickly.Downtown D.C.’s deli fortunes have risen and fallen over the years. Wagshal’s in Northwest and Parkway in Silver Spring are still going strong, and Buffalo and Bergen and Call Your Mother have expanded to other neighborhoods. Berry hopes Beresovsky’s will leave its mark on D.C., he says: “Deli culture is something that the city needs more of.”1201 Half St. SE. 202-817-3133.Hours: 11 a.m.-8 p.m. daily.Nearest Metro: Navy Yard.Prices: $6.50 to $17 for all items on the menu."
WaPo_80,Antarctic temperatures soar 50 degrees above norm in long-lasting heat wave,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/31/antarctica-heat-wave-warming-climate/,2024-07-31 23:25:02.833539,,"Ground temperatures in East Antarctica have soared more than 50 degrees (28 Celsius) above normal in the second major heat wave to afflict the region in the past two years. This historic warm spell could persist for another 10 days, and is an ominous example of the major temperature spikes this polar climate could experience more frequently in a warming world.“This heat wave is a near-record (or record) event for the region of Antarctica it’s having the biggest impact on,” Edward Blanchard, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, said in an email. “The heat wave’s large footprint is also remarkable,” as it covers a large section of East Antarctica, which makes up most of the continent.The heat wave comes in the middle of the Antarctic winter, so temperatures are still hovering around minus-4 degrees (minus-20 Celsius). Still, the Antarctic temperature anomaly is the largest on the globe, according to weather models.Temperatures are expected to remain up to 36 to 50 degrees (20 to 30 Celsius) above average in parts of East Antarctica for the next 10 days. They have been substantially above average for most of July, but not as high as they are now. Last week, they climbed to 20 degrees (12 Celsius) above average.The South Pole station will clinch its warmest July since 2002, about 11 degrees (6.3 Celsius) above average, according to Antarctic temperature analyst Stefano Di Battista. From July 20 to 30, the average temperature at the station was minus-54 degrees (minus-47.6 Celsius) which is a typical temperature for the end of February — the end of summer in Antarctica. Vostok, at the center of the eastern ice sheet, will see its warmest July since 2009 at around 12 degrees (6.5 Celsius) above average.“The heat wave on the Antarctic Plateau is extraordinary more for its duration than for its intensity, although some values are notable,” Di Battista said in an email.While large parts of the continent have been exceptionally warm, a cold snap in the north brought extreme cold earlier in July. On the 17th, weather stations at Dome Fuji plummeted to minus-115.8 degrees (minus-82.1 Celsius), its second-coldest July temperature on record.Winter temperatures in Antarctica substantially fluctuate because of the lack of sunlight, but this heat wave is a much larger deviation from the norm than usual. It’s too early to determine all of its causes, but scientists say it may be at least partially linked to processes occurring 20 miles (30 kilometers) above the surface in the stratosphere.The stratosphere contains a strong band of cold air and low pressure spinning around each pole, known as the polar vortex. The vortex is typically strong and stable during winter in the southern hemisphere, said Amy Butler, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But this year, she said, it’s been jostled by atmospheric waves, weakening the vortex and causing high-altitude temperatures to soar; this is known as a sudden stratospheric warming event.“The main reason it is notable is because it is usually a relatively quiet time of year for the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex,” Butler said. This event has lead to some record temperatures high in the stratosphere.Data shows that the sudden stratospheric warming event is also affecting the lower atmosphere where weather occurs. The warming has weakened the belt of westerly winds around Antarctica, commonly referred to as the jet stream. This has allowed frigid air normally confined near the South Pole to veer north toward New Zealand, southern Africa and southern South America, like a refrigerator door left ajar. As the deep chill has escaped East Antarctica, temperatures have dramatically risen there in response.Atmospheric pressures over East Antarctica are also surging to “absolutely bonkers” levels, tweeted Ben Noll, a meteorologist based in New Zealand. “The weather in the Southern Hemisphere is a little wild at the moment!” he wrote.Several other factors may be helping to intensify the heat wave. Antarctic sea ice cover is the second-lowest on record for this time of year — just barely above the record-breaking levels in 2023. Sea ice helps keep the polar regions cool by reflecting sunlight back to space. It also helps keep the air cool by acting as a barrier between the colder air and warm waters below, which have been exceptionally warm this year.“It is likely that having less sea ice and a warmer Southern Ocean around the Antarctic continent ‘loads the dice’ for warmer winter weather over Antarctica,” Blanchard said. “From this perspective, it might be a bit ‘less surprising’ to see large heat waves in Antarctica this year compared to a ‘normal’ year with average sea ice conditions.”Scientists say it’s also hard to ignore that the entire world has seen record warmth since last July, consistently exceeding an average of 1.5 Celsius of warming above the preindustrial era. As the globe warms, however, the poles are warming at an even faster rate. Recent ice core data and modeling show Antarctica is warming up twice as fast as the global average.“With global temperatures increasing, that raises the potential 'baseline’ for the average temperatures,” said David Mikolajczyk, a research meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a result, “strong warming events such as this one can occur more frequently and have a bigger impact.”The largest heat wave in Antarctica — and anywhere in the world — occurred in March 2022, when the eastern coast of Antarctica spiked at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) above normal. Scientists on-site wore shorts and removed their shirts, while the area experienced intense melting.“These heat wave events are, unfortunately, getting less and less surprising to me [in the] last years, when several of these events have occurred,” said Sergi Gonzàlez Herrero, an atmospheric scientist at WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research.Jason Samenow contributed to this report."

WaPo_82,Trump continues Black voter push but faces new challenge with Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-black-voters-nabj-harris/,2024-07-31 23:18:02.833539,,"CHICAGO — Former president Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Vice President Harris of once hiding Black heritage she has routinely highlighted in her career, escalating his attacks on her racial identity in a combative interview with Black reporters.Trump drew audible gasps and disbelieving laughter over the roughly 35-minute sit-down session as he berated a Black reporter who pressed him about past offensive comments, falsely claimed that undocumented immigrants were “taking” attendees’ votes, and suggested Harris “was Indian all the way” before “all of a sudden she made a turn” and “became a Black person.”By the end of the day, Trump had renewed his broadsides, with a social media post that suggested Harris, who is Black and Indian American, had rejected her Black identity because she once described herself as Indian while discussing Indian food.The remarkable scene at a convention of Black journalists in Chicago underscored how Trump’s own comments, often riddled with false and sensational claims, have hampered his campaign’s hopes to peel away Black voters who have traditionally backed Democrats. The former president has spoken for years with inflammatory and sometimes racist remarks about Black Americans that have drawn widespread condemnations. On Wednesday, he quickly grew defensive when asked to address them, calling the questions “rude” and “nasty.”Asked if it was acceptable for some of his supporters to derisively call Harris a “DEI hire,” Trump pressed moderators to define the term and then veered into an attack about the vice president’s race. He claimed Harris used to only promote her Indian heritage — even though, as a moderator pointed out, she was part of a historically Black sorority and embraced her Black identity in many ways.“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”Later, Trump pressed the issue again. At his rally in Harrisburg, Pa., a big screen displayed the headline of an old article calling Harris the first Indian American U.S. senator.At the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, Rachel Scott of ABC News began the Q&A session by noting — among other comments — Trump’s insults toward Black prosecutors, his repeated false claims that America’s first Black president was born in Africa and his comments that four congresswomen who are racial minorities should “go back” to the places they came from.“Why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?” Scott said.“Well first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said, calling the interview “disgraceful” and criticizing a “rude introduction.” He alleged he was invited under a “false pretense” because he had expected his opponent to be there as well and criticized the organizers for starting late.“I love the Black population of this country; I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country,” he said.Later, Trump said Harris “was Indian all the way” but then “became a Black person.”“I think somebody should look into that, too,” he said, speaking over his questioner. He continued his frequent mispronunciations of Harris’s first name, which many have called disrespectful and see as an attempt to other-ize her.Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, said at a Wednesday evening fundraiser in Maine that Trump had revealed himself as “a worse version of an already horrible person” with his remarks. “He should never be near the White House again,” Emhoff said, adding, “The insults, the BS — it’s horrible, it’s terrible, it shows a lack of character.”At a White House press briefing — which unfolded at the same time as Trump’s interview — there were gasps in the room when a reporter read Trump’s comments on Harris aloud to press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is the first Black person to hold the position.“Wow,” Jean-Pierre said. She called Trump’s words “repulsive” and said, “No one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify.”In a statement, Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler focused on Trump’s barbs toward Scott and said they reflected Trump’s personal attacks on other Black journalists during his presidency. “Today’s tirade is simply a taste of the chaos and division that has been a hallmark of Trump’s MAGA rallies this entire campaign,” Tyler said.Trump and Harris were both set to court Black voters on Wednesday, as Democrats hope their new candidate can re-energize their most reliable constituency and prevent the GOP from making gains.Republicans have been keen to improve their performance among Black voters and especially Black men, encouraged by polls that showed softening support for President Biden. Trump’s itinerary on Wednesday reflected his continued hopes of chipping away at Democrats’ traditional dominance among Black Americans.But Trump could face a stiffer challenge now that Biden has bowed out of the 2024 race, paving the way for Harris to lead the Democratic ticket. And Chicago showcased Trump’s penchant for veering into personal insults rather than laying out the policy-based case Republicans want to highlight.Some of Trump’s Black Republican allies in Congress, such as Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), came to his defense. P Rae Easley, 36, a Trump supporter and local conservative radio host who attended the Chicago event as a guest of the Trump campaign, argued “he did a really good job coming into an adversarial situation.”But others in the GOP responded to questions about Trump’s remarks with broad suggestions that he should focus elsewhere.“The campaign is, needs to be, mostly about the issues,” said Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, who is running to lead his caucus.Trump’s tone in Chicago brought renewed attention to past remarks that have alienated many Black voters and angered other Americans. Trump raised his political profile falsely claiming Barack Obama was born in Africa; lamented immigration from “shithole counties”; and in 2019 told four congresswomen who are racial minorities to “go back” to the places they came from, even though three of the lawmakers were born in the United States.Trump has also promoted a false conspiracy theory questioning Harris’s citizenship and this week said the vice president would be “like a play toy” for other world leaders.“They look at her and they say, ‘We can’t believe we got so lucky.’ They’re going to walk all over her,” he said in a Fox News interview, adding, “I don’t want to say as to why. But a lot of people understand it.”And he has often portrayed Black communities as riddled with crime and poverty. “What the hell do you have to lose?” Trump said when he ran in 2016.Harris was also invited to speak in Chicago but could not fit it into her schedule, NABJ President Ken Lemon said in a statement. NABJ officials said the organization is talking with Harris about a virtual or in-person Q&A in September. Trump repeatedly taunted Harris on social media for not attending the convention this week, suggesting it was disrespectful.On Wednesday, Trump kept returning to his pique at Scott, the ABC moderator. At one point, he diverted from a question about his age to reiterate that “she was very rude.”“That was a nasty — that wasn't a question — she didn’t ask me a question, she gave a statement,” Trump said.“I repeated your statements, sir, actually,” Scott replied.A little over half an hour into the conversation, Scott abruptly cut it short, saying, “I think we have to leave it there, by the Trump team.” The event had started more than an hour late.Throughout, the crowd had gasped repeatedly at Trump’s answers and sometimes made sounds of protest.“False! False! False!” one attendee yelled out, as Trump falsely asserted that undocumented immigrants arriving in the United States are “taking votes away from all of the people in this room.”“You just lie!” one audience member said.1/5Harris, meanwhile, was expected to speak in Houston on Wednesday evening to a gathering of the sorority Sigma Gamma Rho — the latest in her extensive outreach to members of historically Black sororities and fraternities that make up the “Divine Nine.”Angel Crawford, 55, and Monique Johnson, 43, who were both attending the sorority event, said they were angered by Trump’s comments in Chicago but not surprised.“It’s just wrong. He acts like an infant just to get attention,” Crawford said.Johnson said his comments would only make women, particularly Black women, less likely to support him. “It’s very disrespectful. He’s so sexist, and it’s unacceptable,” she said.Democratic operatives say Harris’s candidacy already shows signs of motivating Black voters — whose flagging enthusiasm for Biden had left a hole in the Democratic base. One CNN survey found that Black voters, who previously split 70 percent for Biden and 23 percent for Trump, backed Harris by a wider margin of 78 percent to Trump’s 15 percent. Other polling shows less of a shift.Republicans are betting that a so-called “Harris honeymoon” will fade and are pumping tens of millions into ads attacking Harris.Trump’s campaign had said that in Chicago he would discuss “the most pressing issues facing the Black community.” The moderators included Scott as well as Harris Faulkner of Fox News and Kadia Goba of Semafor.Trump’s plans for a Q&A at the NABJ convention drew backlash from some members before he took the stage. One former White House correspondent called it a “slap in the face” to Black women journalists Trump had previously insulted.Lemon defended the group’s decision to invite Trump as standard. The organization asks major-party presidential candidates to speak each election year.“While we acknowledge the concerns expressed by our members, we believe it is important for us to provide our members with the opportunity to hear directly from candidates and hold them accountable,” Lemon said in a statement.Trump’s team has made a point to hold Black outreach events, even as his rally crowds skew heavily White. In recent months, Trump has campaigned at a Black church in Detroit and rallied in the South Bronx, where he touted his economic record and said his policies would protect voters of color from crime. A pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., has run some ads targeted to Black voters that hit the Biden administration on high inflation, undocumented immigration and transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports.Trump has also suggested that Black voters like him more because of his criminal cases. “I’m being indicted for you, the Black population,” Trump said this February at a gala for the Black Conservative Federation.Democrats, meanwhile, have promoted record-low Black unemployment during the Biden administration — and tried to communicate how their policies are helping Black voters who have often expressed cynicism about both parties. They have also accused Republicans of broadly trying to take the country backward.“Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights,” Harris told members of Zeta Phi Beta last week. She listed — among other concerns — “the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate” and “the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history.”Trump’s event at NABJ came as his vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, faces harsh scrutiny. In Chicago, Trump defended Vance but also said there is evidence that running mates have little impact on elections.“You’re voting for me,” Trump said. “If you like me, I’m gonna win. If you don’t like me, I’m not gonna win.”Knowles reported from Washington.

Biles didn’t tag her former teammate, but the caption sure seemed to be a reference to Skinner’s comments after this year’s U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials.A post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles)“Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t what it used to be,” Skinner, who won the silver medal on vault at the 2020 Tokyo Games, said in a since-deleted YouTube video. “I mean, obviously, a lot of girls just don’t work as hard. The girls just don’t have the work ethic, and it’s hard too because of SafeSport. Coaches can’t get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say, which in some ways is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics, you do have to be a little aggressive, a little intense.”(The U.S. Center for SafeSport was an independent body set up by Congress in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal to investigate misconduct across Olympic sports.)Skinner apologized in a statement a few days later and claimed that her comments had been misinterpreted, but Biles had the last word after her eighth Olympic medal made her the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history.“F AROUND AND FIND OUT,” Biles’s husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, commented on the Instagram post, a reference to the name Biles and her teammates revealed they had given themselves during a news conference after they won gold.The befitting name is spicier than some of the monikers the U.S. women’s gymnastics team has gone by at previous Olympics, including the “Magnificent Seven” (1996), “Fierce Five” (2012), “Final Five” (2016) and “Fighting Four” (2021).Aly Raisman asks Simone Biles and the team what their nickname is.""F.A.A.F.O.""F**k around and find out pic.twitter.com/RJjZ5OWcQgMcKayla Maroney, who won gold with the Americans at the 2012 Games, chimed in with a comment on Biles’s Instagram post, too, hoping to clear up any confusion about the similar name she shares with Skinner.“It doesn’t get more iconic than this,” Maroney wrote. “She f’d around n found out [for real]. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.”“put a finger down if simone biles just ended you,” Biles’s teammate Sunisa Lee, the reigning all-around champion, added.Biles offered an alternative, G-rated name for the squad on X.“okay on the real though, the official team name is golden girls (because oldest olympic team),” she wrote.To Skinner, this year’s squad might always be Team F.A.A.F.O.okay on the real though, the official team name is ✨golden girls✨ (because oldest olympic team) s/o to cecile🥹🤍"
WaPo_84,Musicians Dis Fig and the Body connected by the ‘same kind of heaviness’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/dis-fig-body-concert-dc/,2024-07-31 23:00:02.833539,,"Growing up in New Jersey, Felicia Chen took piano lessons and sang with the choir at a high school with an acclaimed music program. Two decades later, that conventional musical background has been supplanted by eclecticism and experimentation. Chen is known as Dis Fig, a Berlin-based DJ and musician. She’s now touring with the Body, a Rhode Island duo, to promote the threesome’s grimly beautiful collaborative album, “Orchards of a Futile Heaven.”Chen, who adopted the tag Dis Fig about 12 years ago when she began DJing in New York City, makes music mostly with her voice and a computer, although she does play such acoustic instruments as the accordion. “It’s an amazing instrument,” she says. “It’s like a piano that breathes.”The Body is guitarist-vocalist Chip King and drummer-programmer Lee Buford, whose style has been described as experimental metal. The band has been recording for 20 years but has made more than twice as many collaborative albums as ones featuring just King and Buford.“I feel like we’re both searching for this same kind of heaviness, which doesn’t have to do just with loudness or harshness,” Dis Fig says of her current musical partners. “When people think of heavy music, they think of anger, or darkness. But it’s also hope and fear and vulnerability: the full range of human emotions.”“Orchards of a Futile Heaven” is something that “blossomed from the internet,” Dis Fig recalls. “We had been fans of each other from afar. Eventually, they reached out and said that we should work on something together.”The album, which layers vocals that sometimes recall Bjork atop caustic soundscapes, took three years to make. The musicians constructed the seven brooding songs by trading digital recordings of individual musical parts, known as “stems,” via email.“We didn’t meet each other face to face until the album was almost finished,” Dis Fig says. “I was on tour by myself, and we ended up doing a show together. But we had already almost finished the whole record.”The singer takes responsibility for the lengthiness of the recording process. “I’m pretty perfectionist and pretty detailed. So I feel like maybe the reason it took so long was because I was extending the time frame and feeling it wasn’t fully finished enough.”Now she’s enjoying collaborating in real time in front of an audience. “This is my first time touring with a band. So it’s all new to me. And it’s exciting.”Dis Fig moved to Berlin about a decade ago, she explains, because “I was trying to learn how to make music, and New York didn’t give me the time or the space to do that. Working three jobs, seven days a week.”“I was thinking about moving to London, Berlin or Tokyo, and I decided on Berlin because it was cheap and I had been there and I felt a sense of freedom when I was there.”She released her debut solo album, “Purge,” in 2019. “After high school, I had quit singing for 10 years before I came back around to it. It was actually a blessing that it took me so long, because those 10 years allowed me to unlearn,” she says, the choral technique of “trying to blend your voice into everyone else’s voice.”Starting over, Dis Fig says, “allowed me to sit down and figure out my own voice. I’m still trying to explore where I can take it.”Aug. 2 at 8 p.m. at Songbyrd Music House, 540 Penn St. NE. songbyrddc.com. $20-$25."

WaPo_86,7 cooler vacation destinations in Europe,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/europe-travel-italy-england-germany-vienna/,2024-08-01 01:48:02.623376,,"If you’re used to seeing vacation photos of Greek beaches, Roman ruins and Spanish cities dominate your social media feeds, you’re not alone. These European classics have long filled the bucket lists of most travelers.But rising temperatures and soaring prices at the continent’s most popular spots have the savviest of us seeking out alternatives that can offer not just respite from the heat and crowds but also better value.Some of the following destinations previously were more popular during other seasons, while others were off most travelers’ lists entirely. Now, new attractions, easier flight connections, growing culinary scenes and hotel openings are changing their appeal.They may not be as known for their summertime exploits as St. Tropez and Barcelona, but they are proving to be just as captivating.Wellness trends in recent years have boosted interest in mountain destinations, said Henley Vazquez, founder of the travel agency Fora Travel. “Many travelers are looking to accomplish something on their trips rather than the traditional fly-and-flop beach stays,” she said. They “want to wake up, climb a mountain, personally challenge themselves, then balance with relaxation.”
For European travel, that means more people are looking to the Dolomites for their next holiday. Alberto Schiavon, a former Olympic snowboarder who now manages his family’s Hotel Chalet del Sogno, in the ski town of Madonna di Campiglio, said the Dolomites’ mild summer temperatures enable more active vacationers to go on excursions all day long. Schiavon leads biking tours as well as hiking and climbing adventures in the Dolomites, which he describes as limestone skyscrapers that shoot out of lush green forests.
As a relaxing counterweight, most of the area hotels feature decadent spas. And, because you’re in Italy, great meals are never too far away.
“Find yourself in a picnic in the middle of the Dolomite towers or enjoying a gourmet lunch in a mountain hut at the base,” Schiavon said. “The quality is always going to be high.”Wellness trends in recent years have boosted interest in mountain destinations, said Henley Vazquez, founder of the travel agency Fora Travel. “Many travelers are looking to accomplish something on their trips rather than the traditional fly-and-flop beach stays,” she said.

But if you’ve been there and done that, consider the wild landscapes of the Azores, Portugal’s nine-island archipelago in the middle of the Atlantic.
“The diverse geography of the islands always offers cooler and fresher areas to explore, such as natural parks filled with shade and a refreshing atmosphere, or coastal areas where it is pleasant to swim and enjoy our Atlantic waters,” said Filipe Lucas Frazão, founder of the travel company Atlantic Brine.
With an average daytime temperature of around 75 degrees, the nine islands allow for a wide range of outdoor summertime experiences. Atlantic Brine leads tours around Pico, which has wineries on volcanic soil and is great for trekkers and wine lovers. São Miguel, the largest isle, is home to the twin lakes of Sete Cidades and the steamy hot springs of Furnas. And on São Jorge you can find fantastic cheese, coffee plantations (a rarity in Europe) and remote surf breaks.Portugal’s tourism cachet shot up several years ago, drawing increasing international visitors to Lisbon, Porto and beach destinations like Comporta and Algarve.

Days there often start in a historic cafe sipping a mélange (a local take on the cappuccino) and snacking on Viennese pastries, before a stretch of museum-hopping to see the best of architect Otto Wagner and painters Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt. Then, you can pick between a Michelin-starred dinner or maybe a more casual meal at a schnitzel house.
Vienna has started to make a play for more tourism, with an influx of big-name hotels at lower price points than in Paris or Rome. New direct flights from the United States — Austrian Airlines started flying from Boston in July — also mean that getting to Vienna has never been easier.
A city like Vienna is “heavy on history and culture where you can also go deep on dining and stay in gorgeous hotels, all at a more budget-friendly level,” Vazquez said. She also credits Vienna’s rising popularity to connectivity: From there, it’s easy to reach more of Austria’s beautiful and historic cities, like Salzburg, or the cool embrace of the Austrian Alps.This former imperial capital in the center of Europe offers a lot of what you would want from Europe’s historic major cities: world-class art, award-winning restaurants, user-friendly public transportation and lovely shopping.

Ten of its restaurants hold Michelin stars.
The Julian Alps, which run across the country’s north and border both Italy and Austria, boast stunning bucolic landscapes: the jagged peaks, the fairy-tale vibe of Lake Bled and the emerald waters of the Virje waterfall. But when it comes to food, the area offers a unique kaleidoscope of regional influences.
“This part of Slovenia is a cooler and more relaxing area that’s influenced by Austria and the Balkans, and that can be found in its cuisine as well,” said Ivana Tomic, founder of tour operator Journey 2 Slovenia. Like in many mountain regions, meals here often revolve around heartier fare such as nourishing stews, juicy sausages, dishes that feature wild game and mushrooms, and lots of local cheese varieties. When temperatures drop, try jota, a soup with sauerkraut and beans.
While the culinary traditions here might sound more modest and comforting, the Slovenian Alps are also home to two of the country’s most sought-after dining reservations: the three-starred Hiša Franko, by chef Ana Roš, in the picturesque ​​Soča Valley, and the two-star, lakeside Milka.Slovenia, which is roughly the size of New Jersey, has gained renown for its booming food scene.

Norway’s second city offers a stirring mix of small-town charm, dramatic natural surroundings and compelling history. The 2022 launch of a United Airlines flight between Newark and otherwise far-flung Bergen makes reaching it much easier.
Yngve Hansen, a hotel general manager who was raised in Bergen, said that what makes it sing in the summer is its medley of culture and nature. You can see Edvard Munch masterpieces from the Kode art collection, attend electronic music parties, and check out jazz and film festivals.
“Combine these experiences with a hike in the mountains or paddle in the nearby archipelago — that is a perfect day in Bergen,” Hansen said. Even in summer, he said, you can ski a glacier at Folgefonna, then taste local cider from apple farms in the fjord.Scandinavia has experienced a surge of summer tourism this year, but if you want to avoid the crowds that descend on Stockholm, Copenhagen and Reykjavik, Iceland, consider the gateway to the fjords: Bergen.

“We’re seeing the most in-the-know types pairing London with boutique bolt-holes in the rolling hills outside of the city,” Vazquez said. “This summer alone, we’ve seen a tenfold increase in bookings here.” Most will focus on the southeast, where you’ll find the heaviest concentration of England’s vineyards.
The wine country there, which orbits Kent and Sussex, typically features chalky soil and mild, sunny weather that’s drawing new wine labels nearly every year. Michelin Green Star winner Leonardslee Lakes & Gardens just launched its own bottling of sparkling vino to go with its farm-fresh cuisine. The folks from Taittinger, the famed French producers of champagne, are expected to unveil the first vintage from their Chilham vineyard, Domaine Evremond, this year.

The folks from Taittinger, the famed French producers of champagne, are expected to unveil the first vintage from their Chilham vineyard, Domaine Evremond, this year.A host of festivals and wine trails have also been popping up in the region as its success picks up.

The Brothers Grimm fairy tales are another well-known local export, and many of them are set in the region.
Through September, the region is hosting Ornamenta, a large contemporary art and design exhibition with events all over the Black Forest, from publicly installed sundials to tasting events reinventing the Black Forest cake.
“The region is a well-kept secret,” said Katharina Wahl, one of the curators of Ornamenta and a native of one of the Black Forest’s larger cities: Karlsruhe. “Because of its size and a lack of a central town or city, it has stayed out of the focus of international travelers.”
Its size also means there’s so much you can do in the Black Forest. You can tour the hilltop Gothic revival Hohenzollern Castle from the 19th century; explore Schiltach, a half-timbered medieval village; get to know Freiburg, one of the region’s biggest cities, and its massive, Middle Ages-era cathedral; or, for a bit of glamour, check out Baden-Baden, the elegant spa town whose waters have been luring pilgrims (including, in recent years, Hollywood celebrities) since Roman times.To combine high-quality art and design with gorgeous natural surroundings, head to the Black Forest, in southwest Germany.

WaPo_87,Where does Hamas go from here?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/hamas-haniyeh-israel-gaza-war/,2024-08-01 01:46:02.623376,,"JERUSALEM — The killing of Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, on Wednesday upends cease-fire talks at a critical moment and, in the longer term, risks empowering more hard-line figures within the movement, according to experts and officials monitoring the group.Haniyeh was Hamas’s diplomat. He led its operations from exile in Qatar. Through 10 months of war, he was the group’s negotiator on the global stage, tasked with brokering a deal acceptable to the group in exchange for pausing fighting and releasing scores of Israeli hostages.“In the short term, it is pretty clear that it will, at best, postpone the cease-fire negotiations indefinitely,” said Erik Skare, a researcher at the University of Oslo and author of a forthcoming book on Palestinian militancy. “Hamas would have little interest negotiating with Israel after the latter assassinated one of its most senior members.”Israel has remained quiet about the assassination but was widely seen to be responsible.Political analysts described Haniyeh’s death in Tehran as a significant blow but cautioned that earlier assassinations of figures with greater political or symbolic influence had not substantially weakened the group. Israel killed a series of Hamas political and military figures in 2003. By the end of the following year, it had assassinated the group’s founder and Haniyeh’s mentor, Ahmed Yassin, and then-leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.“While his death will undoubtedly leave an impact, this wound will soon be healed,” Suheil al-Hindi, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said of Haniyeh’s killing.Haniyeh, who had already survived multiple attempts on his life, is likely to be swiftly replaced, said Azmi Keshawi, Crisis Group’s Gaza researcher. “Hamas is a well-constructed movement. They have lost their biggest leaders before, and a replacement is always ready,” he said.The movement’s leadership structure is horizontal, meaning that other senior figures “have the experience and authority to step in,” said Jeroen Gunning, a professor of Middle Eastern politics and conflict studies at King’s College London and the author of “Hamas in Politics.” “There’s an obsession within Israel with assassinating top Hamas leaders because it’s a symbolic act, but it doesn’t do very much here in terms of the conflict overall, except push back a cease-fire and a two-state solution.”It is unclear how many of Hamas’s leaders on Oct. 7 — the day Hamas militants attacked southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people — remain alive. Yehiya Sinwar, the group’s leader in Gaza, is thought to be running operations from the enclave’s extensive tunnel network. On July 13, an Israeli strike targeted the head of Hamas’s military wing, Mohammed Deif, and it is publicly unknown whether he survived. Scores of Palestinians were killed during that attack.At least 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. More than 100 Israeli hostages have been released from Gaza, but dozens more remain in captivity, with their fates uncertain.The group’s leadership structure is divided between those inside Gaza and those on the outside. Haniyeh stepped down as Hamas’s leader in Gaza in 2017 to assume his latest position. Since then, Sinwar, who is considered more ideologically hard line, has been the driving force behind policy inside Gaza and was among the masterminds of the Oct. 7 assault that caught some Hamas leaders abroad off guard.Traditionally, Hamas has used internal election to select political leaders. “It’s not entirely clear how much of the process they have been famous for is still intact, or whether different wings in different places communicate as fully as they did before. But Hamas has a long history of holding elections in very adverse circumstances, including when they have been in the prisons,” Gunning said.A key question now is which camp his replacement will hail from. Haniyeh “was one of the moderate figures within Hamas, compared to the other, hawkish leaders or personalities,” said Mukhaimer Abu Saada, a political scientist who fled Gaza for Egypt late last year.“The assassination of Haniyeh also matters because it potentially alters the power dynamics within Hamas, and not in favor of those desiring a cease-fire or a two-state solution,” Skare said. “Much depends on who takes Haniyeh’s place in the short, and then long term, after internal elections.”After nine months of war, the Hamas-run government remains a key source of civil authority across the Gaza Strip — a testament to the group’s reach and resiliency, and a reflection of the limits of the military campaign aimed at eradicating it.Israel’s campaign to eliminate the group has been ruinous for Gaza. The enclave’s ability to feed itself has been destroyed, and famine is looming. Every family has seen loved ones killed in the war.On Wednesday, Palestinians in Gaza described mixed feelings at news of Haniyeh’s killing. Some Gazans were angry at senior Hamas leadership for provoking the war and in some cases not sharing the suffering of the people. Some said they felt exhausted and depressed about a conflict that shows no signs of abating.Many Palestinians who voted for Hamas in 2006 — the last legislative elections to be held in Gaza — did so to protest the ruling Fatah party, which was widely viewed as corrupt and incompetent. Haniyeh was the group’s first prime minister.Karima Hassan, 63, said she had voted for Hamas but had been disappointed when its promise of reforms yielded little change. “They just brought us from one war to another,” she said.Some Palestinians fretted that Haniyeh’s death would empower more hard-line figures at the top of the party.“I feel sad because Haniyeh was considered relatively balanced,” said Fadi Ahmed, 41, a father of four. But mostly he was angry at Hamas leadership for provoking the war. His children had all been severely wounded in the war, he said. “The fire in my heart will not cool down except with killing of their leaders outside Gaza, so that they taste the pain of loss that I have been living for seven months,” he said.The assassination, experts said, was unlikely to bring an end to that suffering. “I’m very much sure that cease-fire negotiations will be on hold for some time,” said Abu Saada. “No one will dare from Hamas to speak about a cease-fire with Israel right now, or in the very near future.”Harb reported from London, Balousha from Cairo and Berger from Jerusalem."

The region is entering its fifth heat wave of the year, and it could last at least a week.On Thursday and Friday, temperatures could near the century mark.The heat comes as the District is about to clinch its fourth hottest July on record, which featured four days in the triple digits. Meteorological summer — which began June 1 and ends Aug. 31 — ranks as the second warmest on record to date.The District has already posted 35 days at or above 90 degrees this summer, just five shy of the annual average of 40. Last year there were only 19 as of this date, and 32 for the entire year.Looking ahead, the potential is there to pile up at least seven straight days with highs in the 90s because of a heat dome sprawled over a large part of the nation.It appears the hottest part of this blast will occur Thursday and Friday, when highs rise into the mid- to upper 90s. Heat indexes, which take into account humidity, will make it feel like 100 to 110.Heat advisories may yet be issued as temperatures rise. The Weather Service’s 0-to-4 HeatRisk scale projects much of the region will reach Level 3, with pockets of Level 4 or “extreme” heat possible in the Beltway area.It’s not out of the question that the District hits 100 on Thursday or Friday. It has already reached the triple digits five times this year (four times in July and once in June), tied for the fifth most instances on record. Years with more such days include 1980 (6 instances), 1988 (7), 2012 (8) and 1930 (11).In about 10 days, the weather pattern looks less favorable for sustained heat. While more hot days will be probable after that point, we may well be past the worst.Over the past 13 days, the District has seen a welcome pause in extreme heat, with just five of them reaching 90. Still, the extreme heat between mid-June and mid-July pushed summer temperatures into historic territory.Washington’s average temperature of 81.7 degrees for the summer to date is the second hottest on record, just shy of the top mark of 81.9 degrees in 2010. Baltimore is also having its second-hottest summer. To the west, Dulles International Airport is having its hottest summer.Much of the East Coast, from southern New England to Florida, is experiencing one of its top-five hottest summers on record.The 35 days with highs at or above 90 degrees so far places 2024 in a tie for  10th place for the most on record to date. It’s the most since 2020 when there were 37 such days at the end of July.On average, the District hasn’t posted 35 days at or above 90 until Aug. 23.From August onward, D.C. averages 15 more 90-degree days. If this year’s tally reaches 50 days, it will rank among the top 20. 2010 and 1980 hold the record for the most 90-degree days with 67."
WaPo_90,‘Perris in Paris:’ A U.S. BMX rider makes her name at the Olympics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/perris-benegas-silver-paris-olympics-bmx-park/,2024-08-01 01:22:02.623376,,"PARIS — She knows. She’s heard the comments. Several times, actually. But it seems kind of necessary, so we’ll allow it one last time.So, your name is Perris. The Olympics are in Paris. Was this destined to be?“No, I’ve never heard Perris in Paris,” the BMX freestyle rider Perris Benegas said with an eye roll, a smile, and brand new silver medal. “No, I’m just kidding.”To get our facts straight, Benegas was actually named after the Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, but that doesn’t mean fate didn’t play some role her journey — from disappointment at the Tokyo Olympics, to the operating table, to another operating table and then, on a sweltering afternoon in Paris, to the medals stand.“I’m speechless,” she said. “It hasn’t even set in yet.”Benegas treated the course like her personal playground, even though it’s among the most unique and historic venues at the Paris Games. The BMX park course is in the middle of the Place de la Concorde. It’s a giant public square where heads rolled during the French Revolution, but this summer, bikes flip and skateboards twirl. This is the Olympic home of several youth-oriented urban sports, including breaking, skateboarding, three-on-three basketball and the BMX freestyle competition.The purple and lavender park course is about the size of a hockey rink with ramps, jumps and walls scattered throughout. Riders get 60 seconds to throw the biggest, baddest, boldest tricks possible.At 29, Benegas was the oldest in the field Wednesday. After finishing fourth in the Tokyo Olympics, falling just 0.70 points shy of a medal, she underwent shoulder surgery in 2022. Then last year, she was knocked down again, this time surgery to repair her ACL and meniscus. Needless to say, she was happy just to reach Paris and qualify for these Olympics.“The second I hurt my knee, it was one of the first thoughts that popped in my head,” she said. “Obviously you have highs and lows. The lows were really low.""A native of Reno, Nev., who now lives and trains in Raleigh, N.C., Benegas treated her rehab and recovery like a full-time job, intent on getting back on her bike and then getting her bike back into the air.“There’s nobody more hard-working than Perris,” said Hannah Roberts, her friend and fellow competitor here. “Just watching her mentality going through rehab and going through the gym and getting right back into where we started. That’s super impressive.""After Tuesday’s qualifying, all eyes were on Roberts, the 22-year-old who won silver at the Tokyo Games and seemed like a podium lock. But this sport, like most, offers no guarantees. Tokyo gold medal winner Great Britain’s Charlotte Worthington reminded everyone of that one day earlier, when she missed the finals. Nikita Ducarroz, the bronze winner three years ago, also failed to advance.Riders have to strategize and decide how big they want to go, whether the rewards are worth the risks. Roberts put together a spectacular first run — until the final 10 seconds. She attempted a front flip but couldn’t complete the rotation. She ended up on the ground, her fallen bike beside her.That meant the five-time world champion had no margin for error. Each rider gets two runs in the Olympics. The top score is the one that counts, which meant Roberts had just one shot. As the last rider of the competition, she knew the score to beat — 92.60, posted by China’s Yawen Deng.But this time she took a spill on her very first trick, effectively ending her run and dashing her chances of returning to the podium. She called it an “unfortunate mistake.”“I don’t know how, I don’t know why,” she said, “but I’m human. Today just wasn’t my day.”Meanwhile, Benegas was fourth after her first run with a score of 83.40. She knew that wasn’t going to win any hardware here, but she threw down a stellar second run. She showed plenty of height and mixed in a big 360 and an impressive no-hander. Her score of 90.70 shot her to the second slot on the leader board. She nervously watched as two of the final three riders failed to match her and Deng held strong atop the standings.""I’m just over the moon,” she said."
WaPo_91,Indie musician Mxmtoon’s latest source of inspiration: Her younger self,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/31/mxmtoon-concert-dc/,2024-08-01 01:13:02.623376,,"Mxmtoon did not mean to get famous. In her Southern California childhood home, where she grew up as the daughter of two teachers, internet safety was a priority. There were rules against unsupervised social media use and posting information about herself online.Which worked out — right up until she became a teenager.During high school, the now-24-year-old indie pop musician would wait until everyone in her house was asleep, usually about 10 p.m., then take out her ukulele, log on to her computer, turn up the gain on the microphone that her friends gave her for her 14th birthday, and play as quietly as possible.These ukulele confessional ditties were crafted with a desktop recording app and Mxmtoon’s teenage turmoil.“It felt like I had a space outside of school, or my friends or my family, that was entirely my own and entirely up to me to curate. I don’t know if I felt like I had many places like that when I was a kid, so it felt really important when I found it as a teenager,” Mxmtoon said in a Zoom interview from her Philadelphia hotel room. “I grew too big eventually. You can’t really become a pop star without telling your parents, I guess.”After Mxmtoon revealed in late high school that she had over 10,000 SoundCloud followers and articles were being written about her, the first thing her mom asked was whether the people online knew her last name. They did not, and she still likes to keep her surname under wraps — preferring to go by just Maia.In the years since that admission about her late-night recording sessions, Mxmtoon has released two studio albums (with a third on the way). And on Friday, she’ll perform for an audience in the tens of thousands as she opens for sibling pop trio AJR at Capital One Arena.Her latest single, “I Hate Texas,” came about thanks to “Dune: Part Two.” The self-described cinephile spent the first half of her recent recording session with hyper-pop collaborator Underscores discussing the film and how its tone would change if the score had been that of a Western.That is how Mxmtoon wrote her first country song. In the breakup song bedazzled with country twang and led by her melodic voice, she sings: “I’m turning every corner with exceeded caution/ Hoping, praying, begging that you’re not in Austin/ I hate Texas, but the exits have more room/ To run away from you.”The rest of the album is an ode to the sincerity of her youth. “The whole record itself is vulnerable in a way that I feel like is reminiscent of the earlier Mxmtoon songs,” she says. She’s worked to figure out how to get back in touch with the vulnerability of her 17-year-old self and carry that into this new record.For an artist not originally meant to be online, she has made the internet her playground, with accounts on Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube. Oh, and she has published two graphic novels.For a full-time musician, whose debut studio album peaked at 45 on the U.S. indie albums chart in 2019, that is a mountain of work. But Mxmtoon is a product of the golden age of internet influencers: “I just don’t know how not to,” she explains. “The people that I looked up to and admired when I was on the internet as a young kid were these like multi-hyphenate YouTubers that were doing everything under the sun.”Plus, she adds, “I so much enjoy every side of everything creative that being able to dip my toes into each pond is super fulfilling.”As she enters her mid-20s, Mxmtoon is trying to look back at her younger self with empathy. It’s easy to hear her adolescent songs today and feel a twinge of embarrassment, but those tracks have become motifs in the lives of so many fans that Mxmtoon wanted to reclaim them for her present self.“Maybe I deserve to rewrite what I was doing when I was 17 so that way I can see it in the context of where I am now in my 20s,” she says.Enter: the revised songs — songs for which Mxmtoon has changed the lyrics to better represent her current life. In the new version of her ukulele-led track “1-800-DATEME,” Mxmtoon switched out lyrics that previously only referenced having crushes on men to include crushing on women to represent her bisexuality.“How often do we really get to sit with ourselves at the weirdest, most hormonally emotional moment of our lives and reassess how that makes us feel later on?” she asks. “I think it was really helpful to me to get back in touch with where I was when I was writing songs when I was 17 and reestablish that relationship.”Because no matter where the fame and fans take her, the person she wants to be most loyal to is that ukulele-playing teenager back in California.Aug. 2 at 7 p.m. at Capital One Arena, 601 F St. NW. capitalonearena.com. $89-$130."
WaPo_92,Israel has a long history of assassination operations across borders,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/hamas-leader-assassination-history/,2024-08-01 01:07:02.623376,,"Israel has pursued its enemies from afar for decades, targeting Hamas leaders not only in the Palestinian territories but much farther afield.The killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran early Wednesday likely adds to the list. Hamas has described the death of Haniyeh, the head of its political wing, as an assassination. The group, along with Iran, blamed Israel for the killing and vowed retaliation — raising fears that the Middle East could be plunged into further chaos.The Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli prime minister’s office declined to comment on Haniyeh’s death in Tehran, and Israel has not claimed responsibility.Israel does sometimes confirm its role in targeted killings. The Israeli military said this week that it had killed Fuad Shukr, whom it called Hezbollah’s most “senior military commander,” in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday. Israel’s military said the attack on Shukr was retaliation for a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday.But often the country has refused to confirm its role in targeted killings across borders, preferring a strategic ambiguity that allows a veil of deniability.Here are some of the other significant plots to kill Hamas leaders that have been linked to Israel.Yahya Ayyash, the chief bombmaker for Hamas, was killed by answering a rigged cellular phone in Gaza in 1996. Nicknamed “The Engineer,” Ayyash was likely targeted by Israeli agents, The Washington Post previously reported. Ayyash was believed to be responsible for introducing suicide bombings as a terrorism weapon against Israel, the New York Times reported in 1996, adding that Israel considered him the mastermind behind terrorist attacks since 1992 that had claimed at least 60 lives and wounded hundreds.While nobody claimed responsibility for Ayyash’s killing, Israeli state radio first reported his death, citing “informed Israeli sources.”Ayyash’s killing sparked a string of fatal bus bombings in Israel.Khaled Meshal, a Hamas leader who grew up in the West Bank, survived an Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997.Meshal left the West Bank after the Israeli takeover in 1967, and moved to Kuwait, and then Jordan in 1991, where he was an active member of Hamas. He became the chief of Hamas’s political bureau in 1996, as reported by The Washington Post.One year later, while on a street in Amman, Meshal was injected in the ear with a lethal poison by Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence agency, in an operation approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Meshal survived — Jordan’s King Hussein arrested the agents responsible and threatened to break a newly minted peace accord with Israel if it did not provide the poison’s antidote. The agents were later released in exchange for an apology for the botched assassination and the release of 20 other prisoners.The Hamas leader continued to live in Jordan until 1999, when the group was banned by the King; then he moved to Qatar, then Syria, and back to Qatar. Meshal became the group’s top political leader in 2004 after Israel assassinated Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Hamas’s political leader in Gaza, Abdel Aziz Rantisi.Meshal remains a senior figure in Hamas.Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, was killed in an Israeli helicopter strike in Gaza City in 2004.Yassin, a wheelchair-bound Palestinian cleric, was among those who formed Hamas in 1987.Yassin spent years of his life in an Israeli prison. In 1983 he was arrested by Israeli forces for allegedly forming an underground organization and possessing weapons. He was released two years later as part of a prisoner swap, according to Al Jazeera.In 1989, he was arrested again and sentenced to 40 years in prison, charged with inciting violence and ordering the killing of an Israeli soldier. He was released in 1997 after King Hussein of Jordan struck a deal with Israel.Following Yassin’s death, Abdel Aziz Rantisi was named as his successor, though Rantisi was killed in an Israeli airstrike less than a month later.Abdel Aziz Rantisi had been the top Hamas leader inside the Gaza Strip for barely a month when an Israeli helicopter fired two missiles on his white Subaru sedan in the streets of Gaza and assassinated him alongside two bodyguards in April 2004. He was 54.Rantisi had taken the helm after Yassin’s assassination in March. Formerly a pediatrician, Rantisi was known for his lack of compromise with Israel and could mobilize tens of thousands of Palestinians into the streets within hours.The missiles had come three days after President George W. Bush met with former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and vowed “to wipe out Palestinian terrorism, which they see as a prerequisite to establishing an independent Palestinian state,” according to a Post story from 2004.Israel defended the assassination.“We are preventing terrorist attacks, and part of the prevention is to go after terrorists like Rantisi,” said Gideon Meir, deputy director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. “Anyone who will replace him and will continue this business of terrorism against Israel is a legitimate target.”Rantisi was taken to al-Shifa Hospital, where he died.“Israel will regret this — revenge is coming,” Ismail Haniyeh told reporters at the hospital at the time. “This blood will not be wasted. … The battle will not weaken our determination or break our will.”Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas operative, was assassinated in a hotel room in Dubai in January 2010. Hamas officials accused Israel of the killing and vowed revenge.Israeli officials, in keeping with standard policy on such allegations, did not comment, The Post reported at the time.Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and was widely known for his involvement in the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers in 1989, The Post reported.Citing medical reports supplied to the family, Mabhouh's brother said the documents indicated that Mabhouh had been subjected to electric shocks and strangulation.Dubai's official media office did not mention a cause of death but quoted police and security officials who said Mabhouh entered the country Jan. 19 and was found dead within a day, suggesting that his movements were being tracked.Cate Brown, Susannah George and Mohamad El Chamaa contributed to this report."
WaPo_93,"Norma Padgett, accuser of exonerated ‘Groveland Four,’ dies at 92",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/31/norma-padgett-groveland-four-dies/,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"In the predawn hours of July 16, 1949, a young White couple — Norma Lee Padgett and her husband, Willie — were driving along a desolate road in central Florida after a night of whiskey drinking and dancing at the local American Legion hall.They were near the rural crossroads of Okahumpka, on the way to get a bite to eat, when their Ford stalled. After no one else stopped to assist them, two Black men in a sedan rolled up and asked if the couple needed help. The Padgetts later said a fight broke out that left Willie Padgett lying in a ditch. What ignited the fight, and whether it even took place, has not been conclusively established.At daybreak, after walking several miles, 17-year-old Ms. Padgett appeared on foot at a dine-and-dance club in Okahumpka and asked the night watchman for a ride to her home down the road in Groveland, an agricultural town also in Lake County. Once there, Ms. Padgett told authorities that the Black men — whom she said were four in number — had beaten her husband, then drove her away in their car at gunpoint and took turns raping her in the back seat before releasing her.Ms. Padgett, whose accusation precipitated what is now recognized as a grotesque miscarriage of justice in the Jim Crow South, died July 12 at 92.The Washington Post obtained a copy of her death certificate from the vital records office of the probate court in Taylor County, Ga. According to the death certificate, she died at her home in Butler, Ga. No cause of death was listed. Efforts to reach members of Ms. Padgett’s family were unsuccessful or were declined.It would take seven decades for the state of Florida to offer a posthumous pardon and then exonerate the men — long known by advocates as the Groveland Four — who were picked up by local deputies under a segregationist sheriff known for his brutal approach to law enforcement.Ms. Padgett refused to publicly recant her story. “I’m not no liar,” she insisted, at age 86, before a clemency board in 2019. “They done it.”But after two books — one in 2003 and another in 2012 — examined the case and a mountain of long-suppressed evidence against her claim emerged, credence in Ms. Padgett’s allegation dissolved. It was replaced by the horror that her charge had left two Black men gunned down — Ernest Thomas was killed in 1949 and Samuel Shepherd in 1951 — and sent two others to prison, Charles Greenlee for 12 years and Walter Irvin for 18½ years. Irvin was nearly sent to the electric chair in 1954.The case continues to resonate across the South and beyond, as ever more stories have emerged of concocted evidence, coerced confessions and abuses of the law to enforce Jim Crow-era white domination, said Gilbert King, author of “Devil in the Grove,” which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction and heightened interest in the case.“There are a lot of Black families that have been gaslighted,” King said in an interview. “They know what the truth is. They know these stories are out there, and they never get anywhere. There’s no judicial relief.”In the case of the Groveland Four, King noted, the FBI conducted its own investigation parallel to the sham prosecution in Lake County, and King obtained unredacted FBI files during his research. “They put together a story that was undeniable, in my estimation,” King said.The maelstrom let loose by Ms. Padgett unfolded in a 20-mile radius around her hometown in Lake County, a citrus-growing region west of Orlando where White farmers, backed by the muscle of the Ku Klux Klan, relied on low-paid Black workers to tend to the orange trees.It was in that area that Norma Lee Tyson was born on March 10, 1932, the date recorded on her Florida driver’s license. She grew up in Bay Lake, a place southeast of Groveland that was described in a news account as a community of wooden farm shacks. According to her death certificate, she obtained an eighth-grade education and worked in fruit processing.She was six months into an already turbulent marriage to Willie Padgett and was separated from him, living back on her family farm, when they met for a night of partying in the hope of reconciliation. The source of their marital trouble was never made public, but Willie Padgett, in his early 20s at the time, was rumored to have a violent temper, King wrote in “Devil in the Grove.”Within hours of hearing Ms. Padgett’s allegations, deputies under Lake County Sheriff Willis V. McCall had rounded up Irvin and Shepherd, both 22-year-old Army veterans of World War II, who were sleeping in a car and identified by Ms. Padgett as culprits.They also took custody of Greenlee, a 16-year-old in possession of an unloaded pistol who was initially charged with vagrancy at a gas station. When Ms. Padgett implicated Greenlee, the accusation triggered a manhunt for Thomas, a friend of his.McCall led a deputized mob of more than 1,000 men with bloodhounds on a 30-hour hunt for Thomas, 26, who had fled through a cypress swamp in Madison County near the Georgia border. McCall told reporters that Thomas had been “belligerent as the devil” before he was killed in a fusillade of bullets, and the killing was ruled a justifiable homicide.Meanwhile, White Groveland residents, including Ms. Padgett’s father, stormed the Black areas of the town, discharging weapons and setting homes afire. Florida’s governor called in the National Guard for six days to quell the uprising.When the rape trial opened before an all-White jury at the Lake County courthouse, Ms. Padgett — dressed in her best Sunday clothes — repeatedly used a racial epithet to identify the three defendants in the packed courtroom: Irvin, Shepherd and Greenlee.A jury deliberated for 90 minutes before returning guilty verdicts, convinced by a prosecutor that the defendants had confessed to the sheriff. Jurors did not see their bruises from beatings in which they were handcuffed to overhead pipes and pummeled with batons, the defendants later told NAACP attorneys.Other exculpatory evidence was kept from the defense, including a medical report from a physician, Geoffrey Binneveld, who examined Ms. Padgett hours after her alleged assault and told FBI investigators that he found “no spermatozoa was present.”Jurors also were not told that Greenlee was in custody for vagrancy 20 miles from the scene of the alleged assault at the time it was said to have occurred.Newspapers highlighted other inconsistencies. The St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) reported in 1950 that Ms. Padgett claimed to be “crying profusely and visibly shaken” when she first encountered the night watchman.But the watchman told the newspaper that she was “extremely calm” and that even though she claimed to have been held captive, she said the men had “not harmed her.” Moreover, she told him, according to the paper, that “she had not seen her captors clearly enough to be able to identify them.”The case drew the attention of a rising NAACP lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, who in 1951 appealed the death penalty verdicts for Irvin and Shepherd to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court, where Marshall would years later sit as the first Black justice, unanimously overturned the verdicts.“This case presents one of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to American justice,” Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote in the majority opinion, noting the racial bias of the jury and inflammatory media accounts that assumed the men’s guilt.As a minor, Greenlee had been given a life prison sentence, not the death penalty, and did not appeal his case, after his lawyers told him a new jury might be less sympathetic and order his execution. He was paroled in 1962 after 12 years in prison.A retrial was ordered for Irvin and Shepherd. While driving them from the Florida State Prison in Raiford to the Lake County jail for retrial in late 1951, McCall pulled off a back road and shot both prisoners. Shepherd died, while Irvin survived by playing dead. The sheriff claimed the handcuffed prisoners tried to attack him when he stopped to check a tire.“He made Bull Connor look like Barney Fife,” King later told the New York Times, referring to the brutal commissioner of public safety in Birmingham, Ala., during the civil rights era and the dimwitted deputy sheriff on “The Andy Griffith Show.” “Connor used dogs and fire hoses. McCall actually killed people.”Three years later, after Irvin was retried and again found guilty, he narrowly escaped execution in the electric chair and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was paroled in 1968 and found dead in his car a year later when he returned to Groveland for a funeral.The Padgetts remained married through the trial and retrial of the rape case, but Willie Padgett tangled with the law on several occasions, spending jail time for felony sexual assault, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, fraud and vehicle theft, according to a 2017 article in the Atlantic by King.The Padgetts divorced in 1958. Ms. Padgett dwelled in the Groveland area for nearly half a century, maintaining a public silence about the alleged attack. She eventually moved to a mobile home at the end of a dirt road near Butler and used the surname of her second husband, Thermon Upshaw, who worked as a heavy equipment operator.A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.She came forth to defend her original story on Jan. 11, 2019, as Florida’s Board of Executive Clemency considered a posthumous pardon for the Groveland Four.“I’m the victim of that night,” she said from a wheelchair, her short white hair combed back over her head, her voice trembling. “Y’all just don’t know what kind of horror I’ve been through for all these many years. … I’m beggin’ y’all not to give them pardon because they done it. … And that’s all I got to say, ’cause I know I’m telling the truth.”But lawyers for the state reached the opposite conclusion. Further evidence had come to light from unredacted FBI files, internal documents from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and a new interview with a descendant of a key protagonist.That descendant was the grandson of Jesse Hunter, the state attorney who prosecuted the case. Broward Hunter found letters in his grandfather’s dusty law office that he said showed neither his grandfather nor the judge believed a rape had ever occurred.Moreover, Broward Hunter said the letters indicated McCall “was involved” in local gambling operations and rounded up defendants Thomas and Greenlee because he believed they worked for a competitor and “he was eliminating competition,” according to a partial transcript of an interview with Broward Hunter included in the state’s legal motion in October 2021 to have the guilty verdicts of the Groveland Four cases set aside.“I have not witnessed a more complete breakdown of the criminal justice system,” wrote William Gladson, a state attorney and the author of that motion.An exoneration of the four Black men was granted a month later.Sharon Dunten in Butler, Ga.; Susan Cooper Eastman in Jacksonville, Fla.; Gabrielle Russon in Lake County, Fla.; and Aaron Schaffer, Alice Crites and Emily Langer contributed to this report."

WaPo_95,Guinean court finds former president guilty of crimes against humanity,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/guinea-camara-trial-stadium-massacre/,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"CONAKRY, Guinea — A Guinean court ruled Wednesday that the country’s former president and other leaders had committed crimes against humanity in connection with a massacre and mass rape carried out 15 years ago by security forces.Former president Moussa Dadis Camara was found guilty based on his “command responsibility,” sentenced to 20 years in prison and ordered to pay reparations.The landmark trial centered on the events of Sept. 28, 2009, when Guinean security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters calling for democracy inside a stadium in the capital, Conakry. Camara was among 11 leaders, including one of his top aides and two government ministers, who were charged in the case, which kicked off in September 2022 after more than a decade of calls by victims and their families for justice.More than 150 civilians were killed and more than 100 women raped by forces who then tried to cover it up, according to a United Nations commission and accounts collected by Human Rights Watch. Lawyers for the victims had asked for life sentences for seven of the 11 defendants, including Camara, and reparations for the psychological and physical harm done to victims.Camara and nine other defendants sat next to each other in court Wednesday, their faces largely implacable as a judge spent several hours reading the charges and verdict in the case. The 11th defendant, Col. Claude Pivi, who was minister for presidential security, escaped from a detention facility in November 2023 and remains at large.Human rights experts warned that despite the verdict, there remain concerns about repression by Guinea’s government, which has been since 2021 run by a military junta. Lawyers for both the plaintiffs and defendants boycotted the trial on Wednesday, sending their assistants, because of a nationwide strike announced two weeks ago by the Guinean Bar Association over arbitrary arrests and secret detentions allegedly carried out by the junta.Two prominent activists from the opposition party were detained earlier this month and are being held in an undisclosed location. The arrests are part of a broader crackdown on civil liberties that has been documented by Amnesty International and includes the suspension of media outlets and the killing of protesters.When the trial opened, survivors recounted the horrors they experienced. Djenabou Bah said she was just 9 years old when she headed with her friends to the stadium, where soldiers stabbed and raped her. Oumar Diallo recounted how a soldier broke his arms with a rifle, which prevented him from working as a truck driver for years afterward. Saran Cissé recalled begging security forces to kill her instead of rape her. They did not listen.“I’m scared,” Cissé said in an interview this week. “I want truth and reparations.”Cissé said she and other victims are nervous about their safety and that of their families. She said many of those who committed the atrocities in 2009 remain free. “Everyone knows where I live, how I go out, how I dress, everyone knows,” said Cissé, who called for help to leave Conakry, even if just for a few months. “It is the same for all the victims.”Aminata Soura Diallo, who was stabbed by a soldier in the chest during the protests in 2009, said she did not have enough money to treat her wound after the massacre and has suffered for years afterward.“We want truth to win,” she said in an interview. “There are many victims who have died, who are sick, who don’t have any hope for reparations.”"
WaPo_96,The odds of a new Atlantic tropical storm are growing,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/31/tropical-storm-debby-united-states/,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"Odds are growing that a tropical storm will form in the Atlantic, probably not far from the United States, by the weekend.The National Hurricane Center continues to monitor a tropical disturbance near Puerto Rico, which it says has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical storm or depression (the precursor to a storm) over the next seven days.“Debby” is the next name up on the agency’s storm list. There are increasing chances that a storm by that name will be born, although it’s not a certainty.The biggest question is where the system will track as it edges closer to the United States. Unfortunately, the forecast is just as hazy as it was on Monday.Weather models remain firmly split in their track predictions. The European model paints a picture of a storm grazing the southeast coast of the United States before being swept out to sea, while the American model spells big problems for the Gulf of Mexico. The Canadian model, meanwhile, is somewhere in between.Regardless of which model is right in the end, blustery and squally weather should arrive in the Bahamas by Thursday afternoon, with Friday being a pivotal day to see how the forecast evolves. Interests in the southeast United States, as well as along the Gulf Coast, should keep close tabs on the system’s progress.It’s early in hurricane season, which historically tends to ramp up markedly during the back half of August. The Atlantic’s first hurricane forms on average around Aug. 11, with major hurricanes, rated Category 3 or higher, more probable in September.Of course, that didn’t stop Beryl from becoming the earliest-forming Category 5 hurricane on record in early July.A combination of near record-warm Atlantic waters, as well as increased rising motion in the air courtesy of a burgeoning La Niña pattern, is predicted to make this season particularly active.As of Wednesday, the broad, disorganized tropical wave was between Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands, which mark a boundary between the open tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. It’s not very strong but is producing more showers and thunderstorms than it was on Monday or Tuesday.The uptick in shower activity will moisten the surrounding atmosphere, paving the way for gradual organization. The system is still fending off some dry air at the mid-levels, though it’s moving into a pocket of higher humidity.It is also being tempered by harsh, high-altitude winds to the north. The environment will become gradually more conducive to development by late Thursday or Friday as it approaches the southwest Bahamas, northeast Cuba or just northwest of Haiti.There are increasing odds that a tropical storm or hurricane will develop eventually. But where and when that happens is predicated on the slowly organizing system surviving interactions with any of the Caribbean islands. As tropical systems encounter land areas, they tend to weaken.While this system is disorganized, a more concentrated lobe of spin will probably evolve over the next few days, around which a storm will develop. The wild card is where.The American (GFS) model, for example, simulates that happening south of Cuba. That would prime the system to enter the Gulf of Mexico.The European model, conversely, depicts consolidation of a storm center to the north of Cuba, which would allow a more northerly track offshore of the Eastern Seaboard.The Canadian model suggests an outcome somewhere in between. Any interactions with land masses, such as Cuba, will slow down potential storm development and complicate the forecast even more.Because there is a wide range of possibilities as to where (and when) the storm will form, the long-term track forecast is particularly challenging. Here are two scenarios:Scenario 1: Storm nears the southeast coastIf the system forms north of Cuba, as the European modeling system suggests, it will be more prone to capture by a dip in the jet stream approaching the U.S. East Coast between Sunday and Tuesday.That would probably push the storm out to sea but allow a close enough pass for rough surf and rip currents from the Florida Keys to the Outer Banks. There’s a chance that rain, strong winds and an ocean surge could affect coastal areas if the storm gets absorbed by the jet stream close enough to shore.Scenario 2: Storm enters the Gulf of MexicoIf the system isn’t captured by the jet stream and manages to continue chugging westward and ends up in the gulf, it would probably strengthen because of very warm water temperatures. It could then make landfall in the eastern gulf sometime Monday or Tuesday.There’s also an outside chance the storm could progress into the western gulf, allowing it to remain over water longer and strengthen further. In this unlikely scenario, it could come ashore in the western gulf around midweek.A caveatAny scenarios depend on the formation of a storm, which itself is not a certainty. It’s important to keep abreast of the evolving forecasts.Aside from this potential storm, there are no other tropical threats to monitor in the Atlantic. But come mid-August, a zone of increased upward-moving air will spread over the Atlantic. That’s in association with the MJO, or Madden-Julian Oscillation, a large-scale overturning circulation that meanders eastward through the global tropics. That would bolster the risk of tropical storms and hurricanes between Aug. 15 and Aug. 31."
WaPo_97,Arizona county official who took on election skeptics loses primary,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/stephen-richer-maricopa-county-arizona-primary/,2024-08-01 01:28:02.623376,,"PHOENIX — A top Republican election official in Arizona’s most populous county known for his vigorous defense of elections lost his primary Tuesday to a state lawmaker who called elections in the county “a laughingstock.”Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, who faced death threats and endless harassment for doing his job, lost his reelection bid to state Rep. Justin Heap, an attorney aligned with the state legislature’s ultraconservative Freedom Caucus. Heap has voted for legislation that grew out of false election theories and was endorsed by Kari Lake, the U.S. Senate candidate with a large following who routinely spreads misinformation about elections and has been highly critical of Richer.As Heap campaigned for the job, he pledged to try to improve confidence in elections and engage with the public in a respectful manner.“It has become clear that ensuring the right of every citizen to have confidence in their vote, regardless of party, has become the civil rights issue of our time,” Heap said during a June debate. “Unfortunately, our current county recorder has taken a different path, a path that disrespects and demeans the voters. A path that attacks anyone who criticizes his office and laughs off even the suggestion that there might be anything wrong with our election system.”Richer congratulated Heap on his win Wednesday morning, writing on X: “Elections have winners and, sadly, losers. And in this one, it looks like I’m going to end up on the losing side of the column. But that’s the name of the game. Accept it. Move on.”In the November general election, Heap will face Democrat Tim Stringham, a U.S. Army and Navy veteran and political newcomer who is campaigning on a promise to “safeguard our elections” and “ensure that each eligible citizen gets to vote in a safe, secure and convenient way and that each vote will be counted fairly and transparently.” That race is expected to be competitive, political analysts say. Stringham is now asking Richer’s supporters to coalesce behind him.“If you voted for Stephen Richer, I imagine you did so because of his honesty in the face of lies over the last four years,” Stringham wrote on X. “I’m asking you to continue to vote for the honest candidate.”If Heap wins in November, he could dramatically reshape how elections are run in the county, a fiercely contested battleground where former president Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election four years ago inspired profound mistrust among many Republicans about elections and government institutions. That movement sparked a rush of new involvement and activated pro-Trump voters determined to oust local officials who defend election results they don’t like, including Richer and members of the county governing board. Richer will continue to help run the upcoming presidential election, then leave office next year.When Trump narrowly lost Arizona to Joe Biden in 2020, he and his supporters quickly hyper-focused on Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and more than half of the swing state’s voters. Through emissaries, phone calls and text message, they sought to halt vote-counting and then tried to undermine the results. Republicans on the county board of supervisors who signed off on the results faced death threats and were called treasonous. A mob of protesters showed up at the home of one supervisor. Soon after, Richer took office.Of the three remaining Republicans who were on the board in 2020, two decided not to run for reelection and a third, Jack Sellers, lost his primary on Tuesday. The Republicans running for those seats have said they would work to make elections more transparent. One of those Republicans, Trump-endorsed Rep. Debbie Lesko, voted against accepting the 2020 election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania on Jan. 6, 2021. Another has advocated for getting rid of precinct-based voting and emergency ballot drop boxes.“To the election deniers who have dedicated so much time, energy, and money to defeat me and others, I say: be careful what you wish for,” Sellers said in a statement that praised county elections. “At some point you will have to answer for your efforts to undermine our democracy.”Republican county attorney Rachel Mitchell, who has told members of her own party that Biden won the 2020 vote and that the 2022 elections in the state were accurate and legitimate, easily won her race against a further-right candidate. And a GOP supervisor, who joined the board after the 2020 election and was called a “traitor” for defending the validity of electoral outcomes, won his reelection.Richer and the Republican supervisors shared election responsibilities and generally shared a similar vision on how voting should be run, how votes should be counted and how election employees should be defended. New leaders could take the county in a radically different direction.Richer was endorsed by several traditional Republicans, including former governors Doug Ducey and Jan Brewer.“For being the ‘establishment candidate,’ having the county party, the state party, Turning Point USA, Lakeworld, Trumpworld all against me — that’s hard to run against,” Richer said in an interview shortly before results began posting.Richer, an attorney, assumed the once-sleepy job of helping run elections and recording documents in 2021, after he beat the Democratic incumbent in the 2020 election. He stepped into the job as Trump, his allies and supporters tried to overturn the former president’s 10,457-vote defeat and then turned against county and state Republicans who refused. Richer had nothing to do with the administration of that presidential election but took heat for it, anyway.In that environment, Richer began sharing his view from inside of the recorder’s office in downtown Phoenix in the hopes of making it easier to understand complex voting rules and procedures.Like an FAQ come to life, Richer threw himself into trying to make elections less mysterious, blasting out social media posts that fact-checked people who amplified misinformation — treating everyday constituents and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, all the same. Richer gave tours of the county’s vote-count operation, taking the curious into the bowels of the process and explaining how he kept voter rolls updated.His approach drew praise from national election officials but ire from further-right Republicans who viewed him as dismissive of their concerns. Richer found himself in the eye of attacks after the 2022 midterm general election, when printer malfunctions at dozens of voting sites caused confusion and inconvenienced some voters. Lake, who lost her campaign for governor that year by about 17,000 votes, falsely claimed that Richer deliberately rigged the election to prevent her from winning. Death threats and harassment followed.In a rare move, Richer sued Lake for defamation in June 2023, saying he saw a direct link between her rhetoric and threats against him. Lake has declined to defend herself against the lawsuit and asked a judge to begin the process of assessing damages.Christine Jones, a Republican attorney and former GOP candidate who closely follows the state’s elections, said two things weighed against Richer with primary voters.“His tone: He’s a little sarcastic and a little snarky and some of that is defensive because he was attacked and had death threats,” she said. “The second thing: He sued Kari Lake for defamation, which had the effect of pitting more than half of Republican primary voters against him.”As he ran for reelection, Richer campaigned at events hosted by grass-roots Republicans — the type of forums his GOP colleagues at the county stopped attending after they gave way to shouting by those who wanted confrontations. Richer himself was sometimes heckled or booed. In March, a vice chair of the Maricopa County Republican Committee told a crowd that she would “lynch” Richer if he walked in the room. She later described her comment as a joke.In the final stretch of the campaign, Richer handed his GOP rivals a gift, telling reporters that he would vote for Biden, not Trump, in November. His comments came before Biden’s June 27 shaky debate performance and eventual withdrawal from the race.“DID YOU KNOW that the current fake-Republican County Recorder, Stephen Richer, has admitted he’s voting for Joe Biden,” Heap wrote on X on June 28. He continued, “Say NO to Stephen Richer & Joe Biden’s epic failures.”"
WaPo_98,Giuliani may avoid testimony in bankruptcy case amid settlement on fees,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/rudy-giuliani-bankruptcy-testimony/,2024-08-01 01:00:02.623376,,"Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani may avoid having to testify under oath about his finances after he reached a last-minute agreement with his creditors to pay an estimated $350,000 in administrative fees tied to his bankruptcy case, paving the way for its dismissal.Lawyers for Giuliani and several creditors, including two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation claim against the former mayor, announced in a letter sent Wednesday morning to the judge overseeing Giuliani’s bankruptcy case that they had “conferred and reached agreement” to settle fees and move forward with dismissal.A proposed order attached to the letter stated that Giuliani agreed to transfer $100,000 to an escrow account controlled by his attorneys and satisfy the remainder of the fees with proceeds from the sale of one of his two properties — his New York apartment or his condo in Palm Beach, Fla.The proposal says a lien will be placed on both properties “as security” to make sure Giuliani pays fees owed to Global Risk Data, an accounting firm retained by the creditors to investigate his finances, but it also says the firm cannot seek to foreclose on or take other action related to either property for six months after the judge approves the agreement.Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the former Georgia election workers whom Giuliani falsely accused of helping to steal the 2020 presidential election, have previously sought to gain control of those properties and are expected to file suit seeking that real estate and Giuliani’s other assets once the bankruptcy case is formally dismissed. The proposed order says if they receive proceeds from the sale of either property, they will pay what is owed to GRD.A spokesman for Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The agreement must first be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in the Southern District of New York, who last week threatened to reverse his decision to dismiss Giuliani’s bankruptcy case after Giuliani claimed he did not “have the ability to pay” the administrative fees — which must be resolved before the case can be closed.Lane, who has been critical of Giuliani’s lack of financial transparency throughout the proceedings, was skeptical of the former mayor’s claim that he doesn’t have the money, citing Giuliani’s ownership of two apartments that are of “considerable value.”“What little we know about the Debtor’s financial situation makes his stance here more troubling,” Lane wrote. “Even assuming that the Debtor does not have the funds on hand to immediately pay these bankruptcy expenses, he certainly has considerable assets upon which he can draw to pay such expenses.”Lane threatened to hold an evidentiary hearing and require Giuliani to give sworn testimony about the state of his finances. But he gave the former mayor and his creditors until noon Wednesday to submit a letter with their suggestions of how to move forward. The proposed joint agreement was filed about three hours before that deadline.The developments come nearly three weeks after Lane threw out Giuliani’s bankruptcy case, paving the way for numerous creditors, including Freeman and Moss, to pursue and potentially seize his assets.But within days of that order, a dispute emerged over fees incurred by GRD, an investigative accounting firm made up of former CIA and FBI officials hired by the creditors to probe Giuliani’s finances. The firm was retained after Giuliani repeatedly failed to fully disclose his cash and assets, including information about his businesses and other holdings that is required in bankruptcy proceedings — a lack of transparency the judge called “troubling.”Rachel Strickland, an attorney for Freeman and Moss, pressed Lane to order Giuliani to turn over all the cash in his bank account and control of his New York apartment to satisfy court fees — a request the judge called “premature.” But in a July 17 hearing, Strickland urged the judge to take action quickly, accusing Giuliani of financial “shenanigans” and continuing to spend freely without authorization from the court.Strickland said records from the only bank account Giuliani disclosed to creditors showed that he had burned through more than half of the $60,000 in the account after Lane agreed to dismiss the bankruptcy case — including $39,000 in fees related to his Florida condo and New York apartment. Giuliani also spent money on travel and other expenses related to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, she claimed.Giuliani’s attorneys later clarified that his travel to the convention was paid for by a media company linked to My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, a fellow election denier and Trump associate who recently hired Giuliani.Wednesday’s agreement comes seven months after Giuliani sought bankruptcy protection after he was ordered to immediately pay millions in damages to Freeman and Moss for the false claims he made about them in the aftermath of the 2020 election when he was serving as President Donald Trump’s personal attorney.In court documents, Giuliani has listed roughly $153 million in debts to at least 20 people and businesses, including Freeman and Moss. A list of top creditors filed in February said Giuliani owes more than $3.7 million in unpaid legal fees to three law firms — though he is disputing some of those bills — and more than $1 million in state and federal taxes.The former federal prosecutor has claimed about $11 million in assets — including an estimated $5.6 million New York apartment and his Palm Beach condo, which is valued at $3.5 million. While Giuliani has put his New York property on the market, he had resisted selling his Florida home, with one of his lawyers claiming the sale could render the 80-year-old former mayor “homeless.”The proposed agreement filed Wednesday suggested the Florida condo could soon be listed for sale.A financial disclosure report filed in June said Giuliani had less than $100,000 in the bank at the end of May and was funding his living expenses through a rapidly diminishing retirement account. But creditors have repeatedly complained that Giuliani has not filed a complete picture of his net worth and have accused him of hiding money and assets.Giuliani had repeatedly shifted legal strategies in recent weeks amid complaints from the judge and his creditors that he was not being fully transparent about his finances.In December, he sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which allows an individual to reorganize and file a plan to pay off debts. But on July 1, Giuliani asked the judge to reclassify his case under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which would hand control of his personal and business finances to an outside trustee to liquidate. The request prompted immediate objections from the election workers and other creditors, who accused Giuliani of more delay tactics.On July 10, an hour before a hearing on the matter, Giuliani abruptly switched position yet again, asking Lane to dismiss the bankruptcy case altogether. While some of the creditors pressed the judge to appoint a trustee, Freeman and Moss supported the dismissal and Lane ultimately agreed — saying there was no evidence that Giuliani’s “uncooperative conduct will change.” Lane granted that motion on July 12 — but has not yet finalized it.A dismissal would allow Freeman and Moss and other creditors to immediately pursue legal remedies to collect money owed to them by Giuliani.It also allows other pending lawsuits against the former mayor that had been frozen by the bankruptcy proceeding to resume, including defamation suits by the voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic and a sexual harassment and wage theft claim by former Giuliani associate Noelle Dunphy. All are part of a committee of “unsecured creditors” that had sought relief in the bankruptcy case.Giuliani has publicly suggested that he will seek to appeal the defamation judgment in the election worker case — which he was prohibited from doing while seeking bankruptcy protection because litigation against him had been stayed. But the judge in that case has said Giuliani must put up a $148 million bond to pursue the appeal and pause collection efforts by Freeman and Moss, and it was not clear Giuliani had the funds to do that."
WaPo_99,"D.C. exhibit celebrates the Jewish deli — and, yes, it’s worth the schlep",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/jewish-deli-museum-exhibit/,2024-08-01 00:00:02.623376,,"The video montage that closes out the Capital Jewish Museum’s exhibit “‘I’ll Have What She’s Having’: The Jewish Deli” might claim that titular quote from “When Harry Met Sally” as its most famous pop cultural moment. But it’s preceded by another clip, from a 2011 “Saturday Night Live” episode, that better exemplifies the deli’s place in Jewish humor, and vice versa. In it, Andy Samberg plays “Jewish Willy Wonka,” about to take Ben Stiller into his magical factory of pickles and knishes.“It’s every taste you’ve ever dreamed of — from salty to fishy!” says Samberg, who sings: “If it’s bad, that’s fun, too, ’cause it’s also fun complaining.”Like a good pastrami sandwich, the exhibition is multilayered and tender, with a peppery kick here and there. Curated by the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles with additional D.C. artifacts added by the Capital Jewish Museum’s local curators, “I’ll Have What She’s Having” chronicles the history of Jewish casual dining in the United States from humble horse-and-buggy operations to sleek modern counters, with an examination of politics, geography and identity throughout. It also serves as a celebration of Jewish food at the downtown D.C. museum, which opened its doors last summer.“Delicatessen is a fusion food born of immigration,” says Cate Thurston, chief curator at the Skirball. “This influx of people created, through combining foodways, a beloved American tradition that is an important part of Jewish American culture.”But first: the food. You’ll grow an appetite, inevitably, perusing the collection of illustrated historical menus full of deli classics: not just Reubens, pickles and matzoh ball soup, but also kasha varnishkes (a buckwheat and pasta dish), blintzes (rolled crepes with a sweet cheese filling) and egg creams (a fizzy chocolate drink that doesn’t actually contain egg). Some, like the pastrami sandwich, are represented with hyper-realistic sculptures commissioned for the exhibition.But the company that fabricated the fake food didn’t get the order quite right. “The yellow mustard with the pastrami sandwich looked too much like cheese,” says Thurston. (Cheese on pastrami is not kosher.) “Our preparator team was out there with an X-Acto knife a couple of days before the exhibition first opened.”From sepia-tinted footage of deli workers explaining the bagel-making process in thick New Yawk accents to artifacts from legendary wisecracking restaurateur Max Asnas — the “Corned Beef Confucius” — the curators shift focus from what’s on the plate to who’s behind the counter, and what these businesses mean to the community.“You have these spaces that are just alive with people and food and talking and movement,” Thurston says.But back to immigration. Many of the foods that are now considered classics of the genre weren’t necessarily served together before Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe moved to the United States and brought their regional dishes with them. It’s also a story of adaptation, given the casual relationship many “Jewish-style” non-kosher delis have with Jewish dietary laws: Their most famous sandwich, the Reuben, mixes meat and dairy, and bacon even makes an appearance on some sandwiches.The exhibition also examines the deli as a place of both inclusion and exclusion. Jewish delis became a secular place where their clientele, who were historically restricted from purchasing real estate in certain neighborhoods, could belong. And many of the stories of restaurateurs — some of whom were Holocaust survivors — emphasize their dedication to welcoming everyone. But one wall also tells the story of an Atlanta Jewish deli that excluded Black patrons until forced by the 1964 Civil Rights Act to integrate.The traveling exhibition has incorporated new scholarship and artifacts to include D.C.’s culinary heritage, even though our offerings aren’t as robust as those from New York and Los Angeles. Our reputation has never been that of a “deli city,” but D.C.’s Jewish-owned District Grocery Stores and the long-operating Parkway Deli in Silver Spring (where a Reuben used to cost $4.35 in the 1980s) get their due. (For a new entry into D.C.’s deli scene, check out our story on Beresovsky’s, in Navy Yard.)The number of Jewish-style delis and restaurants in the United States has declined dramatically since its mid-century peak, but Thurston doesn’t believe these spaces are in danger of disappearing completely. Restaurants using techniques and ingredients inspired by traditional delis — like D.C.’s Buffalo and Bergen, which is expanding to Cleveland Park — have proliferated.“That thread of delis as a home away from home hasn’t changed, even if delis may look a little different in the 21st century,” says Thurston.Salty, fishy, malty, kitschy and — you knew it was coming — here’s the complaint: If only there were a tasting at the end.Thurston knows: “I hope that people leave hungry.”Lillian and Albert Small Capital Jewish Museum, 575 Third St. NW. 202-789-0900. capitaljewishmuseum.org.Dates: Through Sept. 1.Price: Free-$15."

WaPo_103,Fed keeps interest rates steady. But cuts aren’t far off.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/31/fed-rate-cuts-inflation/,2024-08-01 01:59:02.623376,,"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady on Wednesday — with officials inching closer to a long-awaited rate cut that might come as soon as September.Households and businesses are eager for central bankers to bring borrowing costs down from the highest level in 23 years. Rates have held steady since last July. So far, the Fed has been wary of taking even a little bit of pressure off the economy before officials are confident inflation is heading back to normal levels. But the past few months of encouraging data have Wall Street and financial analysts betting the Fed is as close as it could get — and some worry the central bank could even be waiting too long to ease up.At the end of their two-day policy meeting, Fed leaders said the economy was still growing at a “solid pace"" and that the unemployment rate had ticked up slightly but remains low. Even though inflation has eased, the path ahead is still uncertain.“The committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent,” central bankers wrote in a statement, offering no specific timeline.At 2:30 p.m. Eastern, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell will take questions at a news conference, where he’ll probably be asked about the Fed’s fight against inflation, the health of the job market and timing for future cuts.The last time officials convened, in June, they penciled in just one rate cut before the end of the year, down from three a few months before that. The Fed won’t issue official projections again until September. But in the meantime, Powell could shed some light on where he and his colleagues think policy is headed — and if they even have time to cut rates during the handful of meetings left in the year.The practiced and staid Fed chief generally holds back from forecasting too far into the future. Instead, he and his colleagues have been focused on building confidence that inflation is falling reliably down on its way to a more normal 2 percent. That’s clearly what the data show; using the Fed’s preferred gauge, inflation clocked in at 2.5 percent in June.If anything, some economists are puzzled over why the Fed isn’t cutting rates already.“We want to have greater confidence inflation was moving sustainably down toward our 2 percent target, and what increases our confidence in that is more good inflation data,” Powell said at the Economic Club of D.C. this month. “And lately here, we have been getting some of that.”Fed officials are taking their time because they’ve been thwarted by the economy’s unexpected turns before. At the start of the year, a slew of hot inflation reports suggested the Fed was losing ground on its push to slow the economy, after things looked like they were cruising late in 2023. Well before that, the Fed was slow to react when prices surged in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — a mistake that forced the central bank to hoist borrowing costs in a rush to catch up. They ultimately brought the federal funds rate to between 5.25 and 5.5 percent.Through it all, though, the Fed has managed a rare feat: bringing inflation down without causing a recession or blow to the job market. The economy grew at a surprisingly strong 2.8 percent in the second quarter, capping two years of solid expansion. The extreme labor shortages from the pandemic have also faded away, but employers are still hiring.In the backdrop is the presidential election, where Republicans and Democrats are campaigning on vastly different plans for the economy. While the Fed is loath to get involved in politics, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Many economists, for example, warn that former president Donald Trump’s policies on higher tariffs and mass deportations would worsen inflation. If he wins in November and his agenda becomes law, the Fed’s inflation fight could be upended.In the meantime, some Fed watchers are antsy for the first cut. They argue rates that stay too high for too long can backfire, causing cracks in the labor market if employers pull back or even lay people off. Those signs haven’t emerged yet. But officials have acknowledged that they have to balance their inflation goals with protecting the labor market more evenly than they have over the past few years.The official statement will get plenty of attention ahead of Powell’s news conference. That’s because the central bank moves in subtle but consequential ways; slight word changes from one statement to the next have the power to move markets. And they shed light on what officials think is important.When Fed leaders wrapped up their June meeting, they wrote that they were still “highly attentive to inflation risks.” That sentence got a notable revision on Wednesday, with the Fed saying it was “attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.”For the economy as a whole, it might not matter much if the Fed cuts in July versus September. Rather, it’s about the signal. Speaking to The Washington Post this month, Boston Fed President Susan Collins noted how bumpy the inflation fight has been. That makes it especially important that “we really stay the course” while keeping a close eye on any other emerging risks.“From my perspective, I have gained some confidence with the last three months,” Collins said on inflation. She added: “I think we’re not quite there yet.”Eric Rosengren, who ran the Boston Fed from 2007 to 2021, said it was too soon to know if the Fed will cut more than once — largely because of the presidential election. After September, the Fed’s remaining meetings for 2024 are the week of the election in November and then again in December. To avoid political backlash, the Fed would probably steer clear of a rate cut in November. But by December, the economy may be headed in different directions depending on who wins.“We have two candidates who have very different fiscal policies, and at least some of those fiscal policies could start changing the forecast,” Rosengren said. “So I think the committee probably is going to want to be pretty neutral on what they do after September.”"
WaPo_104,My in-laws don’t seem to care that I’m pregnant. Hax readers give advice.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/31/carolyn-hax-in-lawspregnant-care/,2024-08-01 02:59:02.984399,,"We asked readers to channel their inner Carolyn Hax and answer this question. Some of the best responses are below.Dear Carolyn: My husband and I are expecting our first baby on Jan. 20. We’re elated. This will be the first grandchild in both our families. When we told our parents and siblings, everyone seemed excited and congratulated us. My parents have been checking in on how I’m feeling.But my in-laws have been radio silent. They don’t call or check in any more than they did before. They ask how I’m feeling when they see me, but that’s kind of it. I was a little hurt, but I assumed they would engage more as the pregnancy progresses. A few days ago, they sent out a group email about the annual New Year’s ski trip. I’m very hurt that they plan to go ahead with a trip that is so close to my due date. Obviously, they just plan on excluding us this year.I sent my mother-in-law a private email expressing my disappointment. I suggested that maybe we could change the trip this year to a lower-impact date in the fall. I pointed out that the trip is very close to my due date and maybe it would be better for her and my father-in-law to stay closer to home in case something happens or we need help. Instead of answering me, she called my husband and said they don’t want to cancel or change the trip, but she would be happy to do a weekend trip in the fall for a smaller group.My husband is annoyed I sent the email without telling him. I feel like things have gone off the rails already, and I want to get back on track. I’ve always had a good relationship with my in-laws, and I want to keep it that way, but I’m having a very hard time getting past their disregard for my feelings. I’m looking for a way to maintain a good relationship with them but also take care of myself.— NeglectedNeglected: Congratulations! My husband and I are also due in January with our first child. I understand that it’s a very exciting and life-changing event. And yes, my husband and I have spent a lot of time talking about the baby. I can see how it’s easy to become immersed in All Things Baby. It sounds like your in-laws are excited for you, too!But, here’s the deal: We can’t expect the world to stop for other people. It sounds like you’re expecting several people to rearrange their schedules and reschedule an annual trip. I don’t think that’s reasonable. While I’m sure your in-laws are excited about the baby, they have other things going on in their lives, too.If it’s any consolation, your in-laws are gone around New Year’s and it’s unlikely your baby will arrive that early. They’ll probably be back well before you deliver. So, let them have their annual ski trip, rest up and enjoy your last few weeks of your quiet home before your little one arrives!— Another January 2025 MomNeglected: Oh the blessing of noninvasive in-laws! The freedom! I’ve started off with a similar in-laws fantasy, but my real-life version of that fantasy are bored, bossy and meddling in-laws. Would you rather that? My first marriage might have survived if it weren’t for his mother.Tall fences make good neighbors, and in-laws focused on living their own lives make great in-laws. Congratulations on your pregnancy and hope you are feeling well!— AnnNeglected: In a way, I agree with your husband. Not because you have to check with him before reaching out to his family, but, because it’s his side of the family that’s affecting you. The two of you should be able to talk it over together. After all, you don’t say why he was annoyed you didn’t tell him. Was it because he doesn’t like inter-family drama?  Would he have preferred to be the messenger for something the two of you were bringing up together? Does he share how you feel about their response and the merits of continuing an annual trip? Any of those feel entirely plausible to me.So, I would start with the person closest to you — him. Whether he is on your side or not, and I hope he is, the two of you should be able to understand and advocate for each other. Tell him how this is making you feel and why you reached out to them, then go from there, openly and compassionately. I don’t know if your in-laws are the kind of people who can provide the support you’re asking for. But he’s the man you’ll raise a child with, and the two of you must be able to be open with each other.— SidesNeglected: All three of our adult children have kids. The grandparents-to-be have to maintain the relationships with all family members while making room for the new grandchild in their lives. Imagine how slighted the rest of the family may feel if they had to give up a cherished annual ski vacation just because you “might” go into labor. They will be back from skiing within a couple of days, so wish them plenty of snow and easy travels. We are skiers, too, but now we get to ski with our kids and grandchildren, as we have kept the ski week tradition alive.— IceyriderNeglected: You say this is a first grandchild on all sides, so this isn’t one of those situations where the grandparents dote more on some grandkids than others. It’s very likely your in-laws haven’t processed things at the same rate as your family, or they are simply more reserved, hands-off in their relationships overall. Give them the opportunity to be involved; don’t push when they don’t want that, and maybe they’ll come around once the baby’s here.Or, like my mother-in-law, they may be the kind of grandparents who don’t bond with babies but find engagement with older kids enormously fulfilling. My parents and my mother-in-law could not have been more different in what they wanted or needed in their grandparental roles, and everyone was happiest when we gave them each what they wanted, within our own boundaries. No more and no less.— WaitEvery week, we ask readers to answer a question submitted to Carolyn Hax’s live chat or email. Read last week’s installment here.

WaPo_105,"Robin Warren, pathologist who rewrote the science on ulcers, dies at 87",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/31/robin-warren-nobel-ulcers-dies/,2024-08-01 02:46:02.984399,,"Robin Warren, an Australian pathologist who shared a Nobel Prize for rewriting medical views on gut health with research that included his partner drinking a bacteria-laced brew to show how microbes can cause ulcers, died July 23 in Perth, Australia. He was 87.The death was announced by the University of Western Australia, where Dr. Warren was a professor emeritus. The statement gave no other details.The discoveries by Dr. Warren and Barry Marshall at Royal Perth Hospital completely upended long-standing medical assumptions that the stomach’s gastric fluids would kill any invasive bacteria. Yet, for more than a decade, the two researchers confronted a medical community slow to accept their theories and acknowledge their findings.As Marshall once put it, “To gastroenterologists, the concept of a germ causing ulcers was like saying that the Earth is flat.”For patients, there are now antibiotic treatments for peptic ulcers — once considered a chronic condition — as well as a noninvasive breath test to diagnose ulcers and avoid possible biopsies. In wider medical research, the work by Dr. Warren and Marshall also introduced theories about possible bacterial factors in ailments caused by inflammation, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and as potential triggers for cancers.Until the studies by Dr. Warren and Marshall, the medical consensus was that ulcers and other gastric troubles were often attributed to stress or lifestyle choices such as eating spicy foods or drinking alcohol.“With tenacity and a prepared mind [they] challenged prevailing dogmas,” said a statement from the Nobel committee when Dr. Warren and Marshall received the prize for medicine in 2005.The journey began with a glance in 1979 at a biopsy sample at the Royal Perth Hospital, where Dr. Warren was a chief pathologist. He noticed bacteria on tissue from a patient with ulcers. Dr. Warren had long mulled over an alternative “germ theory” for ulcers, but he had scant evidence to bolster his ideas and almost no supporters.“Bacteria had been seen before, but these findings had been disregarded as some odd curiosities or just contaminations,” said Swedish microbiologist Staffan Normark at the Nobel Prize announcement in Stockholm.Marshall, as a young clinical researcher, watched the eyerolls at Dr. Warren during medical conferences. “He would mention these bacteria and the surgeons would be saying ‘ha ha ha, Robin’s talking about his bacteria again,’” recalled Marshall in an interview with the Medical Republic, an Australian health and science site.The biopsy sample spotted by Dr. Warren gave him a tangible lead. He recruited Marshall, and they began studying tissue from patients with ulcers and other digestive problems. Nearly all the samples showed the presence of the same bacteria. They dubbed it Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori: “helico,” as in helicopter, for its spiral shape, and “pylori” for the pylorus valve at the bottom of the stomach.They announced their findings in a series of papers, including in the British journal the Lancet, in the early 1980s. The medical community remained skeptical.“For about 100 years, or 1,000 years, the standard teaching in medicine was that the stomach was sterile and nothing grew there because of corrosive gastric juices,” Dr. Warren said. “So everybody believed there were no bacteria in the stomach. When I said they were there, no one believed it.”In July 1984, Marshall turned himself into a lab subject. He swilled down a bacterial broth in an attempt to draw conclusive links between H. pylori and ulcers. Test animals such as pigs and rats were immune to the bacteria. Dr. Warren already had an H. pylori infection, and they feared he could have built an immunity.“So, Barry, I think it has to be you,” Marshall recalled Dr. Warren telling him.After about three days, Marshall became sick. “I started vomiting. I was waking up in the middle of the night, I couldn’t eat well, I was having night sweats,” he told the Australian, a newspaper based near Sydney, in 2005. “I had the endoscopy after a week and it showed the bacteria had taken hold.”The test revealed H. pylori around an inflamed part of his stomach. He was better after a course of antibiotics, further advancing their findings toward a cure.About two-thirds of the world population has been infected with H. pylori, often during childhood, but the bacteria leads to health problems in a relatively small number of people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections can also bring an increased risk of gastric cancers or a lymphoma known as mucosal associated-lymphoid-type, or MALT, the CDC says.The precise reason H. pylori becomes aggressive in some people is not fully understood. But when it happens, the bacteria can cause ulcers by damaging the stomach lining and making it more vulnerable to digestive fluids. H. pylori causes more than 90 percent of duodenal stomach ulcers and 80 percent of upper-intestinal ulcers, the Nobel committee said. Other causes are overuse of some drugs that can compromise the stomach lining.“The idea of stress and things like that was just so entrenched nobody could really believe that it was bacteria,” Dr. Warren once said. “It had to come from some weird place like Perth, Western Australia, because I think nobody else would have even considered it.”John Robin Warren was born on June 11, 1937, in Adelaide, Australia. His father was a winemaker. His mother was a nurse.“I cannot remember my mother ever pressuring me to study medicine, but somehow this always seemed to be my aim,” Dr. Warren wrote in his biographical essay for the Nobel committee.Months after receiving a university scholarship to study medicine, he had his first grand mal seizure and was diagnosed with epilepsy. He was prescribed drugs that helped control the seizures, but he could not receive a driver’s license and used his bicycle for appointments and classes. His family had discussions — without Robin’s knowledge — about whether to demand that he pass up medical school because of his condition.“It was only years later that I came to appreciate just how much my mother had gone through to support my independence. … Apparently, mother was worried sick, but she never said a word about it,” he wrote.After receiving a degree in medicine from the University of Adelaide in 1961, he trained in clinical pathology at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Dr. Warren sought a position in Papua New Guinea, then under Australian control, in hopes of studying more “exotic and usual diseases.”Instead, he was recruited by the Royal Perth Hospital in 1968 as a staff specialist in pathology, which included an affiliation with the University of Western Australia. He retired from the hospital in 1999 and was named a professor emeritus at the university in 2005.In 2007, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, the country’s highest civilian honor.During the early 1980s, Dr. Warren said, he and Marshall felt almost like outcasts with their bacteria research. “Otherwise,” Dr. Warren said, “it seemed that only our wives stood beside us.”He married the former Winifred Theresa Williams in 1962, and they had five children. She died in 1997. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.In an interview with the Australian Academy of Science, Dr. Warren said that pathologists often encounter oddities in research. The challenge, he noted, is to decide which enigma holds a mystery worth cracking.“When you look down the microscope at pieces of tissue … it’s not unusual to find something unexpected, because there are so many unusual things,” he said. “And if there are 10,000 unusual things, you find one of them every now and again.”"
WaPo_106,"Four years later, IG report says Barr did not order Lafayette Square cleared",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/31/trump-barr-lafayette-park-justice-protests/,2024-08-01 02:39:02.984399,,"An internal Justice Department probe has found that Trump administration Attorney General William P. Barr did not personally order protesters cleared from the park near the White House during the 2020 racial justice protests — despite the agency’s claim at the time that he did.The Inspector General report released Wednesday, more than four years after the protests, concluded that the police response was hampered by miscommunication, poor leadership, and unprepared law enforcement officers.After the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, protesters gathered in large numbers at Lafayette Square in front of the White House each night between May 29 and June 6. Many law enforcement agencies under the Justice Department’s purview — including the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals Service — sent officers to help patrol the protests. Inspector General Michael Horowitz said he commissioned the report to examine how the Justice Department responded to the unrest.The report delves most deeply into the controversial events of June 1, 2020. That’s the evening when law enforcement personnel forcibly cleared thousands of people from the square using pepper balls, tear gas and nonlethal grenades, which release rubber pellets, light, sound and sometimes tear gas.One of the lingering questions has been whether Barr or other Trump administration officials abused their power and ordered law enforcement officers to remove protesters. While the crowd was overwhelmingly peaceful, Trump and his allies had fixated on other demonstrations that had sporadically turned violent in the days since Floyd’s killing, including in the nation’s capital.The report lays out the timeline and conversations surrounding the clearing of the square.Shortly before the protesters were removed, Barr was in front of the White House — visible to the demonstrators — and spoke with a U.S. Park Police captain about when the area would be cleared, according to the report.At 6:23 p.m., about 10 minutes after Barr spoke to the captain, officers announced that the protesters needed to leave. The clearing was completed by 6:50, the report said.Ten minutes later, Barr accompanied then-President Donald Trump through the emptied square and across the street to take pictures in front of St. John’s Church, where protesters had ignited a fire through a basement window the night before.The next day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec issued a statement saying the attorney general personally directed law enforcement to “get it done” and remove the protesters.But the inspector general report concluded that Barr did not actually issue that directive. According to the report, when Barr spoke to the Park Police captain, he was asking about when the protesters would be cleared. The report did not find any evidence that Barr said or did anything to speed up that timing. Instead, it said the U.S. Park Police and U.S. Secret Service, which are not controlled by the Justice Department, made the decision to empty the square.Barr and Kupec declined to be interviewed for the report. Because of that, the inspector general said, he could not determine whether Barr signed off on Kupec’s statement that the attorney general told police to “get it done.”Barr and Kupec did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report Wednesday.“Witnesses told us they did not hear Barr make such a statement, and we therefore concluded that Kupec’s statement gave the inaccurate impression Barr had personally ordered the operation and led to significant public confusion regarding DOJ’s role in it,” the report stated.But the report found that Barr’s leadership was “chaotic and disorganized.” His involvement in deployment decisions usually made by people working within specific law enforcement agencies created confusion, Horowitz wrote, with people saying they were unsure of who was in charge. Barr’s interference led to “standard practices and procedures being set aside with detrimental effects,” according to the report.In an effort to show that law enforcement could handle the protests without military intervention, the inspector general found, Barr deployed law enforcement under the Justice Department’s purview without ample preparation or direction.For example, some Bureau of Prisons officers arrived at Lafayette Square without shields because they did not know they were going to be assisting with crowd control, the report said. The FBI — which is part of the Justice Department — sent armed agents to patrol protests around D.C., but those agents were not trained and did not have clear direction on their mission, creating safety risks for the agents and protesters, the report said.“Overall, we shared the serious concerns expressed to us by law enforcement personnel and were most troubled by the Department leadership’s decision-making in putting DOJ law enforcement agents and elite tactical units in close proximity to the public and requiring them to perform missions for which they lacked the proper equipment and training,” the report concluded.This is the third report that the Justice Department’s inspector general has released in recent weeks about events during Barr’s leadership of the agency while Trump was in office. Last week, the inspector general said Barr’s Justice Department broke with long-standing norms during the 2020 election cycle by publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation into nine military mail-in ballots tossed into a dumpster in Pennsylvania.  Another report released last week examined the softening of the sentencing recommendation for Trump confidant Roger Stone after he was convicted of lying to Congress."
WaPo_107,"He waited 34 years, then spent an extra week in prison. He’s finally free.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/31/christopher-dunn-released-missouri-supreme-court/,2024-08-01 02:10:02.984399,,"For the second week in a row, Christopher Dunn wore real underwear, the kind with an elastic band he hadn’t been able to enjoy during his three decades in prison. He donned a sage green button-up shirt and a green and blue tie, preparing yet again for his release.This time, he wouldn’t have to exchange it for a prison jumpsuit minutes before he was scheduled to be set free. Instead, he went to Michael’s Bar and Grill, a 10-minute drive away. He ate a cheeseburger, fries and a Greek salad.After 34 years of incarceration for a crime a court says he didn’t commit, and another week locked up after that court vacated his murder conviction, Dunn finally walked free Tuesday night.“St. Louis, listen, it was 34 years ago that they took me away from you. It shouldn’t have been this long,” Dunn said at a news conference after he was released. “I never gave up because my family never gave up.”His wife, Kira Dunn, said the saga was the “highest high and lowest low” she had experienced in her life.“We are feeling like we are still in a dream,” she told The Washington Post.Dunn’s release is the culmination of a fight between his lawyers and the state attorney general that has drawn national attention. The 52-year-old was set to be freed last week after the St. Louis Circuit Court overturned his conviction in a 1990 murder and ordered his release.Within hours of that court’s ruling, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) appealed to the state’s top court to keep Dunn in prison. As the Missouri Department of Corrections finalized his papers two days later, the state Supreme Court halted the release, citing Bailey’s request.The call stopping his release came as Dunn was dressed in civilian clothes, “50 feet” from the prison parking lot, Kira Dunn said. He had already thrown away his prison toothbrush.“To hear the decision of the judge and then get prepared to leave on Wednesday, only to be brought back into the prison, it was torture,” Dunn said at the news conference.On Tuesday, the high court lifted its stay, and the St. Louis prosecutor dismissed Dunn’s charges, allowing him to be set free from South Central Correctional Center in Licking, about a two-hour drive from St. Louis.His mother, Martha Dunn, and his wife embraced him outside a St. Louis courtroom.“We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,” Dunn’s legal team said in a statement. “Our joy in welcoming Chris home is tempered by the additional days and moments stolen from him by this week’s proceedings.”Earlier this month, St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Jason Sengheiser had ruled that Dunn was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. He ordered the Department of Corrections to release Dunn within two days.Sengheiser wrote that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore had proved Dunn’s “actual innocence,” after two witnesses who had identified Dunn as the killer in 1990 later recanted their testimony as adults. They said they had been coerced by police to testify.Bailey argued that the recantations themselves had been coerced and that Dunn was really guilty. Court filings showed that Bailey advised the Department of Corrections to wait to release Dunn until the appeal played out. Dunn remained incarcerated for another six days after his scheduled release.“Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn’s murder conviction,” Madeline Sieren, Bailey’s spokesperson, said in an email last week. “We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.”Sieren did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday after Dunn’s release.At a news conference Tuesday before Dunn walked free, Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. and other Black leaders had said Bailey had overstepped “his jurisdiction and authority.” They argued that Bailey’s real reasons for appealing the exoneration were politics and racism.Political scientists had noted that Bailey is facing a primary challenge to his right from Will Scharf, an attorney who has represented Donald Trump. The former president this week praised both Scharf and Bailey on social media, saying each has his “Complete and Total Endorsement.”Charles Zug, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, said Bailey may have been trying to strengthen his “law and order” bona fides to garner support.Dunn’s attorneys, including Rachel Wester and Tricia Rojo Bushnell from the Midwest Innocence Project, and Justin Bonus and Jonathan Potts from Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, said his freedom was “long overdue.”They noted that it was not the first time Bailey had appealed to keep someone behind bars after a court vacated their conviction. Earlier this month, Sandra Hemme was released after Bailey similarly appealed to a judge overturning her conviction before Missouri’s top court allowed her release.“Chris Dunn deserved better. Ricco Rogers and his family deserved better,” the attorneys said in a statement. “As a nation, we deserve better.”"
WaPo_108,Russia transfers dissident Kara-Murza and other political prisoners,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/russia-prisoners-kara-murza-swap/,2024-08-01 02:06:02.984399,,"Vladimir Kara-Murza, a longtime opposition politician and Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post Opinions contributor who is serving a 25-year sentence in Russia for treason because he criticized the war in Ukraine, was being moved from the penal colony where he was being held, prison officials said on Wednesday, to an uncertain destination.Officials from Russia’s penitentiary service told Reuters that Kara-Murza was being transferred from the colony, IK-6 in the Siberian city of Omsk, but would not say to where. Kara-Murza has been in poor health, but his lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said that the defense team could not get access to their client at an Omsk hospital for two consecutive days.Prokhorov’s statement, on Facebook, added to mounting speculation by lawyers, prisoners’ relatives and journalists that the United States, Germany and potentially other countries are preparing for a sweeping prisoner swap with Russia.Also this week, at least seven other political prisoners in Russia disappeared from the colonies where they were being held, including opposition figures Ilya Yashin, Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, as well as activist Oleg Orlov and artist Alexandra Skochilenko, a move that lawyers described as extremely unusual. In addition to Kara-Murza, two other prisoners were reported to have gone missing Wednesday, bringing to 10 the total number suddenly out of communication.According to Prokhorov, Kara-Murza is due to appear in court on Thursday, but it is not clear whether the hearing will be held. At the same time, he said, hospital administrators would not confirm that Kara-Murza had been moved.Plane spotters on Wednesday reported that a special government aircraft, part of the flight squadron “Russia,” which is managed by the presidential administration, visited several regions where the missing prisoners were being held before returning to Moscow, prompting speculation that some of them were moved to the capital.A lawyer for Paul Whelan, an American former Marine who was convicted of spying in 2020 and is serving a 16-year sentence in Russia, said that she is unaware of his whereabouts and cannot contact him.“There are rumors about a possible exchange,” the lawyer, Olga Karlova, told the Interfax news agency. “I sent a request to the colony administration, but they are not responding.”Karlova said she requested that the Public Monitoring Commission, a government body overseeing prisoners across Russia, visit Whelan and establish his whereabouts. Eva Merkacheva, a member of the commission, said the group did not have any information about a potential swap but did not rule it out.“Could this be a group exchange? Anything is possible,” Merkacheva wrote on her Telegram blog. “This has never happened in modern Russian history, but in Soviet history it did. Could this be a pardon? In the case of some, it could have been (as they wrote a petition to the president), but the rest did not do this.”Maria Ponomarenko, a journalist serving a six-year sentence for spreading “fakes” about the Russian military, was not brought to a scheduled court hearing on Friday, her employer, RusNews, posted on its Telegram channel.Prisoners’ relatives and friends said they are unaware of the reasons for the transfers.A lawyer for one prisoner told The Washington Post on Tuesday that the defense team did not get any heads-up about a potential swap, but “everything looks very unusual and extraordinary; something very unusual is going on.”“I don’t believe in coincidences; it looks like well-coordinated actions,” the lawyer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concern about legal repercussions for communicating with a foreign news organization.There was no confirmation from American or Russian officials that the prisoner movements were connected to an exchange. However, senior Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, have said that talks are underway for an exchange that would involve the American journalist Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, convicted in Russia this month of espionage — charges that he, his employers and the U.S. government say are baseless.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday declined to comment on the possibility of a prisoner exchange, as he did the day before when also asked about the speculation.On Tuesday, Rico Krieger, a German citizen who was sentenced to death after being convicted in Belarus of terrorism, was pardoned in a surprise move by the country’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. Some analysts suggested that Krieger could be involved in a swap as Russia is known to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, an assassin serving a life sentence in Germany.Russia also holds a 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen, Kevin Lik, who was recently sentenced to four years for treason. On Tuesday, Lik disappeared from a colony in the remote northern Arkhangelsk region."
WaPo_109,"In Paris, ageless Olympians add stature and lessons that endure",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/olympics-age-athletes-older-paris-2024/,2024-08-01 02:04:02.984399,,"PARIS — On the night before her 10th Olympics appearance, Nino Salukvadze carried the flag for Georgia during the Opening Ceremonies. It was her third time as a flag bearer. Afterward, she fell asleep during the 2½-hour drive back to Chateauroux, France, site of the shooting competition.“I have no problem with sleep,” the 55-year-old joked. “No problem.”Nine hours after returning, she made history last Saturday as the first woman to compete in 10 Olympics. She joined Canadian show jumper Ian Millar as the only 10-time Olympians.“Now, it’s gender equality,” she announced to reporters after the feat.It’s also a celebration of age equality. Salukvadze entered the record books, but at these Summer Games, she’s hardly alone in bending time. Old is a slanderous term here. There are too many enduring, transcendent legends gracing the Paris Olympics: Diana Taurasi (42), LeBron James (39), Rafael Nadal (38), Novak Djokovic (37). We’re talking about GOAT-level athletes in their disciplines, most of them still capable of glory.Even when some, such as Nadal, haven’t been able to overcome physical deterioration, it’s still a gift to see them striving on this stage for national pride. With stakes beyond their individual legacies, they seem different — more accessible and more wholesome — than their wealth and celebrity suggests.The age defiance isn’t limited to big names who play in established professional leagues. You also must go deeper than the likes of Salukvadze, who benefits from playing a sport that doesn’t punish aging as harshly as others.The Olympics, which used to have a strict amateur policy, have a reputation as a showcase for precocious talent. Gymnastics and swimming are among the signature events in which elite athletes have a long history of peaking early. Yet here is Simone Biles, at 27 and in her third Olympics, in position to became the all-around Olympic champion for a second time. In 1984, Mary Lou Retton was 16 when she became the first American woman to win the all-around gold. She retired two years later.On Tuesday night, Biles led a U.S. women’s squad with an average age of nearly 22½ years, the oldest since 1952, to the team gold. On social media Wednesday, Biles unveiled the team’s official nickname.“Golden Girls,” she declared, a nod to the classic television show.In the pool, there’s Katie Ledecky, 27, the greatest distance swimmer ever, still thriving. Twenty years ago, she would’ve been considered ancient.The Olympics, with their abundance of different sports, magnify how athletes are evolving and redefining the possibilities. In Paris, the ages of Olympians range from 11 (Chinese skateboarder Zheng Haohao) to 65 (Spanish equestrian rider Juan Antonio Jiménez). It’s a treat to anticipate the Olympic debut of 16-year-old track wunderkind Quincy Wilson, who is in the 4x400 relay pool, and watch volleyball player Jordan Larson wearing a United States uniform again at 37.Larson is playing in her fourth Olympics. She retired in 2021 after the U.S. women’s volleyball team won the gold medal at the Tokyo Games. She got married a few days later. She dreamed of starting a family. But the marriage didn’t last long. After a divorce, she felt a gradual pull toward the sport.“I had stepped away,” Larson said. “I was just walking four miles a day — full retirement plan. But life had another plan for me.”There’s nothing wrong with that plan. Larson sacrificed the perfect ending, a gold medal that her team had spent three Olympics seeking, to wear the USA jersey one more time. Athletes aren’t storytellers. They may yearn for their careers to be a well-crafted tale, but they understand there are no guarantees. They answer to competition, not fantasy.Don’t tell an athlete when it is over. Please don’t. As Taurasi made clear, she’ll come for you.“Only a woman would have 20 years of experience, and it’s an Achilles’ heel instead of something that is treasured and used as a way forward for our sport and for women,” said Taurasi, at her sixth Olympics. “So hopefully we can change that narrative.”In general, there’s far more praise of Taurasi than criticism, but her reaction to any whiff of negativity exemplifies why she has five gold medals, three WNBA titles and three college national titles.“You know, when you dedicate your whole life and whole career to something and you get the question of, ‘Why don’t you just retire?'” Taurasi said. “And it’s just so easy for a question to be brought up, in a manner where it’s not meant to be disrespectful, but if you’re the person being asked, it is a bit disrespectful.“I’m here to compete. I’m here to play at a high level. I’m here to give to my teammates and I’m here to win a gold medal. That’s it. I don’t care about the last 20 years. I’m worried about the next 20 years.”Like Taurasi, James doesn’t usually acknowledge his age unless he’s being asked in a flattering tone about his extraordinary longevity. He doesn’t jump as high as he once did. He isn’t as durable. But he’s still LeBron, with an advanced basketball mind and a sculpted body that still powers through defenders.“I’m just blown away by his effort, concentration and focus in every single drill,” U.S. Coach Steve Kerr said of the superstar.We don’t talk enough about what it takes to persist in sports. We look at athletes as either besting Father Time or being washed up. There are so many stops between the extremes, so many chances to compensate or submit to limitations out of stubbornness.“It gives you reassurance that you can still do it,” Larson said after she helped the defending gold medalists to a five-set victory over Serbia. “There’s doubt that creeps in at some point of just, can you do this at this age? We’re getting smarter in recovery modalities, learning how to manage your body.”Wisdom never deteriorates. On occasion, wisdom carries an advanced athlete beyond recognition.Consider 31-year-old swimmer Nic Fink, who won his first Olympic medal in the 100-meter breaststroke, tying British standout Adam Peaty for the silver medal. He’s a grown man, defined now as an engineer more than a swimmer, but he enjoyed the race of his life. Thirty-one might as well be 51 in swimming, even though Anthony Ervin, Dara Torres, Michael Phelps and others have altered expectations over the past two decades. But when you call Fink a 31-year-old silver medalist, it’s quite the flex. Plus, he still has a baby face.Of course, all these ageless ones must bow to Salukvadze. She has competed in every Olympics since the 1988 Seoul Games.“After my first Olympic Games, I not think about 10,” Salukvadze admitted.Asked why she remained so committed, she turned pragmatic. She won two medals in 1988, a gold and a silver. If she had captured two golds in Seoul, she said, “maybe I not continue.”As a 19-year-old, she thought she had more to achieve. In the past 36 years, she has added one more medal — a bronze in 2008 — to her total. The recipient of a quota spot this time, she finished 38th and didn’t qualify for the final of the women’s 10-meter air pistol, the first of her two events. But after 10 Olympics, she doesn’t just appreciate winning. Here’s how long she has lasted: In 2016, she and her son, Tsotne Machavariani, were the first mother-son duo to participate in the same Olympics. At 26, Machavariani wasn’t alive for his mom’s first three Olympics.“I’m proud,” she said of the longevity.It is definitely something to be treasured."

Biles didn’t tag her former teammate, but the caption sure seemed to be a reference to Skinner’s comments after this year’s U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials.A post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles)“Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn’t what it used to be,” Skinner, who won the silver medal on vault at the 2020 Tokyo Games, said in a since-deleted YouTube video. “I mean, obviously, a lot of girls just don’t work as hard. The girls just don’t have the work ethic, and it’s hard too because of SafeSport. Coaches can’t get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say, which in some ways is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics, you do have to be a little aggressive, a little intense.”(The U.S. Center for SafeSport was an independent body set up by Congress in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal to investigate misconduct across Olympic sports.)Skinner apologized in a statement a few days later and claimed that her comments had been misinterpreted, but Biles had the last word after her eighth Olympic medal made her the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history.“F AROUND AND FIND OUT,” Biles’s husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, commented on the Instagram post, a reference to the name Biles and her teammates revealed they had given themselves during a news conference after they won gold.The befitting name is spicier than some of the monikers the U.S. women’s gymnastics team has gone by at previous Olympics, including the “Magnificent Seven” (1996), “Fierce Five” (2012), “Final Five” (2016) and “Fighting Four” (2021).Aly Raisman asks Simone Biles and the team what their nickname is.""F.A.A.F.O.""F**k around and find out pic.twitter.com/RJjZ5OWcQgMcKayla Maroney, who won gold with the Americans at the 2012 Games, chimed in with a comment on Biles’s Instagram post, too, hoping to clear up any confusion about the similar name she shares with Skinner.“It doesn’t get more iconic than this,” Maroney wrote. “She f’d around n found out [for real]. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.”“put a finger down if simone biles just ended you,” Biles’s teammate Sunisa Lee, the reigning all-around champion, added.Biles offered an alternative, G-rated name for the squad on X.“okay on the real though, the official team name is golden girls (because oldest olympic team),” she wrote.To Skinner, this year’s squad might always be Team F.A.A.F.O., and the apparent feud between the former teammates may not be over.On Wednesday, Biles’s teammate, Jordan Chiles, shared a photo in an Instagram story of Skinner’s Instagram profile, which displayed the message “No posts yet” and the caption “When she blocks Simone.”“oop I’ve been blocked,” Biles wrote on X, followed by emojis that suggested she didn’t particularly care.oop I’ve been blocked 👀🫢😂"

With noticeable problems, they stumbled in the 2021 Olympic semifinals and crashed out of the 2023 World Cup in the round of 16 — the earliest exit in program history.But here they were in this Mediterranean port city, buzzing for more goals and repelling almost every insurgency en route to three consecutive victories by a 9-2 aggregate score. Two formidable foes — Germany on Sunday and Australia on Wednesday — were not much of a match following a breezy opener against Zambia.Led by Coach Emma Hayes and a blistering frontline, the U.S. team seems in a good place to contend for, if not win, a fifth gold medal (and first since 2012).Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman scored late in the first half and substitute Korbin Albert added a remarkable goal in the 77th minute before Alanna Kennedy scored in stoppage time for the Matildas (1-2-0).On Saturday at Parc des Princes in Paris, the United States will face Japan, which finished second behind world champion Spain in Group C with a 2-1-0 record.Although the Americans have dominated the series with Japan (31-1-8), most of the meetings since 2000 have been close. They have met in the World Cup final twice, with Japan winning on penalty kicks in 2011 and the United States prevailing four years later.The U.S. men will also visit Paris for a quarterfinal, Friday against Morocco.The U.S. women’s history with Australia is also one-sided, the lone defeat in more than 37 years and 35 meetings coming in a 2017 friendly. Matches in major tournaments, though, have historically been close. The Matildas, 2023 World Cup semifinalists, arrived at the Olympics without superstar striker Sam Kerr (ACL).Hayes used the same lineup in each of the first two matches, but with center back Tierna Davidson sidelined after a knee-on-knee collision against Germany on Sunday, Emily Sonnett started alongside Naomi Girma.Serious scoring opportunities were scarce for both sides most of the first half. The Americans enjoyed ample possession in the attacking end but labored the unlock the Australian defense. Three days ago, the Matildas were engaged in a free-for-all with Zambia, overcoming a 5-2 deficit to win, 6-5.Different opponent, different tactics. On Wednesday, Australia conceded possession and waited for its moments. As the half wore on, the Americans turned up the heat. Australia’s Mackenzie Arnold pushed Lindsey Horan’s close-range header off the underside of the crossbar and swatted Rodman’s sizzler.The breakthrough goal came in the 43rd minute, though it took several minutes to confirm it.Rose Lavelle served a corner kick. Australia won the header, but the ball drifted to Sophia Smith on the back side. Smith’s downward header through a mass of bodies took two bounces before dropping in front of Rodman inside the six-yard box for a quick stab into the net.Referee Francois Letexier waited on the video replay crew to rule out any issues. U.S. midfielder Sam Coffey had been in an offside position on Smith’s header, but did she interfere with the play?An apparent communication issue between Letexier and the video replay officials delayed the ruling. Letexier finally signaled the goal was good. But wait! Another delay. During this one, Letexier issued a yellow card to Australian Coach Tony Gustavsson. Letexier finally checked the monitor and allowed the goal to stand.After 10 minutes of stoppage time, the teams headed to the locker rooms.The Americans controlled the second half and expanded the lead when Albert, a 20-year-old midfielder employed by Paris Saint-Germain, smashed a 25-yard shot into the upper corner for her first international goal.Kennedy answered, and Australia pressed for a late equalizer before running out of time.Notes: The U.S. women will play England, the reigning European champion and World Cup runner-up, in a Nov. 30 friendly at Wembley Stadium, the federations announced. U.S. officials are also close to finalizing a second match in Europe. …Forward Jaedyn Shaw was unavailable for the third consecutive match because of a leg injury. … Left back Crystal Dunn left the match at halftime as part of Hayes’s plan to manage her minutes. … Washington Spirit rookie standout Croix Bethune made her Olympic debut late in the match."
WaPo_116,"From bust to believer, Clelin Ferrell is confident he can help Commanders",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/08/01/clelin-ferrell-commanders/,2024-08-01 03:45:02.811621,,"Clelin Ferrell’s body is a manuscript. He’s covered in tattoos — a collection that starts just under his neck, snakes down his torso and sketches inky sleeves on his arms and right leg.His first tattoo best embodies his career. Ferrell has his favorite Bible verse, Matthew 17:20, along his right forearm. He knows it by heart.“Truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move,” the Washington Commanders defensive end recited, “and nothing will be impossible for you.”It’s a constant reminder of the philosophy that has defined the latest stage of the 27-year-old’s NFL journey. The Raiders drafted Ferrell No. 4 overall out of Clemson in 2019; he will likely never live up to that pedigree. But a one-year stop in San Francisco helped rebuild the Richmond native’s confidence.Entering his sixth NFL season and first in Washington, he has carved out a new identity as a high-energy, rotational defensive end. So far in camp, he has been one of the team’s starters at a reshaped position.“Belief is the most important thing, especially in this league,” Ferrell said. “We all know we can play, but how much do you believe in yourself?”After the 2021 season, Ferrell figured the Raiders might decline his fifth-year option. He felt he performed well but had not produced statistically. Through that point , he had finished with more than two sacks just once — his rookie year in Oakland before the franchise moved to Las Vegas.He signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal with the 49ers, where defensive line coach Kris Kocurek has a reputation for reviving careers. Arik Armstead, Kerry Hyder Jr. and Samson Ebukam were examples of players who improved in San Francisco and parlayed their strong play into larger contracts elsewhere.Ferrell, who tied his career high in pressures and was tied for third on the 49ers in tackles for loss last season, per TruMedia, followed suit and earned a raise in Washington, where he will make $3.75 million this year.Asked about Kocurek’s secret sauce, Ferrell didn’t point to an on-field adjustment but rather the idea sketched on his arm.“Belief,” Ferrell said. “ … A lot of coaches, they know how to teach technique, they know how to teach scheme. But it’s different when a coach can instill belief in players … it’s easy to have your confidence broken.”Kocurek helped foster that belief, Ferrell said. He and assistant Darryl Tapp, now Washington’s defensive line coach, helped Ferrell rediscoverhis potential. Ferrell was also exposed to the winning culture that has powered the 49ers to four of the last five NFC championship games.“You can think you’re doing everything you can to be the best, and then you meet somebody that says, no, no, no, no, you got more in you,” he said.Ferrell never wanted to let down 49ers pass-rusher Nick Bosa because of a subpar work ethic, he explained. He earned the 2022 defensive player of the year’s respect. And he won over Tapp and Commanders General Manager Adam Peters, who brought Ferrell with them from San Francisco.Ferrell has quickly commanded respect from his new teammates, too.“I love the way he works on and off the field,” defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said. “ … His mindset is top notch. I see a lot of the same things in a lot of the top guys that I’ve ever played with.”“That boy [Clelin], he’s one of those guys, he’s high energy, high effort,” defensive tackle Daron Payne said. “He’s going to get after the quarterback.”.Ferrell has become better at harnessing his effort. It’s one of the main lessons he took from veterans: don’t confuse activity with accomplishment. Don’t just run hard at practice; focus on technique and merge intentionality with effort.Ferrell has honed his routine to make sure he’s healthy for the season. He has played at least 16 games in each of the past three seasons. He wants to earn third-down pass rush snaps with Washington to show his talents.“I feel like I haven’t even scratched the surface,” he said. “ … There’s so much more I have to give and I ain’t getting no younger.”Ferrell plans to debut a black visor in games, a mask hiding his gaze and intentions. In camp, he has worn a cropped jersey that shows off his impressive 6-foot-4, 265-pound physique.“I know that … look cool, it look fire, huh?” he said. “ … And the muscles, I know, I know, I don’t need shoulder pads. I work hard now! I work hard.”That hard work, it seems, begets belief."
WaPo_117,Bringing a dog into the U.S. just got more complicated,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/31/cdc-rabies-policy-dogs/,2024-08-01 03:45:02.811621,,"A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention policy intended to stop the spread of rabies goes into effect this week, creating requirements that could keep some pet owners from bringing dogs into the United States. As of Thursday, anyone entering the country with a dog must provide the proper travel documents and health records for their animal. The dog must also be microchipped and healthy.The regulations apply to all forms of international travel, including flying, driving and cruises. Travelers who don’t meet the requirements could be stopped from boarding their flight.Rabies kills an estimated 59,000 people a year across more than 150 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly all human rabies cases can be traced to bites from infected dogs. The United States has been free of dog rabies since 2007.“The regulations bring the United States into conformity with the practices of other countries that are rabies-free,” said Elizabeth Schuette, president and chief executive at the ARK at JFK, an import-export animal facility at the New York airport.The entry criteria is more elaborate for dogs who have spent time in destinations with a high threat of rabies (about 110 countries). However, travelers whose dogs have spent the previous six months in a country with a low or nonexistent threat of rabies must also abide by a few new rules.If you are planning an international trip with your pet, or plan to bring a foreign pup home with you, here is what you need to know under the new rule."
WaPo_118,Jury convicts man of illegally accessing Justice Ginsburg’s health records,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/31/ruth-ginsburg-health-records-trial/,2024-08-01 03:37:02.811621,,"A 34-year-old man was convicted Wednesday of illegally accessing the private medical data of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2019 but acquitted of posting the information to an online message board where conspiracists falsely claimed Democratic politicians were covering up her death.Trent J. Russell testified in his own defense near the end of a two-day trial in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, repeatedly asserting that he never viewed or posted the justice’s confidential medical information, which showed details of her cancer treatments at George Washington University Hospital.“I never looked at medical records for patients I wasn’t assigned to,” said Russell, who in court testimony portrayed himself as a longtime first responder and former Army combat medic who did a tour of duty in Afghanistan. He denied being a conspiracy theorist.After a half-day of deliberations, jurors convicted Russell of wrongfully obtaining Ginsburg’s private health information and destroying records in a federal investigation. He was found not guilty of wrongfully disclosing the information.The justice’s hospital chart first surfaced on 4chan, then spread to Twitter and YouTube, attracting immediate attention from federal investigators and prompting alarm from U.S. Supreme Court police officials, one of whom testified in the case about discreetly shepherding the justice to cancer treatments, in part to protect her privacy. She died in 2020 at age 87.The original post had been deleted by the time federal agents were investigating the data breach, witnesses testified, and when the FBI contacted 4chan to determine who posted Ginsburg’s medical chart, the website said it could no longer provide information such as the time of posting or the poster’s IP address because of the deletion.Russell had access to the hospital’s patient records because he worked as an organ transplant coordinator who would evaluate patients near death across 48 hospitals in the Washington region, he testified. He conceded on the witness stand to frequenting 4chan, and enjoying discussions there about TV, movies, video games, current events — and conspiracy theories — for two decades.FBI agents and a former hospital administrator testified that they traced the Jan. 7, 2019, search for Ginsburg’s patient chart to one of Russell’s home computers. Russell initially told federal agents in February 2019 that it was possible his cats had run across his keyboard, although he later said he was joking. He told the jury he had “no idea” how Ginsburg’s records turned up on his screen. “I feel like everyone’s made typos,” he said.The federal agents testified that his cellphone location data placed him in the area of his Arlington residence at the time his hospital credentials were being used to access Ginsburg’s medical chart from his home computer. Federal prosecutors in Virginia argued that Russell violated Ginsburg’s right to privacy under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), even though he had received regular training and reminders not to access or disclose private medical data.Ginsburg had not been referred as a potential organ donor to Russell’s employer, the Washington Regional Transplant Community, and Russell therefore had no reason to be searching for her patient chart, witnesses testified.U.S. officials said Russell falsely told investigators during the February 2019 interview that his phone had been stolen. They said he deleted data on a hard drive before turning it over to the FBI for inspection. Russell’s attorney, Charles Burnham, said that was a mischaracterization by the federal agents. Russell had only formatted the drive, which is not quite the same as deleting its data, he argued. (Formatting a hard drive entails deleting its data to improve its performance.)“You didn’t think it would be relevant that data on your hard drive was no longer on your hard drive?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Bedell asked Russell during cross-examination.The FBI nonetheless was able to recover a trove of telling evidence, witnesses testified. The screenshot posted to 4chan, showing Ginsburg’s cancer treatments between around 2014 and 2018, came with a message: “She died dec 31st.”An FBI agent who scanned Russell’s hard drive said she found indications that he had visited multiple posts on 4chan discussing the conspiracy theory that Democratic politicians were covering up Ginsburg’s death.The agent said she found an image mimicking a poster for the 1989 film “Weekend at Bernie’s,” labeled “Weekend at Ginsburg’s.” It showed Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) propping up Ginsburg from both sides, in a morbid play on how the movie characters cover up Bernie’s death so that they can use his beach house.Prosecutors said they also found 4chan posts on his hard drive delving into other antisemitic conspiracy theories, including one titled “Mossad just tried to assassinate Trump during the White House Christmas tree Lighting” and a Google search for “dirty jew.”Russell testified that he had last voted in the 2012 presidential election for President Barack Obama and that he was not prejudiced against Jewish people or any race or ethnicity.“Obviously I’m not antisemitic,” he said. “I have Jewish friends.”Of Ginsburg, he said, “I respect her service.”U.S. District Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff scheduled sentencing for Nov. 7. Russell, who now resides in Nebraska, faces a maximum sentence of 21 years in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines, though he is likely to get far less as a first-time offender."
WaPo_119,Ex-ballerina convicted of killing husband in ‘Black Swan’ trial,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/31/black-swan-verdict-ashley-benefield/,2024-08-01 03:25:02.811621,,"An ex-ballerina accused of killing her estranged husband was convicted of manslaughter by a Florida jury late Tuesday, closing out the dramatic case local reporters had dubbed the “Black Swan murder trial.”The Manatee County jury deliberated late into the night before finding Ashley Benefield guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Benefield, 32, was originally charged with second-degree murder with a firearm after fatally shooting Douglas Benefield, her 58-year-old estranged husband, in September 2020.Benefield, wearing a printed blouse and light-blue blazer, had no visible reaction as the verdict was read shortly before 11 p.m. local time. Defense attorney Neil Taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.Prosecutors argued that Benefield shot her husband as a means to get sole custody of their child, while defense lawyers said the shooting was self-defense as he menaced her.Eva Benefield, Douglas’s daughter from a previous marriage, praised the verdict in a TikTok video filmed outside the courthouse.“After four years of waiting, my dad got the justice that he deserves,” she said.The prosecution and defense generally agreed on the couple’s beginning: a chance meeting at a 2016 political event in Florida that led to a 13-day “whirlwind romance” and speedy nuptials between the former professional dancer and wealthy GOP donor, who were 24 and 54, respectively, when they met. The four-year marriage included a well-publicized failed venture to start a ballet company in South Carolina; a baby girl born during a period of estrangement; and later, accusations of domestic violence, according to court documents.The once-intense romance curdled, and prosecutors allege Benefield attempted to resolve her failed efforts to win sole custody of their child by killing Douglas. The defense described Douglas as often armed with a “ready to fire” concealed weapon and said he had previously thrown a loaded gun at her, punched her dog, and fired at the ceiling to quiet her as he used manipulation and abuse to control his much-younger wife.The deadly shooting unfolded at the Florida home where Benefield was living with her mother in September 2020. She was preparing for a move to Maryland, where Douglas would also move but live separately, according to court documents. The argument began in the evening, after Douglas came to the home while Benefield was packing their shared moving truck.Benefield’s defense unsuccessfully argued for the case to be set aside under Florida’s “stand your ground” law, claiming Benefield fired at her estranged husband in self-defense after he refused to stop advancing toward her. Douglas had been rough with Benefield throughout the evening as she was packing, shouldering, shoving and swiping her, her attorney said during the trial.Prosecutors argued Benefield showed no injuries save for an unrelated scrape, and said the bullet wounds on Douglas’s body indicate he was not turned toward her when he was struck. They also cited Benefield’s move to Florida to live with her mother during pregnancy, then giving birth without telling Douglas and trying to block him from seeing their child for the next six months.Assistant State Attorney Suzanne O’Donnell acknowledged in her closing arguments that domestic violence is a “real problem.” O’Donnell conceded that while some battered spouses are in circumstances where they must use deadly methods of self-defense, Benefield was not.“This defendant used domestic violence and allegations of it to make progress on her goal,” O’Donnell said. “And her goal was: She wanted sole custody of that child at all costs.”Ashley Benefield now awaits sentencing, where she faces a maximum of 3o years in prison."

WaPo_121,"Trump says Harris ‘became a Black person’ as NABJ event turns hostile, chaotic",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-black-voters-nabj-harris/,2024-08-01 03:04:02.811621,,"CHICAGO — Donald Trump on Wednesday berated a Black reporter who pressed him about past offensive comments and accused his opponent, Vice President Harris, of downplaying Black heritage she routinely highlights as a sit-down meant to showcase Trump’s outreach to voters of color immediately turned hostile.ABC News’ Rachel Scott began the Q&A session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago by noting — among other comments — Trump’s insults toward Black prosecutors, his repeated false claims that America’s first Black president was born in Africa and his comments that four congresswomen who are racial minorities should “go back” to the places they came from.“Why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?” Scott said.“Well first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said, calling the interview “disgraceful” and criticizing a “rude introduction.” He alleged he was invited under a “false pretense” because he had expected his opponent to be there as well and criticized the organizers for starting late.“I love the Black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country,” he said.Asked if it was acceptable for some of his supporters to derisively call Harris — a Black, Indian American woman — a “DEI hire,” Trump pressed the moderators to define the term, which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. The talk grew even more combative.Trump claimed Harris used to only promote her Indian heritage — even though, as a moderator pointed out, she was part of a historically Black sorority and embraced her Black identity in many ways.“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Later he said “she was Indian all the way” but then “became a Black person.'“I think somebody should look into that too,” he said, speaking over his questioner. He continued his frequent mispronunciations of Harris’s first name, which many have called disrespectful.The remarkable scene came as Trump and Harris were both set to court Black voters on Wednesday. Democrats hope their new candidate can re-energize their most reliable constituency and prevent the GOP from making gains.Republicans have been keen to improve their performance with Black voters and especially Black men, encouraged by polls that showed softening support for President Biden. But they could face a stiffer challenge now that Biden has bowed out of the 2024 race, paving the way for Harris — who is Black and Indian American — to lead the Democratic ticket.Trump’s itinerary on Wednesday reflects his continued hopes to chip away at Democrats’ traditional dominance with Black Americans. But it also underscored the resistance he is facing — largely due to his own public comments. His plans for a Q&A at the National Association of Black Journalists convention  immediately drew backlash from some members and that one former White House correspondent called a “slap in the face.”“False. False. False!” one attendee yelled out, as Trump falsely asserted that undocumented immigrants arriving to the U.S. are “taking votes away from all of the people in this room.”“You just lie!” one audience member said.Trump is also holding a rally Wednesday night in Harrisburg, Pa.1/5Harris, meanwhile, is expected to speak in Houston on Wednesday evening to a gathering of the sorority Sigma Gamma Rho — the latest in her extensive outreach to members of historically Black sororities and fraternities that make up the “Divine Nine.” Harris spoke to her own sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, in July and addressed another group, Zeta Phi Beta, last week.Democratic operatives say Harris’s candidacy already shows signs of motivating Black voters — whose flagging enthusiasm for Biden had left a hole in the Democratic base. One CNN survey found that Black voters who previously split 70 percent for Biden and 23 percent for Trump backed Harris by a wider margin of 78 percent to Trump’s 15 percent. Other polling shows less of a shift.Republicans are betting that a so-called “Harris Honeymoon” will fade and are pumping tens of millions into ads attacking Harris.Trump’s campaign had said that in Chicago he would discuss “the most pressing issues facing the Black community” in a conversation moderated by Harris Faulkner from Fox News, Kadia Goba from Semafor and Scott from ABC News.The former president has angered Black Americans in recent years with some racist and inflammatory comments and his promotion of false attacks. “What the hell do you have to lose?” he said when he ran in 2016, portraying Black communities as riddled with crime and poverty. Trump has also promoted a false conspiracy theory questioning the citizenship of Harris. Trump raised his political profile falsely claiming Obama was born in Africa; lamented immigration from “shithole counties”; and in 2019 told four congresswomen who are racial minorities to “go back” to the places they came from. Three of the lawmakers were born in the United States.“Black voters see Donald Trump’s lies and empty pandering for what they are – and they will hold him accountable at the polls this November,” Harris campaign Black Media Director Jasmine Harris said in a statement Wednesday.National Association of Black Journalists President Ken Lemon defended the group’s decision to invite Trump as standard. The organization asks major-party presidential candidates to speak each election year.“While we acknowledge the concerns expressed by our members, we believe it is important for us to provide our members with the opportunity to hear directly from candidates and hold them accountable,” Lemon said in a statement.NABJ said Wednesday that it is talking with Harris’s team about scheduling a virtual or in-person Q&A with Harris in September. Trump repeatedly taunted Harris on social media for not attending the convention this week, suggesting it was disrespectful.Trump’s team has made a point to hold Black outreach events, even as his rally crowds skew heavily White. In recent months Trump has campaigned at a Black church in Detroit and rallied in the South Bronx, where he touted his economic record and said his policies would protect voters of color from crime. A pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., has run some ads targeted to Black voters that hit the Biden administration on high inflation, undocumented immigration and transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports.Trump has also suggested that Black voters like him more because of his criminal cases. “I’m being indicted for you, the Black population,” Trump said this February at a gala for the Black Conservative Federation.Democrats, meanwhile, have promoted record-low Black unemployment during the Biden administration — and tried to communicate how their policies are helping Black voters who have often expressed cynicism about both parties. They have also accused Republicans of broadly trying to take the country backward.“Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights,” Harris told members of Zeta Phi Beta last week. She listed — among other concerns — “the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate” and “the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history.”Scott Clement contributed to this report."

But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel had dealt “crushing blows” to both Hezbollah — in a Beirut airstrike Tuesday that killed a senior official of that group — and to Hamas.During a news briefing at the White House, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said he could not “confirm or verify” claims by Iran and Hamas that Israel was to blame for Haniyeh’s slaying. He also declined to speculate on what effect the two men’s deaths would have on ongoing Gaza cease-fire and hostage-release talks, although he acknowledged that “these reports over the last 24 to 48 hours certainly don’t help. I’m not going to be Pollyannish about it.”The latest round of cease-fire talks, in Rome, were suspended earlier this week after Israel presented new demands. Haniyeh, as the political leader for Hamas, was the group’s chief negotiator for the release of hostages and a cease-fire and was seen as a moderating force on Hamas military leader Yehiya Sinwar.Secretary of State Antony Blinken, traveling in the Far East, said early Wednesday that the killing of Haniyeh was “something we were not aware of or involved in.” To some extent, the U.S. response has been restrained by Israel’s unwillingness to publicly confirm or deny its involvement.But the Biden administration is also acutely conscious of the possibility for escalation of the broader Middle East conflict and the likelihood that Iran will respond to what it has charged was an Israeli attack.“We’re obviously concerned about escalation,” Kirby said, although “we don’t believe that it is inevitable.”Just days ago, senior administration officials had declared concerns about escalation to be “exaggerated.”A senior Arab official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the sensitive issue, said that no Iranian response was expected at least until after Haniyeh’s funeral, which is scheduled for Friday in Doha, and the three days of mourning that will run through Sunday.“You’ve seen the comments” by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Kirby said. Khamenei said in a statement reported Wednesday by state-run media that Israel had “paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it.” “I’ll certainly not speculate about whether and to what degree Iran does anything. What I can tell you is we have and will maintain a level of readiness to preserve our national security interest in the region,” Kirby said.“We don’t want to see an escalation, and everything we’ve been doing since the 7th of October,” when the Gaza war began with Hamas’s invasion of Israel, “we’ve been trying to manage those risks,” he said. “Those risks go up and down every day. They are certainly up right now.”"

The fund’s target was lowered to $2 billion this week, and a key investor recently backed out.In a statement, Ackman conceded that he faced questions about whether this was the right way forward while on a roadshow to whip up excitement for the IPO.“One principal question has remained: Would investors be better served waiting to invest in the aftermarket than in the IPO?” Ackman said in a statement Wednesday, referring to the market for stock and bonds after they are originally issued.For now, the fund’s IPO will be put on ice, despite “enormous investor interest,” Ackman said. “We will report back once we are ready to launch a revised transaction.”Ackman made a name for himself on Wall Street as an activist investor, taking significant positions in companies and then overseeing lucrative turnarounds, including with fast food giant Wendy’s, mall operator General Growth Properties and rail operator Canadian Pacific.With Pershing Square USA, Ackman was looking to leverage the influence he wields on social media to build a publicly traded fund for everyday investors. He made his way into the limelight in recent months as an outspoken critic of DEI efforts in schools and corporate America, helping to lead the campaign to oust Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president.A former Democratic donor, Ackman endorsed Donald Trump for president this month.I am going to formally endorse @realDonaldTrump. I came to this decision some time ago as many @X followers have already understood from my supportive posts of Trump and my criticisms of @POTUS Biden. The reason why I have not yet formally done so is that I want to explain my…“I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible,” Ackman said in his post to more than a million followers on X announcing the endorsement.Pershing Square USA is set to be Ackman’s first new investment vehicle in 10 years. It was underwritten by Citigroup Global Markets, UBS Securities and BofA Securities, according to a prospectus filed with Securities and Exchange Commission.In a note to investors in his management company last week, Ackman acknowledged that his outsize presence at Pershing Square Capital Management was among investor concerns for the fund, Barron’s reported.

WaPo_128,Lebanon mourns victims of Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah commander,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/hezbollah-beirut-israel-strike-funerals/,2024-08-01 04:19:02.682843,,"HARET HREIK, Lebanon — Hezbollah on Wednesday confirmed the killing of one of its senior commanders in an Israeli airstrike a day earlier, calling it a “major crime” without saying how it would respond, as Lebanon and the wider region waited on edge.The confirmation of the death of the commander, Fouad Shukr, was delayed as rescue workers searched Wednesday through the rubble of a residential building in Haret Hreik, a heavily populated Beirut suburb, using excavators and drilling machines. Shukr had been on one of the bottom floors, a Hezbollah media officer explained.The Israeli military, in a statement Tuesday, called Shukr a senior military commander and held him responsible for a strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday that killed 12 children at a soccer field. Hezbollah denied carrying out that attack.The location of Tuesday’s strike — less than three miles from central Beirut — and its timing, as tensions between Israel and Hezbollah are spiking, led to fears of more escalation and worry that Lebanon would be plunged into war. Israeli officials suggested that their killing of Shukr amounted to closing a circle: their answer to the soccer field attack.But Hezbollah gave no such assurances. In its statement Wednesday, the group said leader Hasan Nasrallah would outline Hezbollah’s “political stance on this sinful attack and major crime” in a speech Thursday during Shukr’s funeral.The Israeli strike killed at least five other people, including three women and two children — Hasan Fadallah, 10, and his sister Amira, 6, their aunt said — making it one of the deadliest single strikes for civilians in Lebanon during 10 months of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. At least 80 people were injured, the Lebanese Red Cross said.In a speech this month, Nasrallah vowed to retaliate for the killings of civilians by striking new areas in Israel.During an emergency cabinet session Wednesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the Israeli strike on Shukr as well as the killing, hours later in Iran, of Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader.“We wonder at the reason behind this escalation,” Mikati said in a statement carried by Lebanon’s state news agency. “We fear the situation will worsen if the countries concerned and the entire international community do not rush to curb this dangerous disorder.”In Haret Hreik, an area where Hezbollah enjoys significant support, security was stepped up Wednesday as the rescue workers searched the detritus of the eight-story building that was hit, causing several floors to buckle. The area, which is predominantly Shiite Muslim but also has Christian residents, was rebuilt by Hezbollah, with funds from Iran, after the last major war between the group and Israel, in 2006.A few blocks away from the destroyed building Wednesday, hundreds attended a funeral for the Fadallah children, who were to be buried in a cemetery normally reserved for Hezbollah fighters.The children’s aunt, Zainab Sultani, said Israel and the United States were “responsible for what happened.” She had learned that the children were in peril from the family WhatsApp group, when her sister asked for help digging them out of the rubble. The children’s father, Mohamad, and their elder brother, Ali, were still hospitalized.When the elder brother and her own son grow up, she said, they “will join the resistance and take revenge” for the siblings.Fears of a wider war echoed in the neighborhood. Mariam Hasan, 48, an emergency room doctor at the local Sahel Hospital, said the staff was continually preparing for mass-casualty events. “Every six months we carry out training maneuvers to be prepared for natural disasters and terrorist attacks and wars,” she saidThe night of the attack on Shukr, she was headed home but turned back to the hospital once she heard the blast. “Our hospital is ready for a war,” she said, but she added that she wanted a different future. “We have enough disease, poverty and misery; we do not need wars.”Mohamad Ezzedine, a retired banker who lives next to the building where Shukr was killed, said his windows were shattered in the blast, but he had been through worse.

WaPo_131,"Trump says Harris ‘became a Black person’ as NABJ interview turns hostile, chaotic",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-black-voters-nabj-harris/,2024-08-01 04:51:02.682843,,"CHICAGO — Donald Trump on Wednesday berated a Black reporter who pressed him about past offensive comments and accused his opponent, Vice President Harris, of downplaying Black heritage she routinely highlights as a sit-down meant to showcase Trump’s outreach to voters of color immediately turned hostile.ABC News’ Rachel Scott began the Q&A session at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago by noting — among other comments — Trump’s insults toward Black prosecutors, his repeated false claims that America’s first Black president was born in Africa and his comments that four congresswomen who are racial minorities should “go back” to the places they came from.“Why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?” Scott said.“Well first of all, I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner,” Trump said, calling the interview “disgraceful” and criticizing a “rude introduction.” He alleged he was invited under a “false pretense” because he had expected his opponent to be there as well and criticized the organizers for starting late.“I love the Black population of this country, I’ve done so much for the Black population of this country,” he said.Asked if it was acceptable for some of his supporters to derisively call Harris — a Black, Indian American woman — a “DEI hire,” Trump pressed the moderators to define the term, which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. The talk grew even more combative.Trump claimed Harris used to only promote her Indian heritage — even though, as a moderator pointed out, she was part of a historically Black sorority and embraced her Black identity in many ways.“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Later he said “she was Indian all the way” but then “became a Black person.”“I think somebody should look into that too,” he said, speaking over his questioner. He continued his frequent mispronunciations of Harris’s first name, which many have called disrespectful.The remarkable scene came as Trump and Harris were both set to court Black voters on Wednesday. Democrats hope their new candidate can re-energize their most reliable constituency and prevent the GOP from making gains.Republicans have been keen to improve their performance with Black voters and especially Black men, encouraged by polls that showed softening support for President Biden. But they could face a stiffer challenge now that Biden has bowed out of the 2024 race, paving the way for Harris to lead the Democratic ticket.Trump’s itinerary on Wednesday reflects his continued hopes to chip away at Democrats’ traditional dominance with Black Americans. But it also underscored the resistance he is facing — largely due to his own public comments. His plans for a Q&A at the National Association of Black Journalists convention  immediately drew backlash from some members and that one former White House correspondent called a “slap in the face.”“False. False. False!” one attendee yelled out, as Trump falsely asserted that undocumented immigrants arriving to the U.S. are “taking votes away from all of the people in this room.”“You just lie!” one audience member said.Trump is also holding a rally Wednesday night in Harrisburg, Pa.1/5Harris, meanwhile, is expected to speak in Houston on Wednesday evening to a gathering of the sorority Sigma Gamma Rho — the latest in her extensive outreach to members of historically Black sororities and fraternities that make up the “Divine Nine.” Harris spoke to her own sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, in July and addressed another group, Zeta Phi Beta, last week.Democratic operatives say Harris’s candidacy already shows signs of motivating Black voters — whose flagging enthusiasm for Biden had left a hole in the Democratic base. One CNN survey found that Black voters who previously split 70 percent for Biden and 23 percent for Trump backed Harris by a wider margin of 78 percent to Trump’s 15 percent. Other polling shows less of a shift.Republicans are betting that a so-called “Harris Honeymoon” will fade and are pumping tens of millions into ads attacking Harris.Trump’s campaign had said that in Chicago he would discuss “the most pressing issues facing the Black community” in a conversation moderated by Harris Faulkner from Fox News, Kadia Goba from Semafor and Scott from ABC News.The former president has angered Black Americans in recent years with some racist and inflammatory comments and his promotion of false attacks. “What the hell do you have to lose?” he said when he ran in 2016, portraying Black communities as riddled with crime and poverty. Trump has also promoted a false conspiracy theory questioning the citizenship of Harris. Trump raised his political profile falsely claiming Obama was born in Africa; lamented immigration from “shithole counties”; and in 2019 told four congresswomen who are racial minorities to “go back” to the places they came from. Three of the lawmakers were born in the United States.“Black voters see Donald Trump’s lies and empty pandering for what they are – and they will hold him accountable at the polls this November,” Harris campaign Black Media Director Jasmine Harris said in a statement Wednesday.National Association of Black Journalists President Ken Lemon defended the group’s decision to invite Trump as standard. The organization asks major-party presidential candidates to speak each election year.“While we acknowledge the concerns expressed by our members, we believe it is important for us to provide our members with the opportunity to hear directly from candidates and hold them accountable,” Lemon said in a statement.NABJ said Wednesday that it is talking with Harris’s team about scheduling a virtual or in-person Q&A with Harris in September. Trump repeatedly taunted Harris on social media for not attending the convention this week, suggesting it was disrespectful.Trump’s team has made a point to hold Black outreach events, even as his rally crowds skew heavily White. In recent months Trump has campaigned at a Black church in Detroit and rallied in the South Bronx, where he touted his economic record and said his policies would protect voters of color from crime. A pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., has run some ads targeted to Black voters that hit the Biden administration on high inflation, undocumented immigration and transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports.Trump has also suggested that Black voters like him more because of his criminal cases. “I’m being indicted for you, the Black population,” Trump said this February at a gala for the Black Conservative Federation.Democrats, meanwhile, have promoted record-low Black unemployment during the Biden administration — and tried to communicate how their policies are helping Black voters who have often expressed cynicism about both parties. They have also accused Republicans of broadly trying to take the country backward.“Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights,” Harris told members of Zeta Phi Beta last week. She listed — among other concerns — “the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate” and “the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history.”Scott Clement contributed to this report."

WaPo_134,How the Murdoch family ended up in a legal fight over the future of Fox,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/31/rupert-murdoch-secret-legal-battle-children-fox-news-conservative/,2024-08-01 05:37:02.817066,,"As James Murdoch stepped away from the family business, he made clear that he didn't approve of the direction he saw it taking.Leaving his executive role and later his board seat, the younger son of conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch issued statements criticizing coverage at Fox News and other Murdoch properties — specifically decrying the “ongoing denial” of climate science by their Australian newspapers during a season of massive wildfires. He quickly reinvented himself as a center-left benefactor, donating to environmental and democracy-supporting causes.But even in unofficial exile, James remained a lurking potential threat to his father’s plans to tie the company’s future to eldest son and ideological soul mate Lachlan, the chair of News Corp and executive chair and chief executive of Fox Corporation.Now, their effort to guarantee that James’s more liberal politics do not interfere with the rightward market position of company jewel Fox News has blown up into a larger Murdoch family feud.The revelation of a secret legal battle pitting James and his two older sisters against their father and brother in a Nevada probate court, first reported by the New York Times, has raised widespread speculation about what the siblings would do with greater leverage over the company. Would they try to push Fox News and their other media enterprises closer to the center?But people close to James say that he and his sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, are mostly concerned with challenging what they see as a power move by their brother and father.“It has forced them to take a position that they didn’t really want to take,” said Paddy Manning, a biographer of Lachlan Murdoch.The feud is due to go to trial in September in Nevada, after attempts at previously unreported settlement discussions went off the rails, according to two people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about sensitive family matters.Similar discussions fell through years ago, when Lachlan made an attempt to buy out his brother and sisters.Now 93, Rupert Murdoch launched his business with a newspaper in Australia and has now built a global juggernaut that has influenced politics and culture on three continents — encompassing Fox as well as the Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Britain’s Sun tabloid, and an array of television stations and other properties.Yet in some ways, the dispute relates to the same questions and tensions surrounding any family business:Who takes over? How much can the founder rule from the grave? And perhaps most important: How do multiple heirs agree on what to do with their legacy?“A lot of the very difficult drama in family-controlled enterprises is within a generation — laterally, across siblings,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.Though Murdoch has long expressed that he wants one of his children to succeed him, it was never a foregone conclusion that it would be his eldest son.Lachlan, now 52, actually left the family business for nearly a decade after he felt undercut in a 2005 corporate dispute with some of his father’s more seasoned executives. In the interim, James Murdoch, now 51, rose through the ranks to become chief executive of the family’s European and Asian operations, often seeking to expand the company. But his ambitions took a hit when a phone-hacking scandal implicating the family’s London tabloids kept them from acquiring Britain’s largest pay-TV provider.Eventually, Rupert gave roles atop the company to both sons — James as CEO and Lachlan as his co-executive chairman — in 2015. When he realized the brothers were increasingly at odds, he resolved this by selling 21st Century Fox to Disney — leaving no role for James, setting in motion his eventual departure.But although he officially left the company, James has equal voting rights as Lachlan over the Murdoch family trust that controls the business — as do their sisters: Elisabeth, 55, who briefly worked for the company, and Prudence, 65, who never did.The sole Murdoch child who still works in the family business, Lachlan was also the only one of the four oldest children to attend their father’s wedding to his fifth wife, retired molecular biologist Elena Zhukova, in June. (Murdoch also has two daughters in their early 20s from third wife Wendi Deng, who have equal financial stakes in the trust but no voting rights.)And he is the one who most closely shares his father’s conservative politics.According to three people familiar with the family dispute, Rupert Murdoch is attempting to change the structure of the trust — making the argument in sealed court records that the only way to preserve the company’s value for his heirs is if Lachlan becomes its sole overseer.One of these people told The Washington Post that the billionaire has explicitly stated in court filings that maintaining the company’s conservative stance is essential.His worry, according to all three, was that, once he dies, the three other grown children could align to outvote their brother.The Times cited a sealed court document it had obtained, describing Rupert Murdoch’s concern that a “lack of consensus” among the siblings “would impact the strategic direction at both companies including a potential reorientation of editorial policy and content.”Last month, the Nevada probate commissioner said that, if Rupert Murdoch were able to show that he is acting for the sole benefit of his heirs, he could amend the trust, according to two of the people familiar with the family discussion.But changing the trust language is a highly emotional issue for the Murdoch children, these people said — though it would affect only voting rights and not their financial stakes — which has prompted their vigorous pushback in court.When her father told Elisabeth Murdoch about his plans to adjust the trust, she responded in colorful language to express her displeasure, according to a person familiar with the exchange, which was first reported by the Times.“There was never a conspiracy to overthrow Lachlan,” said one of the people close to the Murdoch family. “But [Lachlan and Rupert], by filing the lawsuit, have created what they were afraid of.”A spokesperson for Elisabeth Murdoch, who runs a London-based production firm, declined to comment.She does not share her brother Lachlan’s conservative politics, two people who have spoken with her in recent months said — but she also had little interest in re-engaging with the family business.She finds the politics of some of the Murdoch properties “obscene,” one of them said, “but she’s managed to draw a line and disassociate herself from it.”“Liz had been trying to get Rupert to focus on his legacy,” said Manning, the biographer. He added that she had been trying to “be the peacemaker” and “to build bridges between the siblings, and now this.”Less is publicly known about the political leanings of Prudence, who tends to remain in the background of family disagreements but is close to her sister.James, while espousing environmental causes, has also raised concerns about the role of conservative media in promoting false claims of voting fraud in the 2020 election.“The sacking of the Capitol is proof positive that what we thought was dangerous is indeed very, very much so,” he said in a 2021 interview. Without naming Fox News — which has faced major defamation suits from voting-technology companies, and last year paid $787.5 million to settle one — he added that “those outlets that propagate lies to their audience have unleashed insidious and uncontrollable forces that will be with us for years.”A spokesperson for James Murdoch declined to comment.But it’s unclear whether the siblings are particularly motivated by politics in their challenge to their father and brother.People close to James note that he was running the Murdoch business in Europe when it threw its weight behind Tory candidate David Cameron over Labour’s Gordon Brown. Today, he and his wife, Kathryn, are major funders of the Bulwark, a conservative anti-Donald Trump publication.Meanwhile, he has told associates in recent years that he was disappointed by the strategic decisions his brother has overseen at Fox Corp and News Corp.And media experts say that any effort to move Fox News, in particular, toward a center-right positioning could ultimately shrink the audience and hurt the company’s bottom line.Fox News experienced such an audience revolt when its political analysts correctly called the state of Arizona for Joe Biden on election night in 2020 and some viewers temporarily ditched it for channels they viewed as being more aligned with Trump. Emails and text communications revealed as a part of one of the defamation lawsuits showed that top executives — including Rupert Murdoch — noted the trend with alarm.“At a certain point, you become afraid of doing anything that will offend your audience,” said Charlie Sykes, a former conservative radio host who is now a contributor to the liberal-leaning cable news network MSNBC. “If you deviate from what the audience wants, there is this massive blowback, and there will be consequences. And if the audience demands that Fox News become a MAGA safe space, then there’s going to be tremendous pressure.”Columbia University journalism professor Bill Grueskin, who served as deputy managing editor for the Murdoch-controlled Wall Street Journal, said he could see a path forward for Fox that reemphasizes news from a conservative point of view.“It does strike me that there’s a way for there to be a conservative news channel that doesn’t slide into the fever swamps that have already cost Fox $787.5 million in claims,” he said.But, he added, “it’s all up to who is running the company. It sounds like, if it’s Lachlan, things won’t change very much, but if it’s James, things would change a lot.”"
WaPo_135,"For Frederick Richard, disappointment drives determination for L.A. Olympics",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/frederick-richard-mens-gymnastics-all-around-paris-olympics/,2024-08-01 05:35:02.817066,,"PARIS — This is exactly where Frederick Richard wants to be: inside a packed arena competing alongside the world’s best gymnasts on his sport’s biggest stage. He doesn’t shy away from the spotlight. He relishes it, yearning for the world to believe in his potential as much as he does. But soon after he stepped onto the floor dreaming of an Olympic all-around medal, he stumbled into a position that left him dissatisfied.Richard landed in 15th place, a disappointing result after he won the all-around bronze at last fall’s world championships. That proved a podium finish was within reach. But Richard’s performance in Wednesday’s all-around final at the Paris Olympics unraveled nearly as soon as it started. A fall on pommel horse in the opening rotation sent him tumbling toward the bottom of the standings and abruptly dashed his medal hopes.“Fifteenth place means nothing to me,” Richard said. “Yes, it’s amazing we’re at the biggest competition, but I know I have way more in me. The world knows I have way more in me.”Richard, a 20-year-old brimming with confidence, doesn’t hide his ambition. He said before this trip to Paris that he wanted to “be the greatest of all time in gymnastics” — not just in the United States but “in the world, of course.” Much of his career lies ahead. This Olympic cycle, he believes, was just the start.Richard helped lead the Americans to a breakthrough bronze medal in the team final, a performance that garnered attention in the United States that’s rare for men’s gymnastics, and then this all-around final became an individual measuring stick. Richard, who said he felt fatigued, fell twice and finished with a 82.166, more than four points shy of gold medalist Shinnosuke Oka of Japan. Even without the deductions for his falls, Richard’s score would have been just the ninth-best.Richard has ascended to the top of the sport within his country, but against the rest of the world, a gulf remains. The top six athletes from qualifying rotated together in the final. Richard worked through the apparatuses with the second-tier group of gymnasts, separated from most of the serious contenders by a symbolic distance.The U.S. men’s gymnastics team believes it has progressed, but its gymnasts still cannot rival those from Japan and China. Oka clinched Japan’s fourth straight Olympic all-around gold, following in the path of all-time great Kohei Uchimura, who won in 2012 and 2016, and Daiki Hashimoto, the champion in Tokyo. Hashimoto, who also won the all-around titles at the past two world championships, fell off the pommel horse and could claw back to just sixth place.China’s Zhang Boheng overcame a fall on floor in the first rotation to win the silver with a 86.599, and Xiao Ruoteng, also from China, claimed bronze.“When I’m really on that day, there’s not that much of a gap,” Richard said. “But when I’m not on, there’s a big gap.”Richard wants to be able to do what those top gymnasts did: Win a medal with an average performance. He doesn’t want his medal hopes to require near-perfection. When he watches the Chinese and Japanese athletes, he admires their technique and fundamentals, and Richard knows the more he masters his skills, the less he’ll risk running out of energy when he has to perform just a couple of days after an emotional outing.In Wednesday’s final rotation, the medal contenders delivered. Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun, with symbols of his home country tattooed on his arm, made a strong push with a fantastic floor routine. Zhang, the last athlete to compete on high bar, hit his set and slid into second place, pushing Kovtun into fourth. All four gymnasts finished with scores within 0.667 points of one another.After the early error, Richard was never in contention. In his final performance at these Games, he put his hands down on his last tumbling pass. He had contributed on four apparatuses in the team final two days earlier, and on each of those events, he posted a lower mark in the all-around final.“I gave everything in the team final,” Richard said. “Very worth it getting the medal. But I didn’t bounce back the way I thought I would or wanted to.”Brody Malone was expected to join Richard in the all-around final, but Malone, the reigning U.S. all-around champion, had a disastrous performance in the qualifying round. He had finished fourth at world championships in 2022, then worked back from a serious knee injury last year. But his poor performance to start his second Olympics meant he wouldn’t compete for any individual medals. Instead, Paul Juda advanced, and during the final, Malone was on the floor in a T-shirt in a supporting role.Juda, a teammate of Richard’s at the University of Michigan, hit all of his routines at these Games. His skills aren’t as difficult, so he has a lower scoring ceiling, but he managed to finish just ahead of Richard in 14th place. Entering the Olympic trials, his spot on this team didn’t feel certain. And entering these Games, a spot in the all-around final seemed unlikely. Once he advanced, he said he knew “lightning had to strike in the same place like four times for me to medal today.”So Juda was thrilled with his result. After his final routine here, he kissed the pommel horse. When asked to describe the experience, he rated it a 12 out of 10.Richard wants more. He doesn’t look for the silver linings of his performance today. He instead feels more hunger. He’s already thinking about what he can do with four years to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games, when he’ll be 24 years old and in what he views as his peak physical shape.“It’s lock-in time again,” Richard said. “Let’s do everything it takes because the goal is not just to get on the podium. The goal is to win. The goal is to win by big gaps like the women did. … We’re just getting started. And now I have time. Time is a big advantage.”When asked where he wants to be on this day in four years, Richard immediately answered: First place.“I don’t think I’m going to let anything else happen,” he said."

That now extends to kicker, too.Washington claimed Riley Patterson off waivers from Jacksonville on Wednesday, giving another kicker on the 90-man camp roster alongside Ramiz Ahmed.Patterson, 24, signed with the Minnesota Vikings after going undrafted out of Memphis in 2021 and was later signed to the New England Patriots’ practice squad. The Detroit Lions acquired him midway through the 2021 season, and Patterson made his NFL debut against the Chicago Bears, booting two extra points in a narrow loss. In Week 15, Patterson converted three field goals and three extra points in a win over the Arizona Cardinals to earn NFC special teams player of the week.Patterson made all 16 extra-point attempts in his rookie season missed only one of 14 field goal attempts, from 55 yards.He was claimed by Jacksonville in 2022 and played in all 17 games, earning AFC special teams player of the week honors (four field goals, one extra point) in a win over the New York Jets. He later kicked the game-winning field goal in the wild card round of the playoffs against the Los Angeles Chargers. It was the third-largest comeback victory in playoff history.Patterson was, coincidentally, replaced in Jacksonville by Brandon McManus, whom Washington signed in March and released three months later after he was accused of sexual assault during his time with the Jaguars.Patterson spent last season in Detroit and then Cleveland, and he was released by the Jaguars this week after signing a reserve/future contract in February.Washington signed Ahmed in June, but with the possibility of bringing on another kicker to create competition for the job. Ahmed appeared solid early in training camp but has struggled with field goals from 50 yards and beyond.“Yeah, I think maybe almost half the league have two into that space,” Quinn said last week. “But that and other positions are still part of the competition.""The Commanders also re-signed 30-year-old wide receiver Byron Pringle on Wednesday and cut receivers Dax Milne, a 2021 seventh-round pick, and Damiere Byrd.Pringle joined the Commanders in the summer of 2023 and played in all 17 games, catching 14 of 22 targets for 161 yards (11.5 yards per reception).The 30-year-old adds to a position group with at least a couple roster spots up for grabs behind Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson and third-round rookie Luke McCaffrey."
WaPo_137,Maryland enters preseason camp hoping a starting quarterback will emerge,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/maryland-football-quarterbacks/,2024-08-01 05:17:02.817066,,"Maryland safety Dante Trader Jr. had arrived at the on-campus football facility Wednesday morning for the start of preseason camp when the senior noticed the quarterbacks entering together purposefully, eschewing conversation with headphones snug to their ears.The laser focus among the players in that crowded room delivered an unspoken message to the rest of the team as the Terrapins coaching staff continues to construct the offense following the departure of record-setting four-year starter Taulia Tagovailoa.“They’re all competing, ready to go,” said Trader, one of the most respected leaders in the locker room. “It’s kind of funny because I watched them come in the building today. All of them were locked in. You can’t even talk to them. It’s like, ‘All right, let’s go.’”The presumptive top contenders for the starting job are Billy Edwards Jr., a redshirt junior, and redshirt sophomores MJ Morris and Cameron Edge, but Coach Michael Locksley also praised the development of several freshmen. The competition remains wide open, according to Locksley, who indicated he may not reveal the starter publicly until the season opener Aug. 31 against Connecticut at SECU Stadium.Edwards is the closest thing Maryland has to an incumbent after he started in the Music City Bowl in December and was named most outstanding player in a 31-13 win over Auburn. The native of Springfield, Va., has three starts with the Terrapins, including two in 2022 when Tagovailoa was injured.Morris transferred late last year from North Carolina State, where he started seven games over two seasons and in 2022 became the first true freshman to start at quarterback for the Wolfpack since Philip Rivers in 2000. At Maryland, the dual threat shined at times during the spring game while acclimating to a new offense.“I can’t say enough about how hard all those guys have worked throughout this summer,” Locksley said. “We’ll let the battle play out through camp. I can tell you the guy that will play for us will be the guy that gives us the best chance to win. It’s not a popularity deal. If it takes two, it takes two. If we’ve got one, we’ll figure it out, but I feel good about the guys in the room and how they’ve prepared to compete.”So important is the process in naming the starter that Locksley has shifted much of his guidance specifically to the quarterbacks after devoting more attention to the offensive line last year. He’ll also consult frequently with offensive coordinator Josh Gattis, who is entering his second year, and associate head coach/co-offensive coordinator Kevin Sumlin, who has been close with Locksley for more than 30 years.Locksley’s quarterback evaluation model relies heavily on a drive chart he keeps close at hand during each portion of practice involving the quarterbacks. He takes special notice of how each drive ends.“Every drive should end in a kick if you’re a good quarterback,” Locksley said. “We should either be punting the ball, we should be kicking extra points, or we should be kicking field goals. If we’re ending drives with turnovers or ending drives with penalties and things like that, then that’s not playing winning football, so I can tell you the guy that does the best to put the team in position to score points and finish drives the right way will end up being the guy.”Edwards carved out a role last year in short-yardage situations and finished with a team-high seven rushing touchdowns, including three covering one yard each against then-No. 3 Michigan in a 31-24 loss Nov. 18 at SECU Stadium. He became the first Maryland quarterback in nearly a decade to rush for three touchdowns in a game.But Locksley cautioned not to underestimate Edwards’s skills as a passer, highlighted by the more than 5,000 yards and 59 touchdowns he compiled over two seasons at Lake Braddock High. Edwards was named all-Northern Region as a senior thanks to his 2,677 passing yards and 31 touchdowns with six interceptions.The only other quarterback to appear in a game for Maryland last season besides Tagovailoa and Edwards was Edge, a four-star recruit in ratings by 247Sports and ESPN in the high school Class of 2022. Edge played his most snaps last year in the Music City Bowl, completing 4 of 6 passes for 82 yards and a touchdown.Further down the projected depth chart are, among others, Jayden Sauray and Khristian Martin. Sauray, a redshirt sophomore, was a four-star prospect in 2022, according to ESPN, as well as the top-rated quarterback in the state when he directed Wise to the Maryland 4A championship in 2020.Martin, a freshman, was a three-star recruit, according to 247Sports and Rivals, after leading Highland Springs High outside Richmond to a 15-0 record and the Virginia Class 5 title in 2022.“We feel really, really good about that quarterback room,” Gattis said. “Obviously there was a deep competition going on in the spring. That competition is going to continue on through fall camp. For the moment, when we feel like we’ve identified the guy who’s going to lead us, we’ll obviously make that decision, but right now we’re just looking forward to seeing all of those young men take the next step.”"
WaPo_138,Iran vows revenge for killing of Hamas leader in Tehran,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/hamas-haniyeh-iran-israel-revenge/,2024-08-01 05:15:02.817066,,"Iran vowed to retaliate against Israel for the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran on Wednesday, an escalation in a years-long shadow war between the adversaries that in recent months has burst into the open with several high-profile attacks.“We consider it our duty to take vengeance” for the death of Ismail Haniyeh, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement. Khamenei blasted Israel for attacking the former political chief of Hamas while he was a “dear guest in our house.”Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack.The assassination of Haniyeh, who was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday, is a stinging embarrassment for the country’s security forces and a significant blow to one of its closest allies. Iran’s rulers didn’t say how they would respond. Some in the country were bracing for sweeping arrests.The Iranian government, gripped at home by a spiraling economic crisis and simmering unrest against increased social restrictions, has successfully dodged direct confrontation with Israel for months. Short of a miscalculation, analysts say, it is unlikely Haniyeh’s assassination will upset that balance.But Khamenei said Israel has “prepared a harsh punishment for itself,” and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned that any response would be “harsh and painful.” State television anchors read the statements during rolling coverage of the attack Wednesday.Haniyeh was one of the hundreds of leaders, diplomats and dignitaries in Tehran for Pezeshkian’s inauguration, an event that Pezeshkian said showcased “a powerful, peace-seeking, and dignified Iran.”Pezeshkian was elected on a wave of support for Iran’s reformists that appeared to reflect significant frustration with Iran’s clerical rulers. During his inaugural address, he promised that “constructive engagement” would be the “cornerstone” of his government’s foreign policy.But after news of the attack broke, Pezeshkian’s tone shifted.“The Islamic Republic of Iran will defend its territorial integrity, honor, pride and reputation,” Pezeshkian said in a statement posted on X on Wednesday with a photo of himself and Haniyeh on Tuesday clasping hands. Israel, he said, would “regret its cowardly action.”Many feared the attack, less than a full day into Pezeshkian’s term, has already derailed Pezeshkian’s plans for limited reform. Ordinary Iranians said the event was shocking and unsettling.“This shows how deeply they have penetrated the security grid of the Islamic Republic,” Reza, a 29-year-old pharmacist in Tehran, told The Washington Post. Speaking on the condition that his last name be withheld for fear of reprisals, he said he expected that any Iranian response would also involve its allies in Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza.The attack Wednesday followed an Israeli strike Tuesday that killed a senior Hezbollah leader in Lebanon. Israel claimed responsibility for the attack on Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr on the outskirts of Beirut on Tuesday night but refused to comment on the attack on Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday.Iran released little information about that attack, including where, exactly, it occurred. State media said Haniyeh was killed at 2 a.m. local time when a “raid” struck the guesthouse where he was staying in largely residential northern Tehran. Initial reports that it was an airstrike were not confirmed by officials.Support for Haniyeh, Hamas and other armed groups who openly attack Israel has been a defining element of Iran’s foreign policy for years. Tehran calls the groups the “Axis of Resistance,” a loose alliance that also includes the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon.Iranian commanders who work closely with the coalition were targeted in an Israeli airstrike in April. Two Iranian officers were killed in that attack on Iran’s diplomatic compound in Damascus.Iran responded with a highly telegraphed show of strength that appeared carefully calibrated to minimize actual damage — and limit further reprisals. The country launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, the majority of which were intercepted by Israeli missile defense systems. The sides avoided further escalation.The missile barrage was launched largely by Iranian forces from Iranian territory. Analysts say this round could see coordinated attacks by Iranian allies from other countries.“This wasn’t just a strike on Tehran,” said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at London’s Chatham House think tank. Unlike the April strike on Iranian personnel, she noted, the Wednesday attack targeted a non-Iranian senior member of Hamas, and so can be interpreted as an attack on all the groups allied with Iran.“It opens the door to an Axis-led response, not just an Iranian response,” she said.Iran announced plans for a funeral procession through central Tehran on Thursday morning. Mourners were told to gather at Tehran University and march to Azadi Square, a route often used for official state ceremonies.Haniyeh’s body is to be flown to Qatar for burial. Haniyeh had lived in exile in Qatar with other Hamas officials since the group’s Oct. 7 attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip triggered Israeli’s military campaign against the group.Inside Iran, people contacted by The Washington Post feared the prospect of mass arrests in the days ahead, similar to a spike in arrests that followed an attack claimed by the Islamic State group in Iran this year.Iran’s prosecutor general announced an investigation to hold people accountable for “negligence or fault” in Haniyeh’s death, according to state media. Activists warned that the government could use the attack as a pretext to cast a broad net.Frustration is still simmering over the government’s violent response to protests after the 2022 death in morality police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman detained for allegedly failing to wear a hijab properly. Social restrictions since then appeared to ease, but in recent months, security forces and morality police have returned to the country’s streets in force.Afshon Ostovar, a professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California, said Iran’s deep embarrassment over the security failures that allowed Wednesday’s attack will motivate the regime’s leadership to launch a highly visible response.“This is a cycle of retaliation,” he said. “Iran may not be able to stop Israel from hitting them, but every time they are hit, they can cause some pain.”"
WaPo_139,"U.S. men shake up starting lineup, shut down South Sudan in Group C win",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/us-mens-basketball-south-sudan-paris-olympics/,2024-08-01 05:12:02.817066,,"VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France — Sequels rarely live up to the originals, and the U.S. men’s basketball team had no intention of enduring another nail-biter against South Sudan.Nine days after the Americans needed a game-winning drive from LeBron James in the closing seconds to eke out a one-point thriller over South Sudan in a London exhibition, they cranked up the intensity to cruise to a 103-86 blowout victory Wednesday in their second group stage game of the Paris Olympics. The U.S. improved to 2-0 in Group C with the one-sided result, thereby clinching a spot in the quarterfinals, which begin Tuesday in Paris.Even before tip off, the Americans seemed intent to put on a show in front of 27,000 fans at Pierre Mauroy Stadium in northern France. James raced out of the locker room to treat the crowd to a full-court running dunk, and he was joined by Anthony Edwards and Kevin Durant in an impromptu dunk contest as game time approached. During their opening win against Serbia on Sunday, the Americans had to overcome boisterous support for their rivals. The crowd, which was fully in their favor this time around, broke into the wave early in the fourth quarter. One fan wearing Stephen Curry’s Golden State Warriors jersey held up a sign saying that he had “traveled 7,600 miles alone” for the chance to see James and Curry in person.The Americans’ magnetism was matched by their early energy, as their new-look starting lineup got out to a quick 6-0 lead and took a 55-36 advantage into halftime. U.S. Coach Steve Kerr started with James, Curry, Devin Booker, Jayson Tatum and Anthony Davis: Tatum, who didn’t play against Serbia, stepped in for Jrue Holiday, while Davis replaced Joel Embiid, who had started at center throughout the summer. Kevin Durant, who didn’t play in the U.S.'s five exhibition games, came off the bench for the second time in the Olympics.Thanks to the lineup changes, the Americans fielded a longer and more versatile lineup that was better suited to matching up with South Sudan, whose athleticism and outside shooting posed problems during their July 22 showdown in London. While Kerr said earlier this week that it was difficult to play more than 10 players during the Olympics’ 40-minute games, Embiid was the only member of the 12-man roster who didn’t take the court.Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo took full advantage within Kerr’s new big man rotation, scoring 14 of his team-high 18 points in the first half.. Davis, meanwhile, finished with eight points and seven rebounds after appearing to tweak his right ankle, but he delivered the exclamation point by turning a feed from James into a driving dunk midway through the fourth quarter. Five Americans finished in double figures, including Durant with 14 points and James with 12.Embiid, who struggled against Serbia, egged on fans who booed him when he took the court for warm-ups and hyped up the American starters as they took the court. The 2023 MVP has felt the wrath of the French crowds because he decided to join USA Basketball rather than play for France or Cameroon, where he also holds citizenship.Despite the defeat and a lack of current NBA players on its roster, South Sudan has acquitted itself very well in its first Olympics appearance thanks to its aggressive trapping defense and a perimeter-oriented attack.South Sudan put together an 8-0 run shortly after halftime to briefly make the Americans’ sweat, and Nuni Omot made three of five three-point attempts tallied a game-high 24 points. But the American defense held the South Sudanese offense in check down the stretch.The Americans will close Group C play against Puerto Rico (0-2) on Saturday. Nikola Jokic led Serbia to a 107-66 blowout of Puerto Rico earlier Wednesday. Serbia (1-1) will face South Sudan (1-1) on Friday with both teams still hoping to advance to the quarterfinals."
WaPo_140,This Nationals sell-off stopped at the perfect place,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/31/nationals-kyle-finnegan-trade-deadline/,2024-08-01 05:04:02.817066,,"Being a fan of a rebuilding team can feel like those biblical sufferings which often lasted 40 days and 40 nights. Except in baseball, the travails can last 40 times as long. Ask “How long, oh Lord?” and the answer can be, “Hey, just a couple more years.”In the last week, followers of the Nationals have been in the wilderness. If it’s not scorpions, it’s tarantulas riding rattlesnakes.After a 12-3 loss last Wednesday, the Nats were no-hit Thursday. Then they got walked off on consecutive nights in St. Louis and Arizona. The latter was especially brutal because all-star closer Kyle Finnegan should not, with hindsight, have pitched in the last game before the trade deadline. He blew an 8-4 lead thanks to five balls hit with an average exit velocity of infinity. His ERA jumped from 2.47 to 3.48 in 15 minutes.On Tuesday, the Nats couldn’t get a good enough deal to merit swapping Finnegan. Minus stalwarts Lane Thomas, Jesse Winker and Dylan Floro, all traded during the week, the Nats celebrated with a 17-0 loss.It’s not really this bad, honest. Before the recent misery began, the Nats were 47-53 and their season had been defined by the emergence, in their first or second seasons, of right-hander Jake Irvin, center fielder Jacob Young, left fielder James Wood and southpaw starters Mitchell Parker and DJ Herz.Nonetheless, the last week has brought into focus an eternal question for mediocre or losing teams and their fans — in other words, more than half of the sport. We know you may have to tear down before you can build back better. But does every rebuild have to be a total gut? Shouldn’t teams try to keep enough decent players — the kind who are unlikely to bring back star prospects in return — for the sake of some dignity?The Nationals and GM Mike Rizzo appear to have been committed to trading every single established player who was having a solid enough season to bring a credible return, all for the sake of 2025, or more likely, 2026. In “Team Building 101” — at least the currently acceptable version — this is the right method.The six prospects the Nats got for two expiring contracts (Winker and Floro) and two players under team control through 2025 (Thomas and reliever Hunter Harvey) are an organizational upgrade. That’s just the proper operating assumption with Rizzo deals. From the World Series team alone, Trea Turner, Howie Kendrick, Daniel Hudson, Asdrúbal Cabrera and Joe Ross and Gerardo Parra were added at a cost, in trades, of outfielder Stephen Souza, assorted minor leaguers and cash.Despite Rizzo’s history, including the 2022 Juan Soto trade that brought all-star CJ Abrams, lefty MacKenzie Gore, Wood and two of the Nats’ other top 12 prospects, I’m quite glad that Finnegan is still around.Of all the players the Nationals “should” have traded, given that indefinable commodity of “a good return,” Finnegan is the only one I hoped would stay. Why? On a team with five fairly promising starters in its rotation — Gore, Irvin, Parker, Herz and, pretty soon, Cade Cavalli — you absolutely need a solid closer; otherwise, panic will filter from the ninth into earlier innings and ruin the good work that your young arms have produced.On the other hand, if you do have the ninth inning covered — not with a 91-percent success savior like Mariano Rivera, or a star like Kenley Jansen, but just a credible Finnegan — then you can, maybe, patch together late innings of winnable games with folks like Derek Law (3.27 ERA), Jacob Barnes (3.59), Robert Garcia (4.26) and prospects like Jose A. Ferrer who need auditions.Subtract Finnegan and, to me, the risk is unpalatably high that your season, and much of your tightknit team culture, could disintegrate into humiliating rubble. It could anyway. Trading four of the better players on a team that’s on a 73-win pace can lead to a lot of ugliness.But all four moves were smart or close to inevitable.The Harvey trade was a clear winner because it freed up so much extra slot money for the Nats to lure high school players into their farm system rather than choose college. An SEC campus looks like paradise compared to life in the minor leagues. But if you add $1 million or even $2 million to sign, that equation can change. Harvey also netted the Royals’ No. 2 prospect, third baseman Cayden Wallace. Both teams may win. But the Nats could win bigger.Winker and Floro were signed to one-year deals so they could be flipped if they panned out. Both did. So, flip ‘em.As for what the Nats got in their six prospects plus that pick, I last covered a minor league game when Ronald Reagan was president. Even granting Rizzo’s good record in such deals, the hard truth is that if the Nats get three big leaguers, just two of them good, out of the seven, it’s a win.Lefty Alex Clemmey, a 6-foot-6 19-year-old with high-ceiling fastball-curveball stuff but hit-the-ceiling poor control, and Wallace, age 22, are now ranked as the Nats’ sixth- and seventh-best prospects, per MLB Pipeline. That’s good. It puts them just behind Cavalli (fifth) and ahead of outfielders Robert Hassell III and Cristhian Vaquero, and starting pitchers Jarlin Susana and Travis Sykora, all of whom are considered probable future big leaguers.Nats fans may think trading Thomas, who’s had an .835 OPS in his last 56 games after an awful first two months, was a difficult decision. It probably wasn’t. To a degree, the Nats’ two best hitting prospects, Wood and Dylan Crews, currently in AAA, made Winker and Thomas expendable. But it was really the unexpected value of Young — a Marvel Universe center fielder who ranks as the Nats’ second-best every day player (after Abrams), according to both FanGraphs and Baseball-Reference — that made a trade of Thomas so logical.Sometimes the best trade is the one you never make — or in the case of Finnegan, the potential trade that you happened to screw up. MLB front offices know that Finnegan’s 3.52 ERA in 272 games accurately reflects what advanced metrics say about his true ability. This year, his stellar ERA was part illusion, due to a .219 batting-average-on-balls-in-play. Reversion was due. But the Nats should have kept that illusion intact, hoping one team would want a 28-save all-star.Did Monday’s shelling influence Tuesday’s non-trade? Did the Nats miss a chance for another deal like all-star reliever Matt Capps for Wilson Ramos, a starting catcher for six years? We’ll never know, though “probably not” is the historian’s view.It’s possible that I put too much emphasis on finding pleasure in watching the Nats’ next 216 games. We live in a “where’s my ring” world, where the next parade is regarded, by some, as the only measuring stick. Titles are the ultimate goal, of course. But everything can’t be measured by a player’s yield in prospects.In Finnegan’s case, a solid closer is vital to giving the low-scoring Nats a decent chance to be competitive and watchable until all those “promises, promises” come true.With almost all franchises, watching a team rebuild is part of the lifelong experience of being a fan. There will be pain. But for the sake of fans’ pleasure and players’ morale, you don’t want to feel like that new building will fall on your head every night. With Finnegan in again, maybe it won’t."
WaPo_141,"Snoop Dogg’s journey from ‘Murder was the case’ to ‘What’s up, Mike Tirico’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/snoop-dogg-paris-olympic-pin-team-usa-hype-man/,2024-08-01 05:03:02.817066,,"During one prime-time broadcast of the Olympics gymnastics competition this week on NBC, Simone Biles finished a vault and the camera panned around Bercy Arena in Paris to find reactions. Biles’s parents politely clapped. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo cheered with a bit more gusto.Then the camera found Snoop Dogg, who lifted his glasses up toward his forehead, to reveal eyes wide in astonishment.“Snoop can’t believe what he saw!” said NBC’s Terry Gannon.There has been no better hype man for U.S. Olympians this week than Snoop, who has been everywhere in Paris for NBC — and, as a result, everywhere across the internet. Billie Jean King, a fellow Long Beach, Calif., native, snapped a photo with him; he did a swim lesson with Michael Phelps; and he narrated highlights of a spirited badminton rally. “It don’t stop till the casket drop,” Snoop said, as the shuttlecock flew back and forth.Since Snoop first made his mark on American culture as Dr. Dre’s running mate and then a rap star in his own right in the early 1990s, he has been many things: a boogeyman to White America, a reality TV star, Martha Stewart’s buddy, a pitchman for brands such as Skechers and Corona. Still, these Olympics have elevated Snoop to perhaps a new role.“I’m not sure who was betting on Snoop to be America’s sweetheart in the 1990s,” said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African American studies at Duke University. “No one saw this coming then.”Or as Jeff Chang, a cultural historian who has written several books on hip-hop, said: “He went from ‘Murder was the case that they gave me’ to ‘What’s up, Mike Tirico?’”NBC hired Snoop for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics to host a late-night highlights show with comedian Kevin Hart. Encouraged by the results, executives pitched him on coming back for more in Paris, as something of a roving correspondent. The result is a “Snoop SWAT team,” as it’s called internally, with two van loads carrying 12 people, including NBC staffers and Snoop’s personal attendants. The camera and social media folks trail Snoop wherever he goes: from event to event, to the Louvre, and on the train from Paris to Lille with the men’s basketball team.Already, he has appeared at the Novak Djokovic-Rafael Nadal match, with the U.S. judo team and the U.S. fencers, and at the swimming pool and the skate park.The schedule was planned out months in advance, which allowed Snoop to commission bespoke outfits for each day’s activities, including T-shirts and jackets bearing the likenesses of his favorite athletes — “Snoopians,” as NBC calls them — such as Biles and volleyball stars Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, as well as an array of colorful track suits and swimming robes.The segments offer comic relief, but they’re also heartwarming. Snoop is a fan, but he comes off as genuinely curious about the quirks of the Olympics and the athletes competing. “This is what y’all gonna have around your neck,” he told the U.S. women’s three-on-three basketball team, brandishing a gold medal. “You have to imagine it. You have to manifest it. ... You have to feel it.” During the lesson with Phelps, Snoop put on a swim cap, dog-paddled around a wading pool and joked about his strong lungs.“He’s really an ambassador of happiness,” said Molly Solomon, the executive producer of NBC’s Olympics coverage, which is seeing a rebound in viewership through the first few days of competition.(NBC viewers will see plenty more of Snoop after the Olympics, when he joins the “The Voice” as a coach.)To Neal, Snoop’s mainstream pivot began in earnest in the mid-2000s, when he starred in a reality-TV series that focused on parenting his kids. He was able to keep his credibility as an artist, Neal said, but also show a more universal side of himself. “You can go back to his very first music video, where he morphs into a dog,” Neal said. “It always suggested a softness beyond the gangster persona.”Chang noted that, for those who covered Snoop’s early career, including the murder trial in which he was acquitted in 1996, there can still be some cognitive dissonance to see Snoop chopping it up with Tirico on an NBC set that overlooks the Eiffel Tower.“I remember for a Vibe [magazine story], he was rendered in blue” — the color associated with the Crips — “and here he is in red, white and blue,” Chang said. “And I’m still watching on TV and noticing what colors he’s wearing.”Chang continued: “It’s a triumphal story. It’s a diverse generation of young people — many of whom were shut out of the mainstream — breaking through into the mainstream.”In Snoop’s early years, he was a voice of a disaffected generation of young Black men. He rapped about killing a police officer, and a cover of one of his albums was once called “pornographic smut” in a congressional hearing. (More recently, he said he would not refer to women in certain demeaning terms that were once a staple of his music.) That journey from outsider to ultimate cultural insider has been traversed by hip-hop, too; Flavor Flav of Public Enemy has also been a popular figure at these Games, if not at Snoop’s level.“He’s our lifestyle guru,” Neal said. “He’s like Uncle Stoner in a way that Willie Nelson wasn’t able to become for the mainstream. Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead never had that mainstream appeal, either.”He added: “I think we’re seeing something really fascinating and a kind of phenomenon with Snoop now.”And it’s a phenomenon that shows no sign of drifting away. Pin-trading is a well-established tradition at the Olympics, and one of this year’s hottest pins celebrates neither a country nor a sport. Instead, the pin features Snoop Dogg, exhaling Olympic rings of smoke.Another pin update, this time from Coco 😭 #olympics pic.twitter.com/remDy5FTTL"

WaPo_143,The anti-doping fight isn’t over whom to believe. It’s about transparency.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/wada-usada-chinese-swimmers-doping-allegations/,2024-08-01 05:52:02.817066,,"PARIS — A year ago, a Czech cyclist training in the United States tested positive for a banned substance that entered her system because she was handling a prescription medicine for her dying dog. Anti-doping authorities announced the results of the test — just as they announced there would be no penalty.Also last year, an American sprinter borrowed training sleeves from a friend to wear over an injured hamstring. The sleeves contained a banned substance. After an investigation concluded the sprinter shouldn’t be penalized, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the positive test anyway.In 2020, an American boxer tested positive for two banned substances that her partner was taking. An investigation determined the drugs entered her system through sex. She was exonerated in time to compete in the Tokyo Olympics the following summer. The positive tests still were disclosed.“As it stands, the WADA rules dictate that even if a positive test is proven to be caused by contamination, national anti-doping agencies must find a violation, disqualify results, and make a public announcement,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement issued Tuesday night.Which gets us to the Paris Olympics. And the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for banned substances three years ago. And the results that weren’t announced.There is all-out war between two agencies that are supposed to pull on the same end of the rope. It’s not going away. If anything, it’s escalating.“The politicization of Chinese swimming continues with this latest attempt by the media in the United States to imply wrongdoing on the part of WADA and the broader anti-doping community,” WADA said in a lengthy statement issued Tuesday. “As we have seen over recent months, WADA has been unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that.”Ya’ gotta feel for them, don’t ya'?The story has not stopped the Olympic swim meet in its tracks, not hardly. That’s because the Chinese swimmers have been held largely at bay. After winning 10 golds in Tokyo — second behind the United States’ 12 — and 20 medals overall, China has one gold, delivered Wednesday night with a world record in the men’s 100-meter freestyle from Pan Zhanle, to go with two silvers and two bronzes here as the meet reaches its midpoint. Zhanle’s performance led to the Chinese anthem filling La Défense Arena for the first time.On Tuesday night, Qin Haiyang — the reigning world champion in both the men’s 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes — failed to reach the final of the latter event, in which he holds the world record. This after he finished seventh in the 100 earlier in the meet. Wednesday morning, Xu Jiayu, who won one of China’s silvers in the 100 backstroke, failed to even show up for his heat in the 200 back. No immediate reason was given.It’s dangerous to consider those results and actions and conclude, “The Chinese must be missing something they relied on in Tokyo.” But WADA’s combination of inaction and secrecy has only bolstered such speculation.Forget the “politicization of Chinese swimming.” This is a mess of WADA’s own making. And it’s important to clean it up — not just for the Paris Games, but for faith in the global system to ensure clean international competition going forward.The American media WADA refers to is the New York Times, which reported earlier Tuesday that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive for banned substances — in this case, a hardcore steroid — but blamed it on contaminated meat. (One of those swimmers is on the Olympic team here.) But it also could and should include the German outlet ARD, which with the Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine leading up to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and that Chinese anti-doping authorities blamed on contamination in a hotel kitchen, an explanation that WADA accepted but didn’t announce. Last week, ARD further reported that those swimmers didn’t all stay at the same hotel.“A fundamental question at the heart of any claimed contamination case, which WADA refuses to answer in these cases, is what was the source of the positives?” Tygart’s latest statement said. “The fact that WADA accepted these excuses and declined to enforce its own rules is a failure of the system.”All this led to saber-rattling across the Atlantic. On Tuesday, a bipartisan congressional delegation announced legislation that would withhold the United States’ contribution to WADA’s budget — a $3.4 million contribution to a roughly $50 million annual budget.The swept-under-the-rug Chinese positives could make WADA seem toothless. And to the athletes who swam in Tokyo and are competing here against 11 of those swimmers, it is — regardless of China’s poor performance in the pool thus far.But tell that to the scores of athletes WADA has suspended over the years, even those who have claimed inadvertent ingestion. There’s Shelby Houlihan, the American record-holder in the women’s 1,500 meters who is missing her second Olympics after a positive test for the steroid nandrolone — that she blamed on a tainted burrito. There’s Issam Asinga, the Surinamese sprinter who set American high school records but is serving a four-year ban after testing positive for the banned substance GW1516, which alters how the body metabolizes fat. Asinga is suing Gatorade, which he says supplied him tainted gummies that were supposed to help with recovery.Whether you believe Houlihan or Asinga, they’re not here because WADA said they can’t be.“I just think this idea that somehow they’re soft on doping is unfair,” said Paul Greene, an American attorney who has represented athletes in doping cases for two decades. “I know from my years and years of dealing with them, if anything, they’re rigid.”What they are is inconsistent, and the reaction — particularly in the United States or from American athletes and observers — risks being horribly xenophobic. You can’t say, “Poor kid from Suriname, he should be here,” and follow it reflexively with, “We’re not going to fund you unless you suspend the Chinese.”But WADA also needs to admit that it didn’t handle the China cases properly. Beyond that, both WADA and the International Olympic Committee need to understand that the timing of the unpublicized positives — less than a year in advance of the Beijing Winter Games — makes the optics awful, quietly clearing athletes from one of the few countries eager to host future Olympics.Beyond that, the IOC must understand the threats it is making to yank the 2034 Winter Games from Salt Lake City unless Americans bow to WADA as the “supreme authority” on all things doping are laughable. Where else would they turn? Beyond that, WADA must come to the conclusion that its blended relationship with the IOC — half of the budget comes from countries around the world, the other half from the IOC — cripples its ability to police doping as an independent agency.American outcry is not the reason WADA’s structure is flawed and its actions open to suspicion. Both problems are solvable, but only if both the IOC and WADA understand that public perception matters when it comes to faith.

WaPo_145,Journalists tussle with Trump during raucous on-stage interview,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/31/journalists-tussle-with-trump-during-raucous-on-stage-interview/,2024-08-01 06:57:02.749288,,"The fireworks started almost immediately during former President Donald Trump’s interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. ABC News senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott, one of three moderators, kicked things off with a question about Trump’s past race-related controversies.“You have told four congresswomen of color who are American citizens to go back where they came from. You have used words like ‘animal’ and ‘rabid’ to describe Black district attorneys,” she said — asking “why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?” Trump responded by calling the question “disgraceful” and Scott’s manner “horrible.”That set the tone for a contentious interview during which the questioners pushed back repeatedly, often tussling with Trump and rebutting his assertions.When Trump said that “illegal aliens"" are coming to the United States and being given the opportunity to vote, Scott responded that “people who are only American citizens are allowed to vote.""When Trump said that Democrats “are allowing abortion in the ninth month"" and are “allowing the death of a baby after the baby is born,” Scott responded: “Sir, that is illegal in every state in the country,"" while Semafor reporter Kadia Goba countered that “Democrats have denied that.” (Trump made a similar comment during the June 27 presidential debate, receiving no pushback from CNN’s moderators.)The Trump interview was controversial before it even started, leading to statements of condemnation from prominent Black journalists who decried the NABJ for holding the event at all, claiming it would help “normalize” Trump. (The organization also attempted to book an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.)Throughout his presidency and in the years that have followed, interviewing Trump has remained a singularly challenging task, with many journalists facing criticism for either not sufficiently challenging his assertions, being too combative in doing so, or for talking to him in the first place.The NABJ moderators received largely positive reviews on social media for their performance on Wednesday. “Incredibly proud of @rachelvscott and @kadiagoba today. Substantive but tough questioning.” CNN anchor Abby Phillip wrote on X.Some commenters likened the performance to the approach taken by political journalist Jonathan Swan, who in the summer of 2020 beguiled Trump with basic follow-up questions and requests for clarifications.Among the many headlines generated by the interview, Trump said a vice presidential candidate historically “makes no difference"" politically when asked by Fox News’ Harris Faulkner about his choice of JD Vance as his running mate. Trump also questioned Harris’ racial identity, saying she only recently “became Black.""When Goba referenced Trump’s past divorces in a question about Vance, leading to murmurs from the crowd, the former president defused the tension by saying “at least it was said in a friendly manner.”Faulkner reacted with an “oh my goodness” when Trump again referenced “this woman” Scott’s “rude” questioning of him. A member of the audience then said loudly, “No, she did not,” to which Trump said, “She was very rude, sir.”Continuing his criticism of Scott, Trump said her opening question was actually a “statement,"" not a question. “I repeated your statements, sir, actually,” Scott replied.Scott also tussled with Trump over a question about whether he would pardon the individuals convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. “Have you seen that video, sir? You would pardon those rioters?""After the event concluded, CNN’s Phillip praised the NABJ’s decision to host Trump, which she said “produced one of the newsiest interviews with him this year.”Political strategist and MSNBC contributor Tim Miller agreed. “This NABJ interview is a great example of why the people who demand that we de-platform Trump are wrong,"" he wrote on X.Fox News commentator Tyrus felt differently about how the moderators performed. Referring to Scott, he said on the network’s 5 p.m. program that “she was there for one reason: to get talking sound bites for the Democrats, trying to get him to be mean and nasty.”"
WaPo_146,Leon Marchand becomes prince of the Paris pool after historic double-gold,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/leon-marchand-butterfly-breaststroke-gold-medals-paris-olympics/,2024-08-01 06:55:02.749288,,"NANTERRE, France — All that was required of Leon Marchand to fulfill the mission he set out Wednesday night was to pull off a pair of victories in two disparate strokes no swimmer had ever conquered in the same Olympics, survive a 110-minute gap between swims without cramping up or cooling down, vanquish one seemingly unbeatable world record holder and one imposing Olympic record-holder — and do it all in a stadium, Paris La Defense Arena, where the vast majority in attendance had come to see their hero prevail, twice, and would have been devastated by anything less.It was aggressive. It was audacious. It was unprecedented. It was the kind of thing only a 22-year-old kid with preternatural talent and a willingness to chase a singular type of greatness would even try. In a sense, it was madness. And in the end, it was spectacular.Anyone who witnessed Marchand’s historic 200-meter butterfly/200-meter breaststroke at the Paris Olympics will be left with one final sound ringing in their heads, for the rest of this night if not an eternity: the deafening, rhythmic, sing-shouted chant that accompanied each bob of his head as he took it home in the breaststroke — “Allez! Allez!” “Allez!”When it was over, his eighth and final length of the pool, Marchand, the new prince of France, sat on the lane line as if he had conquered the world — which in a sense he had. He slapped the water in triumph, fell back into the adjacent lane, pulled himself out of the pool, looked around in satisfied triumph and thrust both arms in the air.“It will take a while for me to realize” the magnitude of the moment, Marchand said. Asked at what point he began to believe this was possible, he said, “I knew it was possible to finish those races, maybe not win them.”The barest facts don’t do justice to the immenseness of Marchand’s night, but here they are: He won the 200 fly in a time of 1 minute 51.21 seconds, then won the 200 breast in 2:05.85, both of them Olympic records. The two victories give him three gold medals so far in these Olympics — the third coming Sunday night in the 400-meter individual medley — with one more individual event to go. He will return to La Defense Arena on Thursday morning for the preliminary heats of the 200 IM, the final for which is Friday night.But the further you zoom out from the granular details, the more astounding it becomes. Not only had no swimmer in history won those two events at the same Olympics — no swimmer had even won butterfly and breaststroke races of any length in the same Olympics. Of the few who have even attempted it, American Mary Sears came closest, earning bronze in the 100 fly and finishing seventh in the 200 breast.Zoom out further. No swimmer in the last 48 years had won two individual Olympic gold medals on the same night. Not Michael Phelps, who pulled off many individual/relay doubles, but never double-golds in individual events. Not Ryan Lochte, who twice earned two medals in individual events on the same night (2008, 2012), but never two golds.The last to do it was East Germany’s Kornelia Ender, who won both 200 free and 100 fly on July 22, 1976 in Montreal. (Although it was later revealed East German officials had systematically administered steroids to its swimmers — including Ender, who has maintained she did not know what she was being given — their records have been allowed to stand.)Here’s how long it has been since a male swimmer won two individual Olympic golds on the same day: That swimmer, Australia’s Frederick Lane, according to the website Olympedia.org, swam his races in the Seine, and the second of them was a race — the 200-meter obstacle course, in which swimmers were made to go over and under various poles and boats — that never made another appearance on the Olympic program. The year was 1900.The original Olympic swimming schedule for Paris 2024 had the 200 breast and 200 fly as back-to-back events — which organizers believed to be logical, since no one had ever heard of someone swimming both of those disparate events at the same international meet.But as Marchand and his coach, Bob Bowman, began zeroing in on that precise double, they realized they had a problem with the timing. So the French swimming federation lobbied the sport’s international governing body, World Aquatics, for a schedule change, and it was granted — resulting in the placement of those two events at the opposite ends of Wednesday night’s program.But up until a few days ago, Bowman was not even sure he wanted Marchand to attempt such a grueling and head-spinning double, figuring it might be more prudent to scratch one of them, likely the fly, in the name of optimizing Marchand’s chances in the other.“But he was pretty confident,” said Bowman, who also coached Phelps to his record 23 Olympic golds. “He knew more than me.”Still, to pull it off the historic feat would require swimming’s version of the triple-double: Marchand would have to swim the fly/breast double at three different sessions in the span of about 32 hours — in morning prelims Tuesday, in semifinals Tuesday night and again in the finals Wednesday night.“I’ve done way more difficult [doubles] in NCAAs,” said Marchand, who swam collegiately at Arizona State and frequently swam individual breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle events, sometimes on the same day.His confidence seemed to grow with each swim here. And on Wednesday night, when Marchand came from behind on the final 50 meters to take down Hungarian star Kristof Milak in the 200 fly, he punctuated it with a raised index finger: One down, one to go.Marchand had trailed Milak by more than half a second at the halfway point of the fly, but unleashed a furious turn and underwater kick at the 150-meter wall and caught his rival down the stretch to claim his second gold — as well as move past Phelps into the No. 2 position all-time, behind only Milak. Ilya Kharun took bronze in 1:52.80, earning Canada its first Olympic medal by a male swimmer since 2012.“I could hear the whole pool going crazy,” Marchand said of the final 50. “I think that’s why I was able to win: I really used that energy from the crowd.”From the time Marchand pulled himself out of the pool at the end of the fly to the time he was back on the starting blocks for the final of the breaststroke was roughly 1 hour 50 minutes, during which time he would try to rehydrate, reduce the lactic acid in his system through deep-breathing and keep his muscles loose through gentle stretching exercises.Oh, right — he also had to appear on the top step of the medal stand, which he did to roaring applause, and lead the stadium in another stirring, full-throated rendition of “La Marseillaise.” He did, however, skip the victory lap around the stadium afterward, choosing to duck out through a side door and return to his race-recovery program.In the breaststroke, he never trailed, beating defending champ Zac Stubblety-Cook of Australia by almost a full second and bronze medalist Caspar Corbeau of the Netherlands by more than two. The whole nearly two-minute affair was accompanied by the rhythmic “Allez!” chant, which even the swimmers whose heads were beneath the surface could feel pulsing through their swim caps.“It didn’t feel like a swim meet,” Stubblety-Cook said. “It felt like a rugby match.”Marchand, born in Toulouse, developed in Tempe, crowned in Paris, now has stamped himself as the most fascinating swimmer of his generation, if not the most flat-out talented. He has really been an international force for just two years, but already it is clear there is no one else like him.And maybe there has never been anyone like him, with his unique set of skills and strokes and substance. It would appear there is almost nothing in the sport he can’t do, though until proven otherwise, one must assume the 200-meter obstacle course would give him a world of trouble."
WaPo_147,Gen X and millennials at higher cancer risk than older generations,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/cancer-rates-younger-generations/,2024-08-01 06:29:02.749288,,"Generation X and millennials are at an increased risk of developing certain cancers compared with older generations, a shift that is probably due to generational changes in diet, lifestyle and environmental exposures, a large new study suggests.In a new study published Wednesday in the Lancet Public Health journal, researchers from the American Cancer Society reported that cancer rates for 17 of the 34 most common cancers are increasing in progressively younger generations. The findings included:“It is a concern,” said Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of the American Cancer Society’s surveillance and health equity science department, who was the senior author of the study.If the current trend continues, the increased cancer and mortality rates among younger people may “halt or even reverse the progress that we have made in reducing cancer mortality over the past several decades,” he added.While there is no clear explanation for the increased cancer rates among younger people, the researchers suggest that there may be several contributing factors, including rising obesity rates; altered microbiomes from unhealthy diets high in saturated fats, red meat and ultra-processed foods or antibiotic use; poor sleep; sedentary lifestyles; and environmental factors, including exposure to pollutants and carcinogenic chemicals.Researchers analyzed data from more than 23.5 million patients who had been diagnosed with 34 types of cancer from 2000 to 2019. They also studied mortality data that included 7 million deaths from 25 types of cancer among people ages 25 to 84 in the United States.Expanding on their previous research, which had identified eight types of cancer in which incidence rates increased among younger generations, the researchers have found an additional nine, including some that had previously declined among older birth cohorts before rising in younger populations.The study did not examine factors including household income, insurance status, race or ethnicity.Younger people, or those under 50, represent a minority of the overall population of those who develop cancer, “but the concern is that cancer is occurring at younger and younger ages, so this increased incidence raises very real concerns as that population continues to age,” said Ernest Hawk, vice president and head of the division of cancer prevention and population sciences at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.At the same time, the researchers also noted that there has been a drop in cervical cancer rates among younger women, which they attribute to vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Smoking-related cancers such as lung, larynx and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma also declined, though progress has slowed among the youngest age groups, the researchers said.Routine screening tests are recommended for only four cancers — colon, cervical, breast and, for some people, lung — and a number of younger people who are at average risk do not meet the age requirements or, for various reasons, are not getting screened. Some experts have pointed to potential harms from widespread screening, including false positives that may take a psychological toll and lead to unnecessary follow-up tests and procedures.“The problem becomes that patients are getting younger and younger, we don’t always have good screening to begin with, and then we can’t really screen such large populations,” said Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal oncologist and co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.In the new study, breast, gallbladder and other biliary cancers, and uterine cancer rates increased across almost all age groups, rising faster among younger generations. While breast cancer rates among women younger than 40 remain low, in a separate study, breast cancer still accounted for the highest number of early-onset cancer cases.Recent and growing evidence showing that more women in their 40s are getting breast cancer prompted the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force last year to change its previous guidance, lowering the age for routine screening mammograms from age 50 to 40.Routine mammograms are not as effective for women with dense breasts, however, which is more common among those who are younger, said Elizabeth Comen, a breast cancer oncologist and associate professor at New York University Langone Health’s Perlmutter Cancer Center.“Understanding how we can better screen and detect cancers in younger patients is a massive unmet need,” said Comen, who added that many of her younger patients find their own breast cancer.In recent years, the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening was also lowered, from age 50 to 45, as research has shown a trend toward  diagnoses at younger ages. The new study found that increases in stomach and colorectal cancer rates were confined to younger age groups, meaning that while colorectal cancer rates are declining overall, there is a rise in incidence in younger populations.But many people who are eligible are not getting colorectal cancer screenings. A 2021 study reported that fewer than 4 million of the eligible 19 million adults ages 45 to 49 years were up-to-date on screenings, which can include a newly approved blood test, a stool test or a visual test such as a colonoscopy or CT colonography.Even when symptoms arise, “I think many younger folks ignore them, thinking they cannot get cancer because they’re young,” said Rashmi Verma, an oncologist who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers at the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California at Davis, adding that she has treated patients as young as 20.Others may be uninsured or not aware that screening tests are recommended for them, experts said.When some younger patients seek care for gastrointestinal symptoms, they are misdiagnosed with other conditions such as hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome, so it is important to consult a gastroenterologist, Verma said.But for most cancers, including pancreatic cancer, there are no screening tests — at any age — which can lead to late diagnoses and more limited treatment options, experts said.While there have been advances in diagnostics and treatment, oftentimes, malignant pancreatic tumors (and some others) are discovered incidentally during imaging for other issues, said Charles J. Yeo, a professor and chair of the department of surgery at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University.The increasing cancer rates among younger generations highlights the need for further study to both pinpoint a cause for planning prevention as well as to develop better — and, in many cases, any — screening tests to help detect cancers in younger people earlier in the course of disease when treatment is often more effective, experts said.The rising rates also raise questions about what happens to younger patients in survivorship.“There are going to be young cancer survivors who are deeply impacted biologically, physically and psychologically from these diagnoses,” Comen said. “And that’s going to have a ripple effect in our society that our medical community needs to be equipped to address.”"
WaPo_148,Rare Outer Banks stallion euthanized after being hit by off-road vehicle,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/31/endangered-horse-killed/,2024-08-01 06:27:02.749288,,"A bay stallion bucked in a beachfront meadow in eastern North Carolina last week, trying to kick his rival, steal away the nearby mares and bring them into his own small harem.He was one of the Outer Banks’ few remaining horses descended directly from Spanish explorers’ horses, a brown-haired, 10-year-old stallion named Bullwinkle. And just days later, he was buried near the same grassy field after being struck by an off-road utility vehicle late Friday night.The richly colored bay horse was dubbed “Bullwinkle” by the nonprofit that oversees the herd during his days as a young bachelor when he banded together with other males, including one named “Rocky.” He was part of Corolla, N.C.'s herd of about 100 Banker horses, a breed that can be traced back to those brought over by the Spanish in the 1500s. Just around 200 remain along the beaches of the Outer Banks, drawing flocks of sightseers to the beach, according to the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, the nonprofit that helps oversee their care and protection.“Bullwinkle died as wild as he lived,” read a social media post from the organization. “At no point did he welcome our intervention and he remained wary and defensive even as he laid on the dune unable to stand anymore. The fight drive that he was always known for never left him, right up to the end.”“He was in the prime of his life, and went from being a symbol of what it means to be wild and free to a tragic example of how irresponsible, reckless human behavior can cause pain, suffering, and irreparable damage to the herd in an instant,” continued the post.According to a Currituck County Sheriff’s Office news release, law enforcement responded to a call of a horse having been struck by a utility terrain vehicle, a type of work vehicle that’s a cross between a four-wheeler and golf cart. The owner of the vehicle was identified in the post as Porter Williamson, 57, of Chesapeake, Va., whom The Washington Post could not reach for comment.According to the release, Williamson initially fled the scene and was later apprehended by officers on foot. He has been charged with “resist, delay, obstruct” and was released hours later on a $10,000 bond, according to the Currituck County Sheriff’s Office.A second person, Rhonda Williamson, faces the same charges and was released early Saturday morning on a $5,000 bond, though the agency did not disclose her involvement.Meg Puckett, who serves as the Herd Manager for the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, told The Post she was notified late Friday night that Bullwinkle had been gravely injured and sustained significant internal trauma and damage to his rear legs.“This group of horses is basically one of the last two groups that are left of the original Spanish stock that were bred by the Spanish for exploration,” said Craig Young, Corolla Wild Horse Fund Operations Manager. Feral mustangs like the Bankers are why domestic American horses today come in such a wide variety of colors, like bay, chestnut and black, Young said. They’re small, stocky and hardy, with wide hoofs to navigate sandy North Carolina beaches.Young, who led local horse tours before beginning work at the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, said people come from all around the world to see them, with some considering the sight a bucket-list item.Just one other herd of Banker horses exists outside Corolla, farther south on Shackleford Banks, N.C. Those horses are confined to federal land and are overseen by the National Park Service and another nonprofit, said Puckett.The horses in Corolla are officially overseen at the county level, Puckett told The Post, and despite being the state horse of North Carolina, they lack state or federal protection. Former Rep. Walter B. Jones Jr. (R-N.C.), who died in 2019, introduced a bill in the House over a decade ago to codify the horses’ protection, but it failed to pass.Puckett said that local ordinances dictate people remain at least 50 feet away from the horses at all times, and avoid feeding them to ensure horses don’t become dependent or aggressive toward humans.“They’re really good problem solvers; they think really critically,” Puckett said. Unlike most other horses, which are prey animals, and are easily frightened, Banker horses are famously laid back. “They’re not reactionary, they’re not spooky,” Puckett said. “And I think that serves them really, really well when they’re surrounded by people in cars and garbage and fences.”Compared to domestic horses, Young said, “the one thing about them that's very different is that they don't need us. They’ve been here for 500 years figuring it out.”“They really just need us to stay out of their way.”"
WaPo_149,"Gail Lumet Buckley, writer who traced Black achievement, dies at 86",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/31/gail-lumet-buckley-lena-horne/,2024-08-01 06:10:02.749288,,"Gail Lumet Buckley, a writer whose books combined history and memoir to highlight Black achievement in the United States, often through the prism of her own family, including her mother, entertainer Lena Horne, died July 18 at her daughter’s home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 86.She had heart ailments, said her daughter Jenny Lumet, a writer and film producer.As the daughter of the first major Black movie star, Mrs. Buckley had a childhood touched with glamour and privilege — “part Hollywood … and part Ivy League,” she wrote — yet with a persistent undercurrent of racism. Her mother had battled discrimination as a dancer and singer in segregated nightclubs of the 1930s, before turning down film roles she considered demeaning. For years, she told her daughter little about those struggles.In the early 1980s, Mrs. Buckley discovered a trunk kept by her grandfather — Horne’s father — that was crammed with photographs and documents, including letters, diaries, diplomas and receipts for gambling debts.“It all unfolded like a detective story,” Mrs. Buckley told the Los Angeles Times, as she assembled those raw materials for her first book, the best-selling “The Hornes: An American Family” (1986). She followed her lineage back six generations to her great-great-great-great-grandmother Sinai Reynolds, who was born into slavery in Maryland in the late 1770s — and was able to purchase freedom for herself and her children when she was in her 80s.“The Hornes” recounted the family history from enslavement through emancipation and Reconstruction to professional achievement and prosperity, as various descendants moved to New York and the Midwest, while others remained in the South.Much of the book was about her mother, whose childhood was divided between Georgia and Brooklyn. Some of Horne’s elders were disappointed when she entered show business, considering it beneath her.In her book, Mrs. Buckley revealed her mother’s clandestine affair in the 1940s with boxing champion Joe Louis, who was married at the time, and her dispute with Ethel Waters, her co-star in the 1943 movie musical “Cabin in the Sky.”When Horne finished reading the manuscript, she cried — with pride at her daughter’s accomplishment.“What I love the most about it,” Horne told the New York Times in 1986, “is the description of the mother-daughter relationship. … I know it must have been hard for Gail to have had a mother who most of the time wore another hat.”During her research for “The Hornes,” Mrs. Buckley found a photograph of a great-uncle, Errol Horne, a career soldier who helped pursue Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa south across the Texas border and later fought in World War I. The photograph helped inspire her second book, “American Patriots: The Story of Blacks in the Military From the Revolution to Desert Storm” (2001).Mrs. Buckley began her account with Crispus Attucks, a sailor of African and Indigenous descent who was killed by British troops in the Boston Massacre of 1770, helping trigger the American Revolution. She discovered that up to 15 percent of the soldiers in the Revolution were Black, making elements of the Continental Army the country’s most integrated fighting force until the Vietnam War.Her well-received study — “an important and readable book on a topic that should be of interest to all Americans,” historian John Whiteclay Chambers II wrote in The Washington Post — received the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award.In 2016, Mrs. Buckley returned to her personal roots with “The Black Calhouns: From Civil War to Civil Rights With One African American Family.” She told the story of her great-great-grandfather Moses Calhoun, who was born into slavery in Georgia. He was among the few enslaved people of that era who learned to read.When he was emancipated at the end of the Civil War, he went into business for himself, eventually becoming one of the richest Black people in Atlanta. His two daughters both graduated from college, and one of them, Cora Calhoun Horne, had a crucial role in raising her granddaughter — Lena Horne.Despite her mother’s fame, Mrs. Buckley wrote, her “skin was still black and she still faced the discrimination that all blacks felt — except on a different scale. She felt she had been a good little symbol, but nothing had changed; in the South, blacks still could not vote and their children could not get a decent education.”Gail Horne Jones was born Dec. 21, 1937, in Pittsburgh, where her mother was living with her first husband, Louis Jordan Jones, a postal worker and businessman. The couple had a son three years later, but Lena Horne longed to return to her budding career as a singer and actress, and the marriage soon ended.Gail’s brother, Teddy, stayed in Pittsburgh at her father’s insistence, while she and her mother moved to Brooklyn and later to Los Angeles. In 1947, Horne married Lennie Hayton, a White composer and conductor in Hollywood. (They were married in France because interracial marriage was illegal in California at the time.)“My mother and I therefore entered the great ‘white’ world, where we lived not as white people, but like white people,” Mrs. Buckley wrote in “The Hornes.” She went to elementary school with Natalie Wood and the children of Hollywood stars, and she lived across the street from actor Humphrey Bogart. She spent summers in Europe with her mother and stepfather.Mrs. Buckley attended a Quaker boarding school in Upstate New York because it was among the few integrated private schools of the era. She studied at Radcliffe College, a women’s school in Cambridge, Mass., that later merged with Harvard, graduating in 1959.“She lived in a house with several other very glamorous girls,” a fellow Radcliffe student, author Frances FitzGerald, recalled in an interview. “She was remarkably lively, a real presence, and very funny — not what you would expect of a lonely child.”In college, Mrs. Buckley briefly tried acting, then after her graduation worked at a fashion magazine in Paris. After returning to New York, she advised Black students seeking college scholarships before joining the staff of Life magazine as a researcher in 1962.The following year, she married director Sidney Lumet, whose acclaimed films included “12 Angry Men,” “Serpico” and “Network.” They had two daughters and were later divorced.In the early 1980s, FitzGerald introduced her old college friend to journalist Kevin Buckley, and the two were married in 1983. The couple often presided over salon-like gatherings at their Manhattan apartment, with guests including professors, writers, clergy members and the occasional luminary from politics or Hollywood.Mrs. Buckley published her most recent book, “Radical Sanctity: Race and Radical Women in the American Catholic Church,” last year.While working on her books, Mrs. Buckley cared for her aging mother, who died in 2010 at 92. After her husband’s death in 2021, Mrs. Buckley moved to California. Survivors include her two daughters, Jenny Lumet of Santa Monica and Amy Lumet, a film producer, of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.“I identify myself as African American to let others know that I am one of America’s historical stepchildren,” Mrs. Buckley wrote in “The Black Calhouns.” She and her mother both understood that the issue of race would never be absent from their lives.Once, when Horne was appearing in Las Vegas, her daughter took a swim in the hotel pool. Mrs. Buckley wrote that a White woman told the manager she would leave the hotel if the young Black girl — Mrs. Buckley — was not banished from the pool.“Ma’am,” the manager replied, “may I carry your bags now?”"

Biles’s parents politely clapped. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo cheered with a bit more gusto.Then the camera found Snoop Dogg, who lifted his glasses up toward his forehead, to reveal eyes wide in astonishment.“Snoop can’t believe what he saw!” said NBC’s Terry Gannon.There has been no better hype man for U.S. Olympians this week than Snoop, who has been everywhere in Paris for NBC — and, as a result, everywhere across the internet. Billie Jean King, a fellow Long Beach, Calif., native, snapped a photo with him; he did a swim lesson with Michael Phelps; and he narrated highlights of a spirited badminton rally. “It don’t stop till the casket drop,” Snoop said, as the shuttlecock flew back and forth.Since Snoop first made his mark on American culture as Dr. Dre’s running mate and then a rap star in his own right in the early 1990s, he has been many things: a boogeyman to White America, a reality TV star, Martha Stewart’s buddy, a pitchman for brands such as Skechers and Corona. Still, these Olympics have elevated Snoop to perhaps a new role.“I’m not sure who was betting on Snoop to be America’s sweetheart in the 1990s,” said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African American studies at Duke University. “No one saw this coming then.”Or as Jeff Chang, a cultural historian who has written several books on hip-hop, said: “He went from ‘Murder was the case that they gave me’ to ‘What’s up, Mike Tirico?’”NBC hired Snoop for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics to host a late-night highlights show with comedian Kevin Hart. Encouraged by the results, executives pitched him on coming back for more in Paris, as something of a roving correspondent. The result is a “Snoop SWAT team,” as it’s called internally, with two van loads carrying 12 people, including NBC staffers and Snoop’s personal attendants. The camera and social media folks trail Snoop wherever he goes: from event to event, to the Louvre, and on the train from Paris to Lille with the men’s basketball team.Already, he has appeared at the Novak Djokovic-Rafael Nadal match, with the U.S. judo team and the U.S. fencers, and at the swimming pool and the skate park.The schedule was planned out months in advance, which allowed Snoop to commission bespoke outfits for each day’s activities, including T-shirts and jackets bearing the likenesses of his favorite athletes — “Snoopians,” as NBC calls them — such as Biles and volleyball stars Sara Hughes and Kelly Cheng, as well as an array of colorful track suits and swimming robes.The segments offer comic relief, but they’re also heartwarming. Snoop is a fan, but he comes off as genuinely curious about the quirks of the Olympics and the athletes competing. “This is what y’all gonna have around your neck,” he told the U.S. women’s three-on-three basketball team, brandishing a gold medal. “You have to imagine it. You have to manifest it. ... You have to feel it.” During the lesson with Phelps, Snoop put on a swim cap, dog-paddled around a wading pool and joked about his strong lungs.“He’s really an ambassador of happiness,” said Molly Solomon, the executive producer of NBC’s Olympics coverage, which is seeing a rebound in viewership through the first few days of competition.(NBC viewers will see plenty more of Snoop after the Olympics, when he joins the “The Voice” as a coach.)To Neal, Snoop’s mainstream pivot began in earnest in the mid-2000s, when he starred in a reality-TV series that focused on parenting his kids. He was able to keep his credibility as an artist, Neal said, but also show a more universal side of himself. “You can go back to his very first music video, where he morphs into a dog,” Neal said. “It always suggested a softness beyond the gangster persona.”Chang noted that, for those who covered Snoop’s early career, including the murder trial in which he was acquitted in 1996, there can still be some cognitive dissonance to see Snoop chopping it up with Tirico on an NBC set that overlooks the Eiffel Tower.“I remember for a Vibe [magazine story], he was rendered in blue” — the color associated with the Crips — “and here he is in red, white and blue,” Chang said. “And I’m still watching on TV and noticing what colors he’s wearing.”Chang continued: “It’s a triumphal story. It’s a diverse generation of young people — many of whom were shut out of the mainstream — breaking through into the mainstream.”In Snoop’s early years, he was a voice of a disaffected generation of young Black men. He rapped about killing a police officer, and a cover of one of his albums was once called “pornographic smut” in a congressional hearing. (More recently, he said he would not refer to women in certain demeaning terms that were once a staple of his music.) That journey from outsider to ultimate cultural insider has been traversed by hip-hop, too; Flavor Flav of Public Enemy has also been a popular figure at these Games, if not at Snoop’s level.“He’s our lifestyle guru,” Neal said. “He’s like Uncle Stoner in a way that Willie Nelson wasn’t able to become for the mainstream. Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead never had that mainstream appeal, either.”He added: “I think we’re seeing something really fascinating and a kind of phenomenon with Snoop now.”And it’s a phenomenon that shows no sign of drifting away. Pin-trading is a well-established tradition at the Olympics, and one of this year’s hottest pins celebrates neither a country nor a sport. Instead, the pin features Snoop Dogg, exhaling Olympic rings of smoke.Another pin update, this time from Coco 😭 #olympics pic.twitter.com/remDy5FTTL"
WaPo_153,The NABJ wasn’t the audience Trump was aiming at,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/trump-harris-nabj-black-lies/,2024-08-01 06:38:02.749288,,"During his appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists on Wednesday, Donald Trump, as usual, played to the audience.It just wasn’t the audience in the room.Referring to Vice President Harris, Trump said, “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” It was ignorant. It was insulting. And it was a statement dripping with disdain and disrespect for the assembled Black journalists. Trump knew, and they knew that Trump knew, better. Trump was not speaking to them but to a MAGA audience beyond the Hilton Chicago that loves mocking people of color. He was having jaded fun. Think. “She happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” he said, sneeringly.As offensive as all that was to the Black men and women staring in his direction, Trump knew it was getting a belly laugh with his crowd, who can’t get enough of that stuff.In a Trump charade, facts don’t matter.Most of the NABJ audience knows the truth. That Harris is a daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother. That both of her parents immigrated to this country.Harris has said her mother raised her sister and her as Black because that’s how the world would see them.Harris has been dealing with that trope for years. “I’m Black, and I’m proud of being Black,” said the then-senator in a 2019 radio interview. “I was born Black. I will die Black, and I’m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don’t understand.”Harris embraced her identity. She elected to attend my alma mater, Howard University. She pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, a historically Black sorority. She and my wife, Gwen, are sorority sisters — a relationship they discovered four years ago when Harris brought her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to Washington. As an undergraduate, Harris became a Sweetheart of my fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi.Trump doesn’t know and probably doesn’t care that Sen. Kamala Harris was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.Lest anyone forget, Trump led the false, racist “birther” movement against President Barack Obama. And he tried the same thing against Harris when she was named Joe Biden’s running mate in 2020. President Trump said at a news conference, “I just heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements and by the way the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer.” The piece was a pile of junk, as were Trump’s grotesque hits on Harris’s heritage, then and now.And from the jeering audience in the room on Wednesday, he got the scornful reception he deserved."

WaPo_155,How false claims about a mass stabbing led to a riot in the U.K.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/southport-stabbing-riot-misinformation/,2024-08-01 06:56:02.749288,,"LONDON — In the aftermath, as they swept the streets of charred rubble and reassembled garden walls brick by brick, the residents of Southport tried to make sense of how their seaside town had become the setting of such unimaginable scenes this week.First the mass stabbings. Then the riot.On Monday, a yoga and dance workshop with a Taylor Swift theme, designed to occupy children on the first day of summer break, had ended with children running from the studio streaked with blood. Police arrested a suspect but said they didn’t yet understand the motive for the attack, which left three little girls dead and seven people in critical condition.By Tuesday night, violent protests had erupted in the streets. Rioters chanting “we want our country back” threw anything they could find at police, who had only helmets, batons and plastic shields to protect themselves. The rioters smashed the windows of a mosque and looted a shop. They set fire to trash cans, tires and a police van, which burned for hours, filling the skies with black smoke.Police blamed far-right extremists, who had been whipped up by false reports that an illegal immigrant had been responsible for the stabbings.Fifty-three officers were injured, eight seriously, along with three police dogs.The mosque’s imam told reporters afterward that he was cowering inside, afraid for his life. Things had always been so peaceful in his town, he said.The stabbings, and the ensuing riot, have been round-the-clock news in Britain. The violence has stunned the country.Although knife crime has been rising here, mass attacks are highly unusual. And although anger toward authorities and anti-migrant conspiracy theories have been part of British politics for sometime now, they have rarely exploded in this way.As police and witnesses have told it, the horror in Southport began shortly before lunchtime on Monday, when a man wearing a hoodie and a surgical mask arrived in a taxi and argued with the driver over his fare. The man ducked into the alley, then moved quickly to the dance studio. Soon neighbors said they heard screams.Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, have since died. Five other children remain in critical condition, along with a dance teacher.Jonathan Hayes, who runs the business next door and was stabbed in the leg while trying to help the children, told the BBC from his hospital bed that he was “saddened” he could not have done more.Police arrested a 17-year-old suspect on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Because of his age, his name has not been released by authorities. But he was born in Britain — in Cardiff, Wales — police stressed. The BBC and Financial Times reported that his parents were originally from Rwanda.Thousands of people came out for a vigil on Tuesday evening in Southport. In the crowd, couples held each other. Children were drawn closer. The mayor said, when placing flowers at the scene, “You couldn’t help but cry.” There was a minute of silence.Yet while flowers and stuffed animals piled up in an impromptu memorial outside the dance studio, false information about the suspect had been circulating online, amplified by prominent far-right figures.Within hours of the stabbings, an obscure social media account associated with an outlet calling itself Channel 3 Now News shared that the attacker was an immigrant who had come to Britain illegally by boat and had been on watch lists related to security and mental health. The post, on the X platform, gave a name for the suspect that police said was wrong.“It looks like the tweet has been deliberately fabricated to generate hostility toward ethnic minorities and immigrants, and it’s a potentially Islamophobic piece of propaganda,” said Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at the Loughborough University and expert in the spread of online misinformation.Even though the social media company tacked a “community note” to the original post, the claim went viral.According to X’s analytics, the post received at least 1.7 million views before it was deleted. Videos repeating the claim were shared by Andrew Tate, an American British former kickboxing champion who has built a popular personal brand around hypermasculinity, and Laurence Fox, an actor turned right-wing activist. Their posts received around 17 million views between them, according to X’s data.Chadwick said the claim spread quickly online for a combination of reasons: Emotions were high as people sought information in the aftermath of a gruesome attack, the claim was charged, and content restrictions on X have been loosened since the social media platform was acquired by Elon Musk in 2022.“We also know that historically social media algorithms are tweaked in order to further that content, because they know that it promotes engagement, and engagement over the long term is their business model,” he said.Last year, an analysis by The Washington Post found that Musk’s platform was amplifying hate speech in its “For You” timeline, an unintended side effect of an algorithm that is supposed to show users more of what they want.X, formerly Twitter, says in its user guidelines that hateful conduct, including attacking people on the basis of race, ethnicity or religious affiliation, is forbidden. A Post request for comment about the Southport case, sent to X’s main media email account, was met with an automated response: “Busy now, please check back later.”Whatever they had heard about the stabbings, the men in tracksuits who showed up in the hundreds in the streets of Southport later Tuesday night were seething with anger — and intent to take it out on authorities.Patrick Hurley, Southport’s member of Parliament, said the melee was carried out by “beered-up thugs” who were “using the horrific incident on Monday … for their own political purposes.”Police identified the rioters as supporters of the English Defence League (EDL), a now-disbanded organization of anti-Islam agitators and soccer hooligans, who still gather often in raw, sometimes violent protests.“There has been much speculation and hypothesis around the status of a 17-year-old male who is currently in police custody and some individuals are using this to bring violence and disorder to our streets,” police said in a statement.“It is sickening to see this happening within a community that has been devastated by the tragic loss of three young lives,” Alex Goss, assistant chief constable of the Merseyside Police, said in a statement Tuesday. “Our officers and other members of the emergency services were faced with one of the most difficult situations they will ever face. Tonight, they find themselves being attacked as they endeavor to prevent disorder.”The former de facto leader of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, issued denials on social media, writing, “There’s has been no EDL for over a decade.” But in a video seen more than 3 million times since he posted it on Tuesday around 9 p.m., he argued that “anger is justified” in Southport, because the British authorities have “opened our borders,” resulting in “children being butchered and murdered.”“You care more for Afghanis, Somalis, Eritreans, Syrians, Pakistanis,” he shouted, red-faced. “They’re a danger to us.”(Robinson’s whereabouts are unknown since he fled Britain on Sunday night, on the eve of unrelated contempt-of-court proceedings.)According to the Liverpool Echo news website, Jenni Stancombe, the mother of one of the slain girls, wrote on social media, “This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.”Police said Wednesday that they had detained five men — three of them from Southport — after the riot and that further investigation was underway.They are bracing for more violence."
WaPo_156,The anti-doping fight isn’t about whom to believe. It’s about transparency.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/wada-usada-chinese-swimmers-doping-allegations/,2024-08-01 06:00:02.749288,,"PARIS — A year ago, a Czech cyclist training in the United States tested positive for a banned substance that entered her system because she was handling a prescription medicine for her dying dog. Anti-doping authorities announced the results of the test — just as they announced there would be no penalty.Also last year, an American sprinter borrowed training sleeves from a friend to wear over an injured hamstring. The sleeves contained a banned substance. After an investigation concluded the sprinter shouldn’t be penalized, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the positive test anyway.In 2020, an American boxer tested positive for two banned substances that her partner was taking. An investigation determined the drugs entered her system through sex. She was exonerated in time to compete in the Tokyo Olympics the following summer. The positive tests still were disclosed.“As it stands, the WADA rules dictate that even if a positive test is proven to be caused by contamination, national anti-doping agencies must find a violation, disqualify results, and make a public announcement,” USADA CEO Travis Tygart said in a statement issued Tuesday night.Which gets us to the Paris Olympics. And the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for banned substances three years ago. And the results that weren’t announced.There is all-out war between two agencies that are supposed to pull on the same end of the rope. It’s not going away. If anything, it’s escalating.“The politicization of Chinese swimming continues with this latest attempt by the media in the United States to imply wrongdoing on the part of WADA and the broader anti-doping community,” WADA said in a lengthy statement Tuesday. “As we have seen over recent months, WADA has been unfairly caught in the middle of geopolitical tensions between superpowers but has no mandate to participate in that.”You gotta feel sorry for them, don’t you?The story has not stopped the Olympic swim meet in its tracks, not hardly. That’s because the Chinese swimmers have been held largely at bay. After winning 10 golds in Tokyo — second behind the United States’ 12 — and 20 medals overall, China has one gold, delivered Wednesday night with a world record in the men’s 100-meter freestyle from Pan Zhanle, to go with two silvers and two bronzes here as the meet reaches its midpoint. Zhanle’s performance led to the Chinese anthem filling Paris La Défense Arena for the first time.On Tuesday night, Qin Haiyang — the reigning world champion in the men’s 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes — failed to reach the final of the latter event, in which he holds the world record. This after he finished seventh in the 100 earlier in the meet. Wednesday morning, Xu Jiayu, who won one of China’s silvers in the 100 backstroke, failed to even show up for his heat in the 200 back. No immediate reason was given.It’s dangerous to consider those results and actions and conclude, “The Chinese must be missing something they relied on in Tokyo.” But WADA’s combination of inaction and secrecy has only bolstered such speculation.Forget the “politicization of Chinese swimming.” This is a mess of WADA’s own making. And it’s important to clean it up — not just for the Paris Games but for faith in the global system to ensure clean international competition going forward.The American media WADA refers to is the New York Times, which reported earlier Tuesday that two more Chinese swimmers had tested positive for banned substances — in this case, a hardcore steroid — but blamed it on contaminated meat. (One of those swimmers is on the Olympic team here.) But it also could and should include German outlet ARD, which with the Times reported in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine leading up to the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and that Chinese anti-doping authorities blamed on contamination in a hotel kitchen, an explanation that WADA accepted but didn’t announce. Last week, ARD further reported that those swimmers didn’t all stay at the same hotel.“A fundamental question at the heart of any claimed contamination case, which WADA refuses to answer in these cases, is what was the source of the positives?” Tygart’s latest statement said. “The fact that WADA accepted these excuses and declined to enforce its own rules is a failure of the system.”All this led to saber-rattling across the Atlantic. On Tuesday, a bipartisan congressional delegation announced legislation that would withhold the United States’ contribution to WADA’s budget — a $3.4 million contribution to a roughly $50 million annual budget.The swept-under-the-rug Chinese positives could make WADA seem toothless. And to the athletes who swam in Tokyo and are competing here against 11 of those swimmers, it is — regardless of China’s poor performance in the pool thus far.But tell that to the scores of athletes WADA has suspended over the years, even those who have claimed inadvertent ingestion. There’s Shelby Houlihan, the American record-holder in the women’s 1,500 meters who is missing her second Olympics after a positive test for the steroid nandrolone — that she blamed on a tainted burrito. There’s Issam Asinga, the Surinamese sprinter who set American high school records but is serving a four-year ban after testing positive for the banned substance GW1516, which alters how the body metabolizes fat. Asinga is suing Gatorade, which he says supplied him tainted gummies that were supposed to help with recovery.Whether you believe Houlihan or Asinga, they’re not here because WADA said they can’t be.“I just think this idea that somehow they’re soft on doping is unfair,” said Paul Greene, an American attorney who has represented athletes in doping cases for two decades. “I know from my years and years of dealing with them, if anything, they’re rigid.”What they are is inconsistent, and the reaction — particularly in the United States or from American athletes and observers — risks being horribly xenophobic. You can’t say, “Poor kid from Suriname; he should be here,” and follow it reflexively with, “We’re not going to fund you unless you suspend the Chinese.”But WADA also needs to admit that it didn’t handle the China cases properly. Beyond that, WADA and the International Olympic Committee need to understand that the timing of the unpublicized positives — less than a year in advance of the Beijing Winter Games — makes the optics awful, quietly clearing athletes from one of the few countries eager to host future Olympics.Beyond that, the IOC must understand the threats it is making to yank the 2034 Winter Games from Salt Lake City unless Americans bow to WADA as the “supreme authority” on all things doping are laughable. Where else would they turn? Beyond that, WADA must come to the conclusion that its blended relationship with the IOC — half of the budget comes from countries around the world, the other half from the IOC — cripples its ability to police doping as an independent agency.American outcry is not the reason WADA’s structure is flawed and its actions open to suspicion. Both problems are solvable, but only if both the IOC and WADA understand that public perception matters when it comes to faith. And without faith in the system, who can be confident the competition is clean?"
WaPo_157,"Trump issues many, many falsehoods at Black journalists’ convention",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/31/trump-issues-many-many-falsehoods-black-journalists-convention/,2024-08-01 07:41:02.744911,,"“You know, nobody died that day, you do know that? But people died in Seattle. Nobody died, but people died in Minneapolis. You know, people died in Minneapolis, and nothing happens. And nobody ever talks and nothing happens to those people. But you went after the J6 people with a vengeance.”— Donald Trump, in a conversation at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, July 31In his half-hour sit-down with three journalists at NABJ, the former president and Republican presidential nominee unleashed his usual litany of falsehoods, ranging from a phony story about the ex-governor of Virginia executing a baby after birth to an absurd claim that he “saved” historically Black colleges and universities. To a Black audience, he yet again bragged he did more for Blacks than any president since Abraham Lincoln — earning the instant rejoinder (which he ignored) from ABC News’ Rachel Scott: “Better than President Johnson, who signed the Voting Rights Act?”Rather than repeat ourselves, we have provided links to previous fact checks at the end of this report.Instead we will focus on a fresh claim he made. When asked about pardoning people convicted of violence during the Jan. 6 attacks — he said he would — he resorted to whataboutism. He asserted that people died in Seattle and Minneapolis during the social justice protests after the death of George Floyd in 2020 — and nothing happened to those people.As part of his argument, Trump falsely claimed that “nobody died.” A Senate report said that “seven individuals, including three law enforcement officers, ultimately lost their lives” in connection with the attack, four of them “that day.” Four were Trump supporters — one shot by a U.S. Capitol police officer as she tried to climb through a broken window that led to the Speaker’s Lobby, two of heart attacks and one from amphetamine intoxication. Brian D. Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, collapsed at his desk after the attack and died a day later. The District’s chief medical examiner concluded that Sicknick had suffered two strokes nearly eight hours after being sprayed with a chemical irritant. Two other officers committed suicide within days of the attack.Trump also claimed that just a few days ago there was a “horrible attack on the Capitol” by pro-Palestinian protesters — and “they fought with them much more openly than I saw on January 6th.” That’s not true. “Though most demonstrators walked and chanted peacefully, there were some clashes with law enforcement, and D.C. police and Capitol Police said they arrested 15 people in total. The U.S. Park Police arrested eight people,” The Washington Post reported. Trump spoke at length about the tragedy of “incredible monuments, bells, lions, all these magnificent limestone and granite with red paint.” The vandalism took place not at the Capitol but near Union Station — appearing on the Christopher Columbus memorial fountain and Freedom Bell, a reproduction of the Liberty Bell — and National Park Service officials said they would be cleaned within three days, despite Trump’s saying of the defacement: “You’ll see it in a hundred years from now.”An American flag was also burned, earning condemnation from Trump’s rival for the presidency, vice president Kamala Harris.Here’s what happened in Seattle and Minneapolis. The information on deaths during the protests came from Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a nonprofit. The organization found that the overwhelming majority of the 9,000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations were peaceful, but that 11 people were killed while participating in the protests and an additional 14 died in incidents linked to them.SeattleTwo people were killed, according to ACLED. Summer Taylor, a Black Lives Matter activist, died when a car rammed into the protests. Another person, 16-year-old Antonio Mays Jr., was shot in an incident that ACLED said was tied to the broader unrest. (Another fatal shooting of a teen was not connected, ACLED concluded.)Dawit Kelete, 30, who drove into the protest on July 4, 2020, killing Taylor and seriously injuring another person, was sentenced to 78 months in jail. The judge said that while there was no evidence he hit the protesters intentionally, his conduct was “extremely reckless.”Mays died in the early morning hours of June 29, 2020, while driving a stolen Jeep in Seattle’s Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone, which protesters occupied for three weeks after police abandoned the area. Mays lived in San Diego, but traveled to Seattle to be part of history, his family said. The incident led the city to shut down the protest zone.No one has been charged in Mays’s death. Mays’s father has filed a wrongful-death suit against the city for allowing “lawlessness to reign.”MinneapolisOne person was killed, according to ACLED. The Max It Pawn Shop was set on fire during protests on May 28, 2020, and then two months later, police discovered a charred body in the wreckage. Surveillance video footage showed Montez Terriel Lee, 26, pouring an accelerant around the pawnshop and lighting it on fire. Lee was sentenced to 10 years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, the Justice Department said.These are among the false claims Trump made at the Chicago event, in the order in which he made them, with links to earlier fact checks of them.Is there any doubt?(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"
WaPo_158,"Katie Ledecky, one of the oldest U.S. swimmers, has a golden senior moment",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/31/katie-ledecky-olympic-gold-medal/,2024-08-01 07:22:02.744911,,"NANTERRE, France — Down and back she went — 50 meters at a time, 30 times in all. In the pool, Katie Ledecky is the model of consistency. From lap to lap and from Olympics to Olympics.She was once the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic team. She won gold then, an unassuming, cheery 15-year-old in London, introducing herself to the world.Twelve years later, she’s among the oldest American swimmers in Paris at age 27. No introductions needed. She’s still winning, of course, and her name is known across this planet and probably also on some neighboring ones.Her dominant win in the women’s 1,500-meter freestyle Wednesday night was among the easiest sure-thing, can’t-miss, bet-the-house locks of these Olympics. She won gold at Paris La Défense Arena, her first of these Summer Games, finishing more than 10 seconds ahead of the field. She successfully defended her Olympic title and lowered her Olympic record in one of her signature races.“It’s not easy,” she said. “It doesn’t get any easier. I do try to enjoy it each year. There’s different perspective that I have different years, and different challenges that you face each year in training and as you get older.”Ledecky has lowered the world record in the 1,500 six times and has now turned in the 20 fastest races the event has ever seen. Wednesday’s winning time of 15 minutes 30.02 seconds was well short of the world record she set in 2018 (15:20.48), but still more than seven seconds faster than her time from the U.S. trials last month (15:37.35).It’s Ledecky’s eighth career gold, spanning four Olympic Games, tying the Bethesda, Md., native with fellow American Jenny Thompson for the most by a female swimmer. And it’s her 12th Olympic medal of any color, which draws her even with Thompson, fellow Americans Dara Torres, Natalie Coughlin and Australian Emma McKeon for the most by a female swimmer.“I try not to think about history very much or any of that,” Ledecky said. “But I know those names, those people that I’m up with. They’re swimmers that I looked up to when I first started swimming. It’s an honor to just be named among them.”She’ll have two chances to pull in front of that talented pack. Ledecky, who took bronze in the 400 free Saturday, swims the 4x200 freestyle relay Thursday and then closes her Paris meet with the 800 free, with semifinals scheduled for Friday and the final on Saturday.When Ledecky saw her winning time Wednesday, uncharacteristically, her emotions got the best of her. She pounded the pool surface with her right arm, as she splashed her name across more pages of the Olympic record book.It was the eighth-fastest 1,500 time ever and Ledecky’s fastest in more than a year. When she left the pool, she pumped her fist and raised both arms into the air.“It’s never easy to win a gold medal,” she said, “so just trying to soak in every moment of it.”Her win was part of an especially busy and memorable night at the pool. France’s Léon Marchand lit up the crowd, winning two gold medals and setting Olympic records in both the 200 butterfly and the 200 breaststroke. China’s Pan Zhanle broke the first world record of this Paris meet, smashing his own mark in the 100 free by 0.40 seconds with a time of 46.40. And Sweden’s Sarah Sjoestroem, swimming in her fifth Olympics, won her first gold in the 100 free, out-touching American Torri Huske at the wall. Huske took silver, her third medal of these Games.For Ledecky, the excitement started stirring before she set foot on the pool deck. She watched that women’s 100 free that kicked off the night and said she got fired up watching Huske sprint to the wall. Three days after taking gold in the 100 butterfly, the 21-year-old Arlington, Va., native was pleased with her race, finishing with a time of 52.29 seconds, just 0.13 seconds behind the 30-year-old Swede.“As proud as I am of my 100 fly, I am equally as proud of my 100 free,” Huske said. “After semis, I realized everyone was so close and it was anyone’s game. I love to race and I think the competition brought out the best in me.”Ledecky would enter her race with decidedly different expectations. She hadn’t lost a 1,500-meter race in more than 14 years; she’s nearly dried off by the time her competitors hit the wall for the final time.The women’s 1,500 meters, which made its Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games, is unlike any other on the Paris program. It requires discipline, dedication, persistence and tends to grind up lesser athletes. It’s not the type of race that elite swimmers choose to stick with for years, but it will go down as a key part of Ledecky’s legacy, an event that illustrates more than any other how dominate a long-distance freestyler she is.She’s as reliable as a metronome, her strokes — more than 1,200 of them throughout the race — rhythmic and melodic and powerful. Once she built a comfortable lead over the first 300 meters Wednesday, Ledecky settled into a steady pace. Her next 23 50-meter split times all fell between 31.10 and 31.69 seconds.She led Anastasiia Kirpichnikova, the Russian-born French swimmer, by a car length early. Then by a bus. Then an 18-wheeler. Ledecky had a nearly five-second advantage at the halfway mark and just kept pushing. By the final lap, she was several train cars of Kirpichnikova and the rest of the field.As Ledecky made her way back and forth, she thought about her training at the University of Florida. She left Stanford following the Tokyo Games, relocated to Gainesville, Fla., and began working with Coach Anthony Nesty and his group of talented male freestylers. Ledecky passed the time in the pool repeating the names of the teammates who pushed her these past three years over and over, guys like Bobby Finke and Kieran Smith, fellow Olympians both of them.“I know I make their lives hard some days, but they made my life a lot easier today,” she said with a laugh.On the medal podium later, Ledecky sported a big, toothy smile, with her hair tucked behind her ears. On the surface, the scene and the happy young champion sure didn’t look different than 2012. To be sure, plenty has changed. Back then, no one expected her to win gold.“Of course, coming into tonight, I expected it of myself,” she said. “I know a lot of other people expected it of me. And that doesn’t make it easy. It’s not easy to always follow through and get the job done. There’s moments of doubt, hard days of training where you doubt yourself. You just have to push through and trust your training. Trust that everything will come together in the end. I’m glad that it did today.”"
WaPo_159,Accused 9/11 plotters reach plea deals with U.S. to avoid death penalties,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/31/sept-11-case-plea-agreement/,2024-08-01 07:15:02.744911,,"The man accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and two of his co-defendants have reached plea agreements that will allow them to avoid the death penalty, the Defense Department announced Wednesday — a dramatic development in the decades-long case for the prisoners at the U.S. military detention facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi will all plead guilty, according to a letter sent to families of the victims by a senior U.S. defense official overseeing the cases. A panel of military officials eventually will determine the men’s sentences.“In exchange for the removal of the death penalty as a possible punishment, these three accused have agreed to plead guilty to all of the charged offenses, including the murder of the 2,976 people listed in the charge sheet, and to be later sentenced by a panel of military officers,” according to the letter, signed by Rear Adm. Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor in the case.The deals raise the prospect that some of the most significant cases in the Pentagon’s long legal process stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks may finally be over. Human rights organizations and legal experts have both criticized the proceedings for their secretive nature, conflicts of interest, and repeated delays that have drawn out the effort for years.The process also has been complicated in part by a 2015 law passed by Congress that restricted the U.S. government from allowing detainees at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay to set foot in the continental United States, even for their criminal trials. Lawmakers did so while citing security concerns, even as the Justice Department has continued to try other terrorism suspects in federal court.The cases also have been complicated by the brutal nature in which the United States detained, and interrogated individuals involved.“At the heart of the commissions’ problems is their original sin, torture,” John G. Baker, a Marine Corps general who served as defense counsel of the Military Commissions Defense Organization, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2021. “The United States chose to secretly detain and torture the men it now seeks to punish.”The five defendants were initially charged in 2008, but the cases were dropped in 2010 as the Obama administration sought to try them instead in New York. Military officials refiled charges against all five men in 2011, as the Obama administration shifted gears after failing to close the Guantánamo Bay detention center.“After 13 years of pretrial litigation this agreement was a critical step toward judicial finality,” said James G. Connell, III, attorney for Ammar al-Baluchi, another 9/11 defendant at Guantánamo who is not covered by the deal. Negotiations are still ongoing in his case.“They finally got around to recognizing the inevitable — that they were never going to get to a capital sentence,’’ said Gary Brown, who was the legal adviser to the convening authority from 2017 to 2018, Harvey Rishikof. “And it’s time to bring the commissions to a close.”Rishikof and Brown were in the process of negotiating guilty pleas for the 9/11 defendants in exchange for life sentences when they were fired by Pentagon officials, allegedly for mismanagement. Brown has subsequently settled a whistleblower reprisal case, whose terms are confidential.“The plea deal with life imprisonment is the most appropriate resolution for this case” because of legal structural problems that made a death penalty conviction hard to sustain by an appellate court, Rishikof said. Those legal problems, he said, included the fact that the defense counsel was given access to only summaries of classified evidence, and that waterboarding of the defendants tainted any admissions of guilt.Dan Lamothe and Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report."
WaPo_160,Maduro urges Venezuelans to report protesters who question his reelection,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/venezuela-election-maduro-protest-crackdown/,2024-08-01 07:01:02.744911,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Government security forces are detaining volunteer poll watchers who monitored the presidential election here Sunday, opposition leaders said, and President Nicolás Maduro is encouraging Venezuelans to report protesters who dispute the claim that he won.More than 1,000 people have been arrested and at least 16 have been killed in mass protests since the election, government officials and civil society groups said Wednesday, as Venezuelans continued to question the reelection of the authoritarian socialist.Maduro’s electoral council says he defeated challenger Edmundo González by 7 percentage points to win six more years in office, but has refused to publish voting data to support the claim.Independent exit polling, an analysis of results from a sample of voting centers and, the opposition says, the government’s own records show González captured twice as many votes as Maduro. Maduro claimed on Wednesday that the opposition had hacked the country’s voting system.U.S. officials, meanwhile, demanded Maduro release the data.The Biden administration’s “patience and that of the international community is running out on waiting for the Venezuelan electoral authorities to come clean and release the full, detailed data on this election,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby warned Wednesday. The United States, he told reporters, condemns “political violence and repression of any kind.”“We have serious concerns about the reports of casualties, violence and arrests, including the arrest warrants that Maduro and his representatives issued today for opposition leaders,” he said. “Alongside the international community, we’re watching and we’re going to respond accordingly.”In the coastal state of Vargas, opposition leaders said, the crackdown against poll watchers began soon after Sunday’s election. Security forces have detained multiple people, the opposition’s chief campaign organizer in Vargas said, and many more have fled their homes in fear.“These poll watchers played a key and fundamental role on the July 28 elections,” José Rafael Rolón Cedeño told The Washington Post. “It was them who defended the physical voting tallies, which in turn helped us defend democracy in Venezuela. They were the ones that gave us the evidence that we had won. That’s why the government is attacking” them.Jesús Armas, an opposition campaign organizer in Caracas, said security forces and the Maduro-supporting bikers known as colectivos appear to be targeting low-income areas that have previously been strongholds of government support.“They’ve arrested poll watchers for being in protests and organizing protests,” Armas told The Post. “But we’ve also seen that poll watchers are targeted because, in many cases, they’re community leaders. So it’s not only that they served as poll watchers, but also that they’re mobilizing people and are the heads of their communities.“The government’s goal, it seems, is to squash any protest — especially in the areas that were once their bastions of power.”Foro Penal, a rights group that has been tracking arrests, injuries and deaths in the aftermath of the election, said it could not confirm that poll watchers were being targeted.“We don’t have that radar,” said Gonzalo Himiob, the group’s director. “What we have are detained opposition leaders, opposition mayors and people who were in the protests or, even without protesting, in the surrounding areas.”The government has also taken the crackdown into cyberspace. Speaking from the balcony of the Miraflores presidential palace on Tuesday, Maduro urged Venezuelans to report protesters on the government application VenApp. His government launched it in 2022 to receive reports of power outages and medical emergencies.“We’re opening a new page in the app for all the Venezuelan population, so they can confidentially give me all the information about the delinquents who have threatened the people — attacked the people — so we can go after them and bring them to prompt justice,” Maduro said.When the app was created, human rights advocates warned that it could be repurposed.“We are watching the technology being used as a weapon of political persecution,” said Luis Serrano, coordinator of the rights group RedesAyuda. “Here in Venezuela, peaceful protest is not a crime. What is dangerous and outside the law is that people take a picture of their neighbors and share it with authorities only for participating in a protest.”The government also launched the Telegram channel “Hunting Guarimbas” — the word refers to blocking roads in protest — where it’s posting photos and videos of protesters and asking users to identify them.Social media was flooded with complaints about VenApp, and by Wednesday, it did not appear to be available in either the Apple or Google app stores.A spokesperson for Google said the company pulled the app Wednesday afternoon after determining it violated its policies against bullying and harassment. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.Opposition leaders said Wednesday that security forces had surrounded the Argentine Embassy in Caracas, where six opposition campaign staffers have been holed up since arrest warrants were issued against them in December. The embassy’s power was cut off. Argentine President Javier Milei, who has questioned Maduro’s election victory, denounced what he called a “deliberate action that endangers the safety of Argentine diplomatic personnel and Venezuelan citizens under protection.”The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela called on X for an end to the “threats and persecution” against the campaign staffers and for “the immediate approval of their safe passage.”Paúl reported from Washington."

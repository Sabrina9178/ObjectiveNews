NBC_1,Election 2024 live updates: Harris' veepstakes heats up; Trump lobs 'border czar' attacks,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-harris-presidential-election-live-updates-rcna164000,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"Megan Lebowitz
Harris’ favorability rating among adults now stands at 43%, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released yesterday.
The same group found that Harris’ favorability rating was at 35% the week earlier. The change in her favorability is outside of the poll’s margin of error.
A New York Times/Siena College poll released last week found that Harris and Trump are in a tight race, with Trump polling at 48% and Harris at 47% among likely voters. Those numbers are within the poll’s margin of error.

Harris is on track to become just the second female major-party presidential nominee. But further down the ballot, the number of women jumping into congressional races is down this year after hitting record highs in 2020 and 2022.
The trend tracks against a surge in female voter registration following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which returned abortion policy to the states in 2022. And despite the decline, the totals are still higher than they ever were before 2018, when hundreds more women than ever ran for the House of Representatives in the midterm elections during the Trump administration.

Trump spent much of his Minnesota rally dinging Biden — even though he’s no longer Trump’s 2024 opponent.
The rally often mirrored his campaign events from before the assassination attempt and the start of Harris’ campaign.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, Trump mocked Biden’s golf game, cognitive ability and performance at events. He criticized his former opponent’s son Hunter Biden and called the president names. Trump ridiculed how Biden walked, meandering about the stage in an effort to depict Biden being unable to exit an event.
Even as he pivoted to attack Harris, Trump himself seemed to allude to the constants that have persisted over the past month, despite the seismic shake-ups in the 2024 race. The former president discussed the assassination attempt at his rally in Pennsylvania, a life-or-death experience that could be transformational for many. But Trump said he hasn’t changed since the attempt on his life.
“They all say, ‘I think he’s changed. I think he’s changed since two weeks ago. Something affected him,’” Trump said, referring to the assassination attempt. “No, I haven’t changed. Maybe I’ve gotten worse, actually, because I get angry at the incompetence that I witness every single day, the way millions of people are pouring into our country.”

NBC_2,Quad foreign ministers decry dangerous South China Sea actions,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/quad-foreign-ministers-decry-dangerous-south-china-sea-actions-rcna164017,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"TOKYO — Foreign ministers from Australia, India, Japan and the United States said Monday that they were seriously concerned about intimidating and dangerous maneuvers in the South China Sea and pledged to bolster maritime security in the region.
The joint statement came after talks among the so-called Quad countries in Tokyo, attended by Australia’s Penny Wong, India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Japan’s Yoko Kamikawa and Antony Blinken from the U.S.
In security talks between the U.S. and Japan on Sunday, the two allies labeled China the “greatest strategic challenge, facing the region.
“We are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” the ministers said in the statement, which did not directly mention China.
They also expressed serious concern about the militarization of disputed features and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea, including dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels.
Asked about the statement at a regular news briefing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the Quad was “artificially creating tension, inciting confrontation and containing the development of other countries.”
Chinese vessels have repeatedly clashed with Philippine ships seeking to resupply its troops on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal in recent months, although the two countries in July reached a provisional agreement that aims to ease tensions.
The Quad group said they were working on a series of initiatives to maintain “the free and open maritime order” including helping partners improve domain awareness via satellite data, training and capacity building. They also announced a plan to set up a new maritime legal dialogue.
“We are charting a course for a more secure and open Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean region by bolstering maritime security,” Blinken said in remarks to reporters after the meeting.
“In practical terms what does this mean? It means strengthening the capacity of partners across the region to know what’s happening in their own waters,” he added.
He said the U.S. would continue to work with its partners to ensure freedom of navigation and the unimpeded flow of lawful maritime commerce.
The U.S. announced plans on Sunday for a major revamp of its military command in Japan. It was among several measures announced by the allies to address what they said was an “evolving security environment,” noting various threats from China including its muscular maritime activities.
“Uncertainty surrounding the international order as well as the international situation has been increasing with Russia continuing its aggression in Ukraine, attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East China Sea and South China Sea, and the launch of ballistic missiles by North Korea,” Japan’s Kamikawa said after the talks.
The Quad ministers also pledged to advance cooperation in cybersecurity to protect supply chains and critical infrastructure, including undersea cables.
After leaving Tokyo, Blinken and Austin will hold security talks with another Asian ally, the Philippines, as the Biden administration seeks to counter an increasingly bold China.Reuters"
NBC_3,Mark Meadows asks Supreme Court to intervene in his Georgia election interference case,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/mark-meadows-asks-supreme-court-intervene-georgia-election-interferenc-rcna164023,2024-07-29 22:00:02.991095,,"Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has asked the Supreme Court to move his Georgia election interference case to federal court, citing the high court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity.
“It is hard to imagine a case in which the need for a federal forum is more pressing than one that requires resolving novel questions about the duties and powers of one of the most important federal offices in the Nation,” Meadows’ lawyers wrote in a petition to the Supreme Court dated Friday.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year rejected Meadows’ bid to move his Georgia case to a federal court, saying that Meadows failed to show that his actions at the heart of the indictment were part of his official White House duties.
In their petition to the Supreme Court, Meadows’ lawyers argue that the appellate decision was “egregiously wrong, wholly unprecedented, and exceptionally dangerous,” arguing that the high court's ruling this month on the former president's immunity for official acts is grounds for the court to intervene in Meadows' Georgia election case.
“That decision makes clear that federal immunity fully protects former officers, often requires difficult and fact-intensive judgment calls at the margins, and provides not just a substantive immunity but a use immunity that protects against the use of official acts to try to hold a current or former federal officer liable for unofficial acts,” they wrote. “All of those sensitive disputes plainly belong in federal court.”
Trump, Meadows and 17 other defendants were indicted last year on felony charges in connection with alleged schemes to overturn Trump’s loss in Georgia in the 2020 election. 
Meadows faces two counts in the 41-count indictment, including charges of violating the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer. He has pleaded not guilty.Summer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News."
NBC_4,Trump agrees to give a victim interview to the FBI after assassination attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-agrees-give-victim-interview-fbi-assassination-attempt-rcna164006,2024-07-29 23:30:02.902718,,"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump has agreed to participate in a victim interview with the FBI focused on his attempted assassination, a bureau official told reporters Monday.
The interview with Trump would be consistent with any interview the bureau would conduct for any victim of crime under any circumstances, an official said.
The FBI investigation has found that attempted assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks was a ""highly intelligent"" man as well as ""a loner"" with few friends and acquaintances outside of his family, and had a growing interest in weapons.
His motive is still not known. The FBI has conducted hundreds of interviews and requested information about his online accounts, including gaming accounts, from dozens of companies, an official said. His search history included seeking information about the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico earlier this year, as well as mass shootings and power plants, an official said. Last week, the FBI revealed that Crooks had searched ""how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?"" about the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, about a week before the attack.
The FBI found that the ladder Crooks purchased before the shooting was not taken to the Trump rally, though officials found a bloodied receipt for it on his body. Crooks did appear to have used a drone ahead of the attack, although no recorded footage was found on the drone, the FBI said.
Crooks fired off eight rounds just 25-30 seconds after a local police officer attempted to confront him on the roof. As NBC News has previously reported, citing the FBI and law enforcement, the officer was boosted up above the roof line by a colleague and Crooks pointed his weapon at the officer just before firing.
Crooks appeared to have carefully planned the attack ahead of the campaign rally and worked to keep his plans quiet, an official said during a briefing for reporters Monday, more than two weeks after the July 13 attempt on Trump's life.
FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said Monday that the bureau had been working around the clock on the investigation and that while the bureau typically does not share regular updates about ongoing investigations, FBI officials felt doing so here was important for the American public.
U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week in the wake of the attack and after a contentious House hearing about the attempt. The Senate will conduct its own hearing this week with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.
Abbate said the bureau was collecting facts but was not focused on identifying failures by law enforcement that day, saying that type of analysis was better left to others.
“The entirety of the FBI is committed to uncovering the real facts, the truth about this attack on former President Trump and the murder of Mr. Comperatore and the injury to others as well,” Abbate said, referring to Corey Comperatore, a rallygoer who was killed in the attack. Two others were wounded.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress last week that “there’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel” that hit Trump’s ear during the assassination attempt, adding fuel to conspiracy theories about the shooting.
FBI Agent Kevin Rojek, who runs the Pittsburgh office, said Monday that Trump was struck with a bullet, whether it be a whole or fragmented bullet, echoing a statement from the bureau issued Friday after Wray’s congressional testimony.
Rojek said that Crooks appeared to have ""made significant efforts to conceal his activities.""
Rojek said Crooks appeared to be ""a loner,"" and another official said there was no indication that Crooks had any mental health treatment or institutionalization.
The FBI has had difficulty getting into some of Crooks' accounts because of his use of encrypted apps, a bureau official said.
""Encryption has been a challenge for us here in this investigation,"" said FBI official Bobby Wells.Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News."
NBC_5,U.S. soccer stars Tobin Heath and Christen Press reveal they’ve been a couple for 8 years,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/soccer-stars-tobin-heath-christen-press-couple-8-years-rcna164102,2024-07-30 00:24:02.956940,,"After years of fan speculation, Tobin Heath and Christen Press confirmed they have been in a relationship for the past eight years.
The U.S. soccer stars opened up about their romance during Sunday's episode of the “Watch with Alex Cooper” Olympics show on Peacock. 
“Tobin and I were not really friends. We weren’t really running in the same circles. And then as soon as I actually got to know her, there was just, like, a magnetism,” said Press, recalling the early days of her relationship with Heath. “And I was like, that’s what I want. And I never looked back. I still feel the exact same way.”
“The other day, someone just said to us, ‘Oh, you guys, these guys just met, you look like you’re in love,’” Press continued. “And I’m like, ‘No, it’s been eight years.’”
Heath also opened up about her joy and gratitude about their relationship.
“Sometimes we look at each other, we’re just like, is this actually like real? Are we that lucky?” she said.
Heath, 36, and Press, 35, both previously played on the U.S. women’s national soccer team. 
While they did not publicly confirm they were an item for several years, Press said the people close to them had long known about their relationship.
“Our teammates knew. … We were never, like, in the closet, like hiding it. Our people always knew what was going on with us,” she said. 
However, especially while they were playing on the same team, Heath said they wanted to keep a “protective bubble” around their romance. This began to shift once they were no longer teammates on the U.S. national team.
“It wasn’t until we kind of weren’t playing on the same team that it was a little bit easier for us to come forward and kind of share our relationship a little bit,” Press said.
It’s unclear exactly when Heath and Press first met, but it appears to have been around when Press joined the U.S. national team.
Press was named as an alternate forward for Team USA at the 2012 London Olympics, while Heath was a midfielder.
Heath talked about what first drew her to Press during their recent interview with Alex Cooper.
“She’s really good at scoring goals. I wasn’t that good at scoring goals. I thought I could learn a little something,” she joked.
Heath opened up more about her first impressions of Press during a recent episode of their “The RE-CAP Show with Tobin Heath and Christen Press” podcast.
“I thought you were a little bit of a mystery,” Heath said. “I feel like you were a little detached from the group, and I think I was like a little curious to who you were.
“There are so many big personalities on the team … but for you, the way that you came onto the team I feel like was very kind of under the radar,” she added. “And I think I was very curious. I was like, who is this chick?”
As Heath and Press shared in their recent interview with Cooper, they have been in a relationship for eight years — meaning they started dating circa 2016. 
They played together on the U.S. national team for several years before this.
They were often photographed celebrating victories together on the field with the rest of their teammates, including in 2013 during a friendly match in the Netherlands. 
Press and Heath were later both named to the national team squad for the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, which the U.S. ended up winning. 
In 2019, Press and Heath co-founded lifestyle brand RE-INC along with fellow soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Meghan Klingenberg.
The brand offers “eco-conscious fashion” and “creative goods” designed for “all gender identities and body types,” as well as a membership platform, according to the company’s website.
The pair also launched a podcast, the “RE-CAP Show,” in conjunction with their lifestyle brand, in which they discuss global soccer and women’s sports.
“We are teammates, roommates, co-CEOs,” Press said during their recent interview with Cooper. “We co-host our show. We pretty much co- everything, that’s kind of our jam.” 
“So it’s a good thing I love you,” she added with a laugh to Heath.
Both Press and Heath signed one-year contracts with the U.K.’s Manchester United Women’s team in 2020.
Heath had to step away from the club earlier than planned after sustaining an ankle injury, while Press completed the season, making 17 appearances and scoring four goals, according to ESPN. 
“Grateful for an incredible season at @manutdwomen,” Press wrote on Instagram in May 2021. “I learned so much playing alongside such a humble, ambitious, and hardworking group. You girls keep me young! GGMU!!”
Over the past few years, Heath and Press have been sharing loving posts about each other on social media, fueling relationship rumors.
In 2021, Press shared a selfie of her with her arm around Heath during a winter excursion.
In September 2023, Heath shared a photo of her and Press smiling, along with the caption, “You know you make my world light up.”
This April, Heath shared a photo of her and Press embracing in a field of yellow flowers with the caption, “The wild ones.”
And in May, Press posted a photo of herself cozying up to Heath in honor of her partner’s birthday.
“Didn’t have time for a birthday post because I was busy ensuring you had the best day ever. So…HBD+1 @tobinheath,” she wrote in the caption.
They have also been spotted holding hands a few times at public events.
They were photographed holding pinkies at the 2023 ESPY Awards in Los Angeles, and in December 2022, they stood hand in hand on the red carpet as they attended the Grassroot Soccer World AIDS Day Gala in New York City.

NBC_6,Who are the Druze? The minority sect on the fringe of the Israel-Hamas war,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/druze-minority-sect-israel-hamas-war-who-are-rcna164013,2024-07-30 00:00:02.956940,,"MAJDAL SHAMS, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed retaliation during a visit to the scene of a rocket strike that killed 12 young members of a minority Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
“Our response will come, and it will be hard,” he said as he met with civilian and military officials in the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights as fears grew that the incident, which Israeli officials blamed on rocket fire from Hezbollah, the powerful militant group in neighboring Lebanon, would push the region into a wider war. Hezbollah has denied it was behind the attack.
As the body of 11-year-old Guevara Ibrahim was carried through the streets, alongside pictures of the smiling boy, thousands of mourners took to the streets to pay tribute to the 12th victim of the strike that hit the soccer field. Some were dressed in traditional attire, wearing all black with white and red-topped turbans or white headscarves.
Twelve chairs covered with black cloth sat empty in the soccer field where the rocket hit. Elsewhere, abandoned children’s bicycles lay near a bomb shelter, which is a few feet away from the blast site but was out of reach for those caught off guard.
While the strike was the deadliest in Israel or in Israeli-controlled territory since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terror attack, according to Israeli officials, it hit a largely Druze community, which has a distinct place in the region. 
NBC News looks at who the Druze are, and what the Golan Heights is.
The deadly strike has cast a spotlight on the Druze community, a tight-knit sect, which dates back to the 11th century and draws from Christian, Muslim and Jewish beliefs, while incorporating elements of “Hinduism and even classical Greek Philosophy,” according to the Pew Research Center. 
A unique religious and ethnic group that does not allow converts, it draws on a variety of traditions for its liturgy, including a belief in reincarnation and a six-volume Book of Wisdom.
Today, the Druze population is made up of more than 1 million people living primarily in Syria and Lebanon, where some have achieved high political office, as well as in Israel and Jordan. 
There are approximately 150,000 members of the Druze community in Israel, according the latest figures from the country's Central Bureau of Statistics. 
Around 25,000 live in the Golan Heights — a rocky plateau overlooking the upper Jordan River valley on the west — which was seized by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967 before it was formally annexed in 1981. Israel subsequently offered them citizenship.
Syria has for decades demanded the return of the area, which sits around 40 miles southwest of the country’s capital, Damascus, and is still seen as occupied territory under international law and United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
After the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011,  a growing number of Druze in the Golan Heights have sought Israeli citizenship and roughly 25% of the community now hold it, according to Rami Zeedan, an associate professor of Israel studies at the University of Kansas, who is Druze himself.
Zeedan, who is also editor of the Druze Studies Journal, said that  some are “becoming more connected to Israeli society,” while others remain firmly rooted in their identities as Syrians.  
Unlike members of Israel's Arab community, most of whom are Muslim or Christian, Israeli Druze are not exempt from military conscription and a large number serve with the Israel Defense Forces. Druze who do not hold Israeli citizenship are not subject to mandatory service.
At least 10 Druze officers and soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, according Israel’s Haaretz newspaper, which reported that eight died in combat in Gaza and two others were killed in the north of the country, where cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah have occurred almost daily since the war in the Gaza Strip began in October.
Hezbollah has previously said it will stop attacking Israel if it ends its campaign in Gaza, where health officials say almost 40,000 people have been killed since Oct. 7, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage by Hamas, according to Israeli tallies.
It is unusual for the group to deny an attack, but the militant group has nonetheless denied responsibility for the strike in Majdal Shams. 
In a series of statements issued Saturday, Hezbollah did say it had struck nearby military targets in the Golan Heights. In one statement, it claimed to have used a Falaq-1 rocket, the same munition Israel says hit the soccer field. However, the timings of the Hezbollah statements do not neatly align with the strike. Hezbollah said the Falaq-1 rocket was fired at 5:20 p.m. local time, while the IDF says Majdal Shams was hit at 6:18 p.m.
Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo on Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was “every indication” that the rockets were from Hezbollah, adding that he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life.
With tensions rising, Monday saw a flurry of diplomatic activity ahead of anticipated Israeli retaliation.  
The State Department said Blinken in a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday “emphasized the importance of preventing escalation of the conflict and discussed efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to allow citizens on both sides of the border between Israel and Lebanon to return home.”  
In Britain, where the government said Friday that it was dropping its predecessor’s query of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) jurisdiction to issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a post on X that he had spoken with caretaker Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati “to express my concern at escalating tension.”
Their comments came after Turkish President Reccep Tayyip Erdoğan suggested Sunday during a meeting of his ruling AK Party that Turkey could enter Israel as it had done in the past in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuters reported. He did not expand on exactly what kind of action he was proposing. 
Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said his country condemned the targeting of civilians in any part of the world, but rejected the idea that Hezbollah would have intentionally targeted a civilian site.
He also stressed that a major attack by Israel in Lebanon would only further escalate hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah and risk the eruption of a broader war.
Within the Golan Heights, said Zeedan of the University of Kansas, the pervading response to Saturday’s strike from the Druze community appeared to be a call for calm. 
But, he said, they also wanted justice for the children killed.

NBC_7,'UnPrisoned' star Kerry Washington says her show's appeal is all in the family,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/unprisoned-hulu-series-insights-kerry-washington-delroy-lindo-rcna161009,2024-07-30 01:20:02.570163,,"Kerry Washington isn’t known for comedy, and neither is Delroy Lindo. But when their show “UnPrisoned” from Onyx Collective debuted on Hulu last year, it caught audiences’ attention.
In the show, Edwin Alexander (Lindo) becomes “unprisoned” after 17 years, re-enters society and tries to reconnect with his grown daughter Paige, a therapist who shares her life and work on social media, and his teenage grandson. The premise reads more drama than laughter. But Edwin’s struggle is one that affects a lot of people, Lindo said via Zoom.
“It resonates for people in such personal ways,” he said. “And that’s the beauty of doing this particular work on [the] prison [system].”
The jail population ages 55 and older rose 24% from 2020 to 2021, according to a 2023 Prison Policy Initiative analysis of census data from local jails across the country. With America’s aging prison population, Black men are more likely to be handed down long sentences in their early 20s and remain incarcerated into their 50s, according to the Urban Institute. So Edwin’s story is increasingly common.
The show’s foundation is a very personal one for creator Tracy McMillan, a former journalist, screenwriter, relationship expert and host of the unscripted OWN series “Family or Fiancé.” She grew up in Minneapolis, where the show is set, and her own father was in and out of prison for most of her childhood and a lot of her adult life.
Washington, who also produces the series and is known for her social justice and voting rights activism, said she got behind the show because of its potential to “challenge people’s notions and open people’s minds around” people returning from prison and “the particular challenges they face — and then also what it means to love a returning citizen and what it means to navigate the kind of ripple effects of having a family member or loved one who is in the system.”
To shape Edwin, the 71-year-old Lindo, whose many credits include “Malcolm X,” “The Harder They Fall” and “The Good Fight,” took a multifaceted approach, including speaking with McMillan’s own father.
“I met with Will, who’s since passed on — God rest his soul — a few times, and had some very, very in-depth, very informative conversations with him about his experience, his life,” Lindo said. He also met with several organizations that work with formerly incarcerated people and has consulted with Louis L. Reed, one of the consultants on “UnPrisoned,” who is also formerly incarcerated.
“So I gathered all of this information, gathered all of this data, and then put it in my own personal hopper,” Lindo said. “And that’s how I started coming up with who Edwin Alexander would be.”
In the first season, Paige, traumatized by her upbringing, isn’t keen on being disappointed by her father yet again and doesn’t welcome the prospect of him living with her and her son, Finn (Faly Rakotohavana), even though family support is a good way to ensure he can stay free.
Finn, however, is excited to have his grandfather — and more specifically a man — in his life. Throughout the season, which includes Edwin’s longtime flame Nadine (Brenda Strong), whom Paige dislikes, Paige’s foster sister Esti (Jee Young Han), her potential love interest Mal (Marque Richardson), who is also Edwin’s parole officer, and Paige’s inner child (Jordyn McIntosh), among others, “UnPrisoned” puts on full display all the issues around incarceration that Washington mentioned, plus provides some history lessons.
In the first season, Edwin heads to Alabama with Paige and Finn in search of his birth certificate so that he can apply for a driver’s license. The trip reveals more about how his early life experiences growing up in the Jim Crow South inform who he is today. It also exemplifies why so many older Black Americans can’t produce a birth certificate, which has kept many from voting. At the end of the season, the Alexander family is again in flux, with Edwin moving out following a huge disappointment involving his grandson that could have landed him back in prison.
At the beginning of the second season, the Alexanders go to family therapy with the intent of supporting Finn.
But the therapist is someone Page neither likes nor respects. Billing himself as a “family radical healing coach,” Murphy (John Stamos), with whom Paige has publicly clashed, has an in-your-face style of therapy that engages both Edwin and Finn and sets up many laughs. It also challenges each of them to take a deeper dive into who they are, take accountability for their own actions and not simply blame external forces. For Paige, this also means allowing Finn to stand on his own. Paige begins to address her tendency to turn away from good men like Mal. Finn tries to connect with his biological father and face his other fears, while Edwin tries to really take control of his life.
Regardless of their personal challenges, they are still family, which resonates most with “UnPrisoned” fans, Washington said.
“One of the things I think is so special about the show is this kind of intergenerational love,” she said. “And the show is, in some ways, about how Paige is a member of the ‘sandwich generation,’ where you’re taking care of your parents and you’re taking care of your kids. But I think what some of us forget sometimes is everybody’s taking care of each other. And that is a beautiful thing about a multigenerational household.

NBC_8,Avoid mold and mildew with these expert-approved dehumidifiers,https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-dehumidifier-ncna1233988,2024-07-30 01:00:02.570163,,"It’s never too early to start thinking about purchasing a dehumidifier, and hot weather isn’t the only reason to invest in one.
Today’s dehumidifiers come in all shapes, sizes and tank capacities. To help you navigate the many choices that are out there and determine the best dehumidifier for your space, we spoke to experts about the benefits of dehumidifiers, the different types available and what to consider when shopping for one. We also rounded up highly rated options based on their expert guidance.
SKIP AHEAD How we picked the best dehumidifiers | The best dehumidifiers | How to shop for a dehumidifier
Dehumidifiers reduce the humidity levels in your home, because with high humidity comes moisture, which can do serious damage if not addressed. According to Chris Koehner, owner of Halo Heating & Cooling, too much moisture can cause doors to stick, create a musty smell in the air and even lead to mold and mildew, which in turn can trigger allergies or hinder people with asthma or other respiratory conditions. To avoid this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping humidity levels in your home as low as possible — no higher than 50%.
According to our experts, an air conditioner alone will not solve the problem of high humidity levels. “It can only work as a dehumidifier when it’s on,” says Koehner, “but even when it’s on, it’s not running continuously.”
Although the Department of Energy says the two primary performance ratings for dehumidifiers are capacity and energy efficiency — the DOE defines capacity as the amount of water a dehumidifier can remove in 24 hours, and energy efficiency as how many liters of water a dehumidifier can remove per kilowatt-hour of energy consumed — our experts recommend also keeping in mind the following factors when choosing a high-quality dehumidifier:
To help you find the right dehumidifier for your needs, we turned to the experts for shopping tips and sought out highly rated options based on their guidance.  All of our dehumidifier recommendations come in multiple tank sizes for various-sized rooms, and all but one have the Energy Star seal of approval, which means the organization has determined that it removes moisture using less energy than a similarly sized conventional unit.
This Honeywell smart dehumidifier removes up to 70 pints of moisture daily from medium to large rooms such as basements, dens and storage rooms, says the brand. It includes a drain hose for continuous drain operation and automatically senses room moisture levels and activates dehumidification to maintain desired humidity levels. Wi-Fi connected with Amazon Alexa voice control, — a 2.5 GHz connection is required — it lets you monitor humidity in your home through the Smart Dehumidifier App. It’s also compatible with Apple iOS9.0 (or later) and Android version 4.3 (or later).  
Moisture removal capacity: 70 pints | Tank capacity: 7 pints | Max. recommended room size: 3,000 sq ft | Weight: 35.2 pounds | Noise level: 50dB | Auto shutoff: Yes | Removable water filter: Yes | Drain Pump: Yes | Wheels: Yes
Nitrio says she’s become more impressed with the Frigidaire dehumidifier line. “I would suggest this dehumidifier as a good alternative to the Danby if it’s not in stock,” she says. “It’s easy to clean, and it’s a workhorse. It’s really robust in a high-humidity area, and it has the continuous drain option.” It’s also easy to move around, with caster wheels and side handles. The only caveat, she says, is that it does not have the auto restart feature.
Moisture removal capacity: 50 pints | Tank capacity: 2.1 gal | Max. recommended room size: 2,500 sq ft | Weight: 44 pounds | Noise level: 47dB. | Auto shutoff: Yes | Removable water filter: Yes | Drain Pump: Yes | Wheels: Yes
NBC Select staff-favorite brand Midea’s 22-pint dehumidifier has a 4.3-star average rating from 14,850 reviews on Amazon and was awarded Energy Star’s “Most Efficient 2023” designation, which the Environmental Protection Agency says “recognizes products that deliver cutting-edge energy efficiency along with the latest in technological innovation.” It removes up to 22 pints of moisture a day and has an adjustable humidity setting from 35% to 85%, says the brand. There’s an auto restart in case the power goes out, a digital control panel, along with handles and 360-degree caster wheels for easy portability. The unit automatically stops when the water tank is full, or you can connect a drainage hose to it, but it’s not included.
Moisture removal capacity: 22 pints | Tank capacity: 0.8 gal | Max. recommended room size: 1,500 sq ft | Weight: 33.29 pounds | Noise level: 46.5dB | Auto shutoff: Yes | Removable water filter: Yes | Drain Pump: Not included | Wheels: Yes
If you’re on the lookout for a heavy-duty dehumidifier for larger projects, then the BlueDri should be a top choice, says Nitrio. “There isn’t a place this [machine] can’t dehumidify,” she said. “It also comes equipped with temperature sensors, automatic water pumps and a high-tech digital panel.” Though this dehumidifier isn’t Energy Star certified, the brand says its efficient rotary compression helps extract up to 225 pints of water per day, more than double the amount of typical dehumidifiers. It can also dry up to 4,000 square feet and includes a 38-foot drain hose that can automatically pump water up to 16 feet in height so you can direct water out of a window if necessary.
Moisture removal capacity: 225 pints | Tank capacity: N/A | Max. recommended room size: 4,000 sq ft | Weight: 103 pounds | Noise level: NA | Auto shutoff: No | Removable water filter: Yes | Drain Pump: Yes | Wheels: Yes
If you’re looking for a dehumidifier for your basement or another larger space, this option from Black and Decker may be just what you need. It’s Energy Star-certified and can remove up to 50 pints of water a day, according to the brand. It has a built-in indicator light and alert system that notifies you when the drain is full, and also comes with a 3.28 foot drain hose, for continuous draining. The dehumidifier is also adjustable via the top-mounted control panel — the brand says that you can adjust the humidistat anywhere from 35-80% using the LED digital display. This model is also available in a version with a pump, and has a 4.3-star average rating from 1,076 reviews on Amazon.
Moisture removal capacity: 50 pints | Tank capacity: 1.8 gal | Max. recommended room size: 4,500 sq ft | Weight: 41.1 pounds | Noise level: NA | Auto shutoff: No | Removable water filter: Yes | Drain Pump: No | Wheels: Yes
Once you’ve determined the humidity level in a space is above 50% and needs to be addressed, there are a number of things to consider when shopping for a dehumidifier. Experts recommend keeping the following in mind:
Know the size of your space. Dehumidifiers are sized by the square footage of your space and by how many pints of fluid they can remove per day, so knowing the size of the space you’re working with, as well as the humidity level, is the first step to determining which dehumidifier is best for your needs.
Look for a built-in humidistat. Some dehumidifiers require considerably less maintenance than others given their features. “Ideally, shoppers should look for a model that has a built-in humidistat, which not only measures the relative humidity but also controls it automatically,” Nitrio said. “This takes the guesswork out of whether or not you need to turn your dehumidifier on or off.”
Opt for these standout features. In addition to a handy built-in humidistat, Nitrio recommends looking for some other standout features, including:
Make sure it’s energy efficient or carries the Energy Star seal of approval. Koehner warned against any model that isn’t isn’t energy efficient, especially if you’ll be running it throughout the day and night. “Dehumidifiers can increase energy usage and drive your electricity bill up,” he said.
According to experts, below are three equally important reasons to invest in a dehumidifier: 
Although the problem may start with humidity in a bathroom, says Koehner, it could eventually spread into your bedroom and closets, too. “It’s important to understand humidity’s wicking effect,” he explains. “When you drop a paper towel onto a spill, it wicks the liquid, pulling it into the sheet. That’s a great visual for how humidity works in your home — it doesn’t stay in one room.” 
“The ideal scenario is to have a smart thermostat that has a humidity sensor built right in,” says Derek Anneser, HVAC sales engineer for HTS , a full-service HVAC distributor in North America. But for those who don’t, he says the easiest way to measure the humidity level in your home is by using a hygrometer, which can be purchased for about $10 from retailers like Walmart or Amazon , Lowe’s or Home Depot . “If it says your humidity level is above 50%, you know you gotta kick it down,” says Anneser. 
According to the experts we consulted, a common mistake shoppers make is buying the wrong size unit. While some go with a smaller dehumidifier because it’s cheaper, they quickly learn that they need to invest in a second option in order to get the job done. There are also those who assume oversized units will give better results and go with one that’s too aggressive.  
“Units that are too small can’t keep up, but units that are too large have a different problem: They cool too fast, making them shut off before dehumidifying enough,” Koehner explained. “You get cold, damp air. That creates a recipe for mold.” 
It may be tempting to just buy a unit and put it on the highest setting, but this can actually cause more issues, say experts. “An incorrect setting can actually lead to mold growth in the dehumidifier, in addition to not removing enough moisture or removing too much moisture from the air,” Nitrio explained, adding that the ideal range for a home dehumidifier is between 30% and 50%.

NBC_9,"At least one child dead, seven others injured in stabbing attack in U.K.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/stabbing-southport-england-children-merseyside-rcna164090,2024-07-30 01:00:02.570163,,"Two children were killed and nine more were injured in what police described as a ""ferocious"" stabbing attack in northwest England Monday morning. A 17-year-old male was later arrested in connection with the violence.
The knife attack unfolded in Southport, a seaside town in Merseyside, which is north of Liverpool, Merseyside Police said. 
Authorities were called to a property on Hart Street at 11:50 a.m. (6:50 a.m. ET) on reports of a stabbing. 
“There are casualties,” police said. 
In update later Monday, police said that in total two children died in the stabbing attack, another nine were injured — six critically. Two adults were also critically injured in the incident.
Merseyside Police said in an update later on Monday that a 17-year-old male from Banks, a nearby village, had been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. He remains in custody and will be questioned regarding the incident. 
Police earlier said that a knife was seized as well. 
“Enquiries are ongoing to establish the movie for this tragic incident,” police said. Officials say the attack is not being treated as terror-related and no one else is believed to be connected to the incident. There is no wider threat to the public. 
Eight patients were treated with stab injuries, the North West Ambulance Service said. The patients were taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Aintree University Hospital and Southport and Formby hospital.
Many, if not all, of the victims appear to be children. Alder Hey Children’s declared a “major incident” Monday, saying “our emergency department is currently extremely busy,” while noting that the hospital was working with other emergency services to respond to the incident. 
Norwood Councillor Greg Myers said that he went to the scene of the incident where a police officer told him that a child had died following the attack on Hart Street, the U.K. Press Association reported. When asked if he could confirm the death of a child, he told the agency: ""That is my understanding of the situation.""
A “Taylor Swift Yoga and Dance Workshop” aimed at primary school children was taking place near where the knife attack unfolded, the BBC reported. The attack happened at the Hope of Hart children’s club, the BBC reported, citing journalist Tim Johnson of the local news outlet, Eye on Southport.
U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the Southport incident “horrendous and deeply shocking news.”
“My thoughts are with all those affected,” he wrote on X. I would like to thank the police and emergency services for their swift response. I am being kept updated as the situation develops.”
Patrick Hurley, the MP for Southport, said he was “deeply concerned” about the Hart Street incident. 
“I am hoping for the best possible outcomes to the casualties affected. My thoughts go out to all those affected, their loved ones and to the entire community,” he wrote on X. “The police have confirmed that an individual involved in the attack has now been detained. I am repeating the advice of the police to avoid the area whilst the police and ambulance teams support this incident.”Breaking News Reporter"
NBC_10,Ron Goldman's father files claim against O.J. Simpson estate seeking $117 million,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/ron-goldmans-father-files-claim-oj-simpson-estate-seeking-117-million-rcna164092,2024-07-30 02:00:02.661985,,"Ron Goldman’s father has filed a creditor's claim against O.J. Simpson's estate seeking $117 million, according to documents filed Thursday in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
The claim is filed in connection to a wrongful death suit brought by Goldman's parents, Fred and Sharon, in 1997 where a civil jury found Simpson “responsible” for the homicides of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Goldman, in 1997 and ordered him to pay millions of dollars in damages. Simpson was acquitted of killing the pair in criminal court. 
According to the claim filed by Fred, the total amount owed to him by O.J.'s estate is $117,041, 675.27, after the 1997 judgement was renewed three times in California court -- in 2006, 2015 and 2022. In 2022, the claim amount increased to $96.3 million, and since then, it has accrued an interest of $20.6 million.
""After July 25, 2024, the Claim Amount will accrue interest at the daily rate of $26,402.3630 until paid,"" the document states. 
In 2019, Fred said he and Sharon, who were divorced in 1993, have only managed to collect a little of their share of the tens of millions of dollars Simpson was ordered to pay. 
""It wasn’t about the money — it was about justice,"" he said at the time.
Brown Simpson, 35, and Goldman, 25, were found stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home in 1994.
On June 13, 1994, Goldman was returning sunglasses that Brown Simpson's mother had left at a restaurant where he worked. The two were stabbed and slashed dozens of times, and their bodies were found the next day.
What came afterwards was what has been dubbed the ""trial of the century"" that garnered mixed feelings from the public. Simpson was eventually acquitted.
In April, Simpson died of cancer. 
Goldman’s father told NBC News at the time that Simpson’s death only further underscored his grief for his son, who was found stabbed to death outside Brown Simpson’s home in Los Angeles on June 12, 1994.
“The only thing I have to say is, it’s just further reminder of Ron being gone all these years,” Fred said in a phone interview. “It’s no great loss to the world. It’s a further reminder of Ron’s being gone.”Breaking news reporter"
NBC_11,"Family offices are giving top staff equity, profit shares in battle for talent",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/family-offices-are-giving-top-staff-equity-profit-shares-battle-talent-rcna164151,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"A version of this article first appeared in CNBC’s Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high net worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.
Family offices are increasingly offering lucrative shares of equity and deal profits to staff amid a growing battle for talent, according to a top family office attorney. 
As family offices surge in size and number, and compete more directly with private equity firms and venture funds for top staff, they’re sweetening their compensation plans. Along with salaries and bonuses, many are now offering equity stakes and various forms of profit-sharing to give employees more upside and incentives.
Patrick McCurry, partner at McDermott Will & Emery LLP based in Chicago, who works with single-family offices, said family offices have to adapt to a more competitive hiring landscape.
“There is a war for talent,” McCurry said. “Family offices are competing for talent against each other, and against traditional private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.”
Family offices, the private investment arms of single families, are also shifting to profit shares as a way to better align the incentives of the staff with the family.
“It helps get everyone rowing in the same direction,” McCurry said.
In an article in the latest UBS Family Office Quarterly, McCurry said there are three common ways single-family offices are paying staff with deal and equity plans.
A profits interest gives an employee a share of upside in a deal or basket of deals. So if the family office buys a private company for $10 million and sells it for $15 million, the employee may get a share (say 5% or 6%) of the $5 million profit, or profit above a target or “hurdle.” If there is no profit, the employee gets no share. “Basically they don’t participate unless there is growth,” McCurry said.
They also save on taxes. Since the profit is a capital gain, the employee typically pays the long-term capital gains rate — which tops out at 20% — rather than the ordinary income rate, which can reach 37%.
A co-investment allows an employee or group to put their own money in an investment, effectively investing in a deal alongside the family. Often the family will lend a portion of the money to the employee for the investment, known as a leveraged co-investment. So an employee may put $100,000 into an investment, borrow another $200,000 from the family, and get a $300,000 stake.
If the deals make no profit, the employee loses their investment and potentially has to repay part of the loan. Family office owners like co-investments since it encourages employees to make less risky deals. They often pair co-investments with profit shares to create both upside and potential downside to staff.
“With co-invests you get a downside so you could get fewer ‘moonshot’ deals that would be high risk,” McCurry said.
If a family office is too complicated, with dozens of trusts, partnerships and funds that make it hard to issue profit shares or co-investments, they can sometimes offer phantom equity — notional shares of a basket of assets or fund or company that track performance without actual ownership. 
Phantom equity can be like a 401(k) plan that’s deferred tax free. But eventually it’s usually taxed at ordinary income rates, so it can be less attractive to the employee.
“It’s not as common, but it’s mainly used for simplicity,” McCurry said.
Because they serve a single family, family offices have more flexibility than many companies when it comes to designing pay plans. Yet McCurry said family offices that want to compete for talent need to start offering more forms of equity.
“There is a crowd effect,” he said. “The more family offices start offering it, the more employees expect it. You don’t want to be the outlier when everyone across the street is offering it.”"
NBC_12,Did this former ballerina kill her husband to be a 'single mother' — or in self defense?,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ashley-benefield-black-swan-murder-trial-what-need-know-rcna164096,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"A former ballerina charged with second-degree murder in the death of her estranged husband is on trial in Florida, with prosecutors alleging that she fatally shot him during a contentious custody battle that she insisted on winning “at all costs.”
But in tearful testimony Friday, Ashley Benefield, 33, described herself as a victim of persistent abuse who acted in self-defense when she fatally shot Doug Benefield, 58, in her home south of Tampa on Sept. 27, 2020.
“I was scared to death,” she testified. “I thought he was going to kill me.”
Here’s what you need to know about the case.
The couple met at a political event in August 2016 and married 13 days later, according to the prosecutor in the case, Suzanne O’Donnell, assistant state attorney for Florida’s 12th Judicial District. 
He was 54, Benefield testified. She was 24.
Within a year, she’d become pregnant and they’d tried establishing a ballet company together, though it failed, the prosecutor said in court. Benefield soon moved to Bradenton, Florida, O’Donnell said, so that her mother could help care for her during her pregnancy. 
O’Donnell said during the trial that Benefield decided early in the pregnancy that she wanted to be a single mother and did nothing to keep Doug Benefield informed of the fetus’s development after the move. But her husband was still trying to make their relationship work, the prosecutor said.
In an emailed letter March 15, 2018, Doug Benefield said he wanted to be a part of the child’s birth and life, O’Donnell said. Benefield was several weeks from her due date when the email was sent, O’Donnell said, but the next day she was induced and gave birth.
Benefield kept the delivery hidden from her husband, O’Donnell said.  
In his opening statement, Benefield’s lawyer, Neil Taylor, portrayed a very different picture of the couple’s troubled relationship. Benefield had come to fear her husband and moved to Florida to get away from him, he said. 
“She left him, he pursued her,” Taylor said. “She rejected him. He would not take no for an answer.”
In her testimony, Benefield described Doug Benefield as volatile, controlling and sometimes terrifying. She alleged that he punched holes in the walls of their home, that he struck their dog in the face so hard that the animal went unconscious, that he threw a loaded handgun at her, and that he fired a bullet into the ceiling after threatening to take his own life during an argument.
“I felt like I was living a nightmare,” Benefield testified. “I never knew what I was gonna get.”
Taylor introduced text messages between the couple at trial that he said corroborated his client's account.
The year the child was born, Benefield sought an injunction that would have barred Doug Benefield from seeing their baby. During a July 30, 2018, hearing, she raised the allegations that she later described at trial, according to a partial transcript of the hearing.
A judge denied the order, saying she did not find Benefield’s testimony credible, according to the NBC affiliate WFLA of Tampa. The judge granted immediate visitation rights to Doug Benefield, who had moved to Florida, O’Donnell said.
NBC News filed a records request seeking transcripts of Doug Benefield’s testimony and the judge’s decision that have not yet been provided. 
Benefield testified that in 2020, she planned on moving to Maryland with her mother, who had inherited a home there and that Doug Benefield intended on going, as well.
Taylor described the move as another unwanted pursuit. The prosecutor said the estranged couple had planned on using the move to reconcile — though he called Benefield’s participation in the plan as a “ruse.”
“She didn’t intend to reconcile or make this work,” O’Donnell said.  
O’Donnell pointed to a second injunction sought by Benefield at the time that accused Doug Benefield of child abuse. (Benefield testified that she sought the petition when her daughter started coming home with injuries after spending time with Doug Benefield. He was not accused of a crime in connection with the allegations, and the injunction case was ongoing when he was killed.)
As part of those proceedings, the estranged couple was evaluated by a psychologist. While talking with the psychologist together, Doug Benefield said their reconciliation included his wife dropping her petition — a fact that Benefield did not dispute, O’Donnell said. But in private conversations with the psychologist, O’Donnell said, Benefield said that she did not plan to withdraw it.   
O’Donnell described this difference as a potential motive in the shooting: The evaluation’s conclusions were to be revealed during a hearing Sept. 30, three days after Doug Benefield was shot.
But under cross-examination, Benefield testified that she didn’t confront Doug Benefield because she didn’t want to make him look bad in front of someone else.
“I wasn’t going to disagree with him in front of anybody,” she said.
On Sept. 27, while preparing for the Maryland move, the estranged couple got into an argument over whether they should continue packing, Taylor said. When Benefield said that she was exhausted, she testified, Doug Benefield became hostile and allegedly “body checked” her — slamming his shoulder into hers and nearly knocking her over.
The confrontation escalated, Benefield testified, when she ran for the front door. 
“He stopped me, he grabbed me by the hand and yanked me back,” she recalled. “He said, ‘where the f —- are you going?”
“I said, ‘I’m done and you need to leave now,’” she recalled.
Benefield testified that her husband struck her in the face — something he’d never done before, she said — leaving a swollen eye that she said were documented in photos taken by authorities. She ran to the bedroom, she testified, and grabbed her gun.
Doug Benefield appeared in the room’s doorway, she testified, and told her she was “done.”
Benefield said she raised the gun and told him to stop. He moved into what she described as a “fighting” stance, then lunged at her, she said.
“I started pulling the trigger,” she testified. “He kept coming at me.”
Benefield ran to a neighbor’s house and said she’d shot her husband after he attacked her, according to a complaint in the case. Doug Benefield was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Benefield was charged with second-degree murder that November.
According to O’Donnell, the only evidence of Benefield’s injuries were “superficial scratches.” And she said the trajectory of Doug Benefield’s fatal bullet wound was side to side.
“Doug Benefield was not coming at her at the time the fatal shot was fired,” she said.  
“This was a custody battle that this mother was going to win at all costs,” O’Donnell said. “The cost was the life of Doug Benefield, and that is murder.”Tim Stelloh is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_13,Staying out of pool helped Olympians Nic Fink and Adam Peaty secure swimming medals,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/staying-pool-helped-olympians-nic-fink-adam-peaty-secure-swimming-meda-rcna164021,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"PARIS — New Jersey native Nic Fink and British great Adam Peaty will share a memorable place in swimming history — and not just because they tied for silver in one of these Olympics' most exciting races.
They both achieved a measure of late-career glory, reaching the podium in the 100-meter breaststroke, after taking strong measures to de-emphasize swimming in their lives.
Fink, a 31-year-old with a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Tech has been working full-time since last year and only swims when he’s off the 9-to-5 clock.	
Peaty, who holds the world record in the 100 breast, very publicly took a break from swimming in 2023 to work on mental health issues and spend more time with his son.
“It’s an awesome experience,"" Fink told NBC News on Monday. ""I mean, Adam’s a legend in the sport and for him to go through everything he went through to find his way back to an Olympic podium is amazing. And you know, the fact that I was able to share the podium, let alone share a medal with him, is a huge honor.""
The American and Brit finished with identical times of 59.05, barely behind the gold medalist at 59.03, Nicolò Martinenghi of Italy, and just ahead of fourth-place German swimmer Melvin Imoudu at 59.11.
After the race late Sunday at Paris La Défense Arena in Nanterre, Fink reflected on his new approach to life and how it differs from earlier times he'd ""eat, sleep, swim, rinse and repeat"" and throw ""the kitchen sink"" at this sport.
That Fink won his first Olympic medal while working his day job proved to himself that he needs that kind of balance in life.
""I actually think that having the job, and pursuing more life things keeps me balanced and well rounded,"" he said Monday. ""So you know, just putting my energy and effort into something else while still focusing on swimming, still wanting to be elite has only helped me I think in the pool.""
Peaty, 29, had to fight back tears on Sunday night thinking about family and his journey to the podium.
The swimmer said his toddler George regularly asks him if he’s the “fastest boy” in the world. And even if he wasn’t that on Sunday, the British swimmer explained that he couldn’t have been happier with the results.
“I mean, you’re gonna make me cry again, any time you talk about my boy,” a smiling Peaty said after a reporter asked him about his son.
“In the car some days, when you have bad days ... my son asks me ‘Daddy, are you the fastest boy in the world?’ and (I say) ‘Mate, I sure hope so.’ But not today, not today. And I really truly believe this was meant to be, because in my heart, I’m so happy.” 
Even if there were times when self-doubt paralyzed Peaty — who still holds the world and Olympics records for this event at 56.88 and 57.13, respectively — the iconic British swimmer said no hole is too deep to find a way out.
""So I did it, you know, for my son. And my, this whole 14 months has been to show that you can literally get to the bottom of the bottom and try and find a way through,"" he said.Charlotte Gardiner is a producer for NBC News, based in London.

The U.S. men won their first Olympic team medal in gymnastics since 2008, earning a bronze. They edged out Great Britain for the third podium spot, while Japan and China won the gold and silver medals, respectively. 
The U.S. team's celebrations rivaled the rowdiest of college gymnastics meets, with the athletes cheering each other on through every twist and flip.
When they earned the bronze, many on the team broke down in tears. While the American women are accustomed to podium finishes, it is only the third team medal in the last 20 years for the U.S. men.
The bronze was in their grasp after a consummate performance in the first five rotations, but they had to get through the pommel horse first, which is never an easy task. It is comparable to the balance beam on the women’s side, which can vanquish even the best in the world.
Nedoroscik made the Olympic team based solely on the strength of his routine on the event. He faced an agonizing two-and-a-half hour wait on the sidelines during the final, going up last for the U.S. in the final rotation. His effort clinched the bronze medal.
They built early momentum with stellar rotations on still rings and vault, making significant improvements to their scores from the qualifying round, where they finished fifth.
""I was completely blacked out while I was running down the runway,"" Juda said of his flawless vault. ""I hit the table, and I just said, 'Alright, just hold it, just don't fall. Just please don't fall.'""
""Next thing I know, the ground's at my feet, and I stuck it at the Olympic Games,"" he said.
After competing in two of the six events, the U.S. occupied the top spot on the leaderboard.
Chants of “USA” erupted in Paris’ Bercy Arena after Hong became the third American to sail through parallel bars. He earned a 14.400, putting the U.S. in the second spot as they headed to high bar.
Richard was a star throughout the final for Team USA. He performed a monstrously difficult routine on high bar, sticking his dismount and posting a score that would have won a silver medal last year's world championships.
""I knew I had the whole U.S. behind me,"" Richard said. ""I knew I had these five guys cheering me on and I knew I wanted to do the best routine possible for them. When you feel that deep in your heart, it happens, and you stick that landing.""
As the U.S. anchor on floor, Richard delivered a clutch routine to wrap up the penultimate rotation. One of his skills on floor stems from breakdancing, a sport that is making its Olympic debut in Paris. 
He will compete alongside Juda in the all-around final on Wednesday. Nedoroscik is eyeing gold in the pommel horse final, which is slated for Saturday.
""We're out here representing the best country in the world,"" said U.S. national all-around champion Malone. ""It's just an incredible feeling anytime you get to wear USA on your chest, but especially at the Olympic Games.""I’m the newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital and cover all things gymnastics, culture and breaking news. My past work includes coverage of Simone Biles’ road to the 2024 Paris Olympics, the death of a fan at Taylor Swift’s “Eras Tour” and the Vermont shooting of three Palestinian students.

NBC_15,Ilona Maher is everyone's favorite Olympian on TikTok,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/ilona-maher-everyones-favorite-olympian-tiktok-rcna164024,2024-07-30 03:00:02.856827,,"TikTok's favorite Olympian is back on the world stage, and she's once again showing millions of viewers a glimpse into what life's like in the Olympic Village.
Ilona Maher, a member of the U.S. women's rugby team, brought her niche sport into the limelight three years ago when she shot to internet fame documenting her candid, sometimes awkward experience at the Tokyo Olympics.
Now, having amassed more than 1.6 million followers on TikTok and 1.5 million on Instagram, Maher is in Paris sharing her newfound appreciation for handball, poking fun at her own clumsy attempts at flirting, and showing off her opening ceremony outfit. Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce also appeared in one of Maher's videos, in which he declares his love for women's rugby.""I knew that if I kept this up, got people watching me on TikTok, they'd also tune in to my sport,"" Maher, 27, told NBC News' Savannah Sellers in an interview.
At the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021, the rugby star drew in millions with her series testing out the athletes' notorious cardboard beds — such as by performing yoga on it, doing burpees on it and giving birth to a teammate. She further captivated viewers with her impression of what it's like making small talk and struggling to flirt with other Olympians, as well as her raving over the deep-fried cheese in the Olympic Village.
Viewers who tuned in to Maher's videos often thanked her for ""carrying"" Olympic TikTok with her facetious updates, with some expressing a sudden interest in women's rugby after watching her content. The athlete also attracted praise from the likes of internet star Hank Green, who tagged Maher in a 2021 video saying he was ""hyped for women's rugby sevens this year.""
Maher, raised in Vermont, first tried rugby her senior year of high school before going on to play at Quinnipiac University, where she graduated in 2018 with a nursing degree. She joined USA Rugby right after college, and this year will be her second experience competing in the Olympics.
Outside of sharing snippets of her life as an elite athlete, Maher has also been vocal online about body acceptance, sharing that she has often received comments calling her body ""masculine"" because of her muscular build.
""There will always be negative people out there and they put women in a box, and they think women should be fragile and petite and quiet and meek, but that's not the case,"" Maher said through tears in a 2022 video. ""Women can be strong, and they can have broad shoulders and they can take up space and they can be big.""
The athlete has continued circulating her message in the Olympic Village this month, including by sharing a reminder about the diversity of body types seen among Olympians and by showing off how she fuels her body.
She also shared earlier this month that she has been considered overweight her whole life by body mass index standards, but that this form of measurement doesn't relay how much muscle an individual has or how fit they are as an athlete.
""So yeah, I do have a BMI of 30%. I am considered overweight,"" she said in a video replying to an Instagram comment. ""But alas, I'm going to the Olympics and you're not.""Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News."
NBC_16,U.S. airlines cut growth plans in a bid to stem profit-eating fare discounts,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/us-airlines-cut-growth-plans-bid-stem-profit-eating-fare-discounts-rcna164148,2024-07-30 03:00:02.856827,,"U.S. airlines are reducing their capacity through the end of the year in a bid to cool an oversupplied domestic market that has led to lower fares and reduced profits despite strong summer travel demand. For passengers, that could mean higher fares are on the way.
Over the last week, U.S. airlines had “one of the industry’s largest week-over-week capacity reductions,” shaving almost 1% off of their capacity planned for the fourth quarter, Deutsche Bank said in a note Sunday. Airlines now expect to grow flying about 4% year over year during the final three months of the year.
“Despite the sizeable overall reduction, we expect to see further cuts in the weeks ahead as carriers are expected to continue to refine their schedules,” Deutsche Bank airline analyst Michael Linenberg wrote in the note.
U.S. airline executives have noted strong demand but a domestic market that’s awash in flights, forcing them to dial back growth plans, which could drive up fares. The latest U.S. inflation report earlier this month showed airfare in June fell 5.1% from a year earlier and 5.7% from May.
Reducing capacity could drive up fares for consumers and boost airlines’ bottom lines, if travel demand holds up. Getting fares in the market that are profitable to airlines but palatable to consumers is crucial for the industry as consumers have pulled back on spending in other areas.
Third-quarter outlooks from Delta and United earlier this month disappointed investors, but their CEOs said they expected capacity pullbacks across the U.S. industry to materialize in August, helping results. Southwest Airlines forecast a potential drop in third-quarter unit revenue, a measure of how much money an airline brings in for the amount it’s flying. The airline said last week it will finally ditch its iconic open-seating model and introduce extra-legroom seats to drive up revenue.
American Airlines on Thursday reported a 46% decline in its second-quarter profit and said it plans to dial back its capacity growth in the coming months, expanding less than 1% in September over last year.
“That excess capacity led to a higher level of discounting activity in the quarter than we had anticipated,” CEO Robert Isom said on an earnings call last week. Overall, American plans to grow 3.5% in the second half of the year after expanding about 8% in the first six months of the year.
Low-cost and discount airlines have been more aggressive in cutting unprofitable routes and scaling back capacity. Those carriers plan to contract 2.2% in the fourth quarter from the same period of 2023, Deutsche Bank said.
JetBlue Airways, for example, has culled money-losing routes this year and deployed aircraft to more popular city pairs. The carrier is scheduled to report results before the market opens on Tuesday.
Spirit Airlines, meanwhile, warned of a wider-than-expected loss for the second quarter after nonticket revenue, which accounts for fees like checked bags and seating assignments, came in lighter than expected."
NBC_17,"AT&T, other phone companies sued over stolen nude images could face liability after court ruling",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/t-phone-companies-sued-stolen-nude-images-face-liability-court-ruling-rcna164142,2024-07-30 03:00:02.856827,,"Wireless providers including T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon have faced a string of lawsuits in recent years from women who allege retail employees stole intimate images or videos from their phones while helping them with in-store data transfers.
The cases are routinely dismissed when the companies argue they weren’t aware of the staffer’s actions and aren’t liable because the employees were acting outside the scope of their duties. But that could soon change after a recent court ruling, legal experts told CNBC.
Now, the companies — not just the store workers — could face liability in future litigation, which could lead them to address the hiring, training and data safety practices that victims argue led to the violations, the experts said.
The latest lawsuit against AT&T was filed Monday in California state court. A woman identified as Jane Doe alleged that an employee at a Los Angeles store stole her nude images and distributed them in February after she upgraded her iPhone and he helped her with transferring her data.
That case, filed by attorneys from the C.A. Goldberg law firm, now has a better chance of surviving and making it to trial after an April court ruling against T-Mobile involving a similar incident in Washington that was brought by the same law firm. Judge Stanley Bastian, the judge overseeing the T-Mobile case, ruled it could move forward after the company sought to have the lawsuit dismissed. 
T-Mobile, like other phone carriers, had argued it wasn’t aware of the employee’s actions and said he was acting outside the scope of his duties. But the judge decided the company could potentially be liable and ruled the case should proceed.
The ruling, described by the law firm as a “landmark” decision, is the first of its kind against a wireless carrier accused of negligence for hiring employees alleged to have stolen sensitive customer data, the firm said. It could affect the fate of future cases, including the lawsuit filed against AT&T on Monday, legal experts said.
“That decision sets important precedent and we intend to continue to try to hold phone companies accountable for situations like this where their employees violate customer privacy during phone trade-ins or other transactions at the stores,” said Laura Hecht-Felella from C.A. Goldberg, one of the lead attorneys behind both the T-Mobile and the new AT&T case. “There’s a lot of different ways in which they can try to prevent this from happening and it’s clear whatever they’re currently doing is not adequate.”
Carrie Goldberg, the firm’s founder, added that the “hope really is not to attract more cases” but to encourage the companies to have better safeguards in place. 
“That’s what litigation does. It says you can be held responsible for your negligence,” said Goldberg. “And presumably that will induce the phone companies to innovate on their safety and privacy protections for consumers at their stores.” 
AT&T did not immediately respond to a request to comment. T-Mobile declined to comment.
In the case against AT&T, the woman filed a police report, which remains under investigation, according to the lawsuit.
At least six other similar accusations have been levied against AT&T in the past either in civil lawsuits or police reports, according to the complaint. The dispositions of those cases are unclear. The cases mirror at least a dozen more alleged to have happened at other providers, such as T-Mobile and Verizon, according to news reports. 
Goldberg says she suspects the cases that have been made public are “just the tip of the iceberg,” and there are likely more that customers never detected. 
“We suspect that the phenomenon of theft at cellular phone stores is bigger than we can comprehend,” said Goldberg. 
“As a society, we trust these cellular providers with all of our most private information,” said Goldberg. “And really there’s no limit to what their employees can steal off of our phones and then share with the world.”
She added that her firm has received “case after case after case” where customers allege phone store employees stole their data. Goldberg said the issue cuts across companies, making it an “industry-wide” concern. 
Andrew Stengel, a New York attorney who specializes in cases involving the nonconsensual disclosure of intimate images, better known as revenge porn, reviewed the T-Mobile Washington decision for CNBC. He said future cases, such as the AT&T lawsuit, now have a better chance of surviving motions to dismiss and progressing because the attorneys will be able to point to that precedent in their arguments. 
“It should make judges think twice or three times before they dismiss a claim,” said Stengel, who has brought a similar case against T-Mobile in the past but isn’t involved in the current litigation. “It should be able to give judges not only pause, but ammunition to agree.” 
If lawsuits against wireless carriers related to the theft of intimate images are allowed to proceed, they move into discovery, which Stengel likened to the “crown jewels” of a legal case. 
During discovery, defendants are required to turn over documents that are relevant to the case, which could reveal damning and implicating information. 
“There could be information that the cell phone companies would be required to disclose that will increase liability in the future,” said Stengel. “If I were their attorney, I’d be very concerned about that.”
Stengel cautioned that while the Washington decision may be “exciting,” it’s not binding and judges in other jurisdictions can choose to ignore it. 
Still, Goldberg expects the decision to be “influential.” She said it could impel phone companies to finally make changes to prevent these sorts of abuses. 
“We think that the cellular providers are going to be a lot less arrogant about what they can get away with,” said Goldberg. “If you’re a company that is consistently hiring rando pervs that steal consumers’ most private, intimate pictures, then, it’s the company’s fault.”"
NBC_18,More colleges are offering AI degrees — could they give job seekers an edge?,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ai-degree-major-college-university-schools-rcna163462,2024-07-30 03:00:02.856827,,"As artificial intelligence continues to attract attention and investors, colleges and universities are beginning to market undergraduate AI degrees to students, from Arizona State University to the University of Texas at Dallas.
New graduates are coming into a rough tech job market. While computer science degrees were once seen as a golden ticket to high-paying tech jobs, now, it’s become harder to land tech internships or entry-level positions with increased competition and major cuts across the industry.
But AI majors and professors are hopeful that a more specialized course of study may help graduates stand out.
NBC News identified 13 major colleges and universities that began offering bachelor’s degrees in AI in the last six years. 
With some of the first AI majors just graduating in the last several years, it remains an open question how the majors will fare, but early signs suggest the new degree could give young job seekers an edge.
Carnegie Mellon University was the first in the U.S. to launch a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence in 2018, saying at the time that the major would address the “growing demand for AI specialists.” The University of Pennsylvania will be offering a major in AI starting this fall, while colleges known for their STEM research like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Purdue University also currently grant undergraduate degrees in AI.
“This is a pioneering and forward-looking interdisciplinary program,” University of Southern California professor Yolanda Gil said while announcing her school’s Artificial Intelligence for Business degree. “With this program, we will empower business and organizational leaders to understand the possibilities, as well as the limitations, of AI technologies and to help them better understand the people they serve, predict trends and improve decision-making processes.”
According to Reid Simmons, director of the AI major at Carnegie Mellon, there were initially some doubts at his school about how interested employers would be in an undergraduate major in AI. However, he described the reaction as “very positive.”
“Some of the bigger tech firms indicated that they would hire everybody,” Simmons said. “That was six years ago.”
Simmons noted that most of his students went to Big Tech companies. Now, students are working in other industries like health care, finance and robotics as well. While AI majors are not necessarily guaranteed an internship or job at a Big Tech company like Google or Apple in 2024, Simmons said that many of his students have found internships and jobs this summer.
Among them is Mehmet Deniz Birlikci, who graduated with a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Carnegie Mellon this past May and will be joining Amazon’s AGI division soon as an engineer. Birlikci was initially interested in studying computer science but switched to the AI major sophomore year.
“I was really viewing AI as a new computing paradigm which is a lot more flexible than hard coding rules,” Birlikci said.
He got an internship in 2022 with the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, where he helped train and deploy AI models. Birlikci credited the “branding that CMU AI gave” with helping him land the position.
As more students graduate with AI degrees, the programs are becoming more popular with students. Out of the around 250 incoming freshmen to the School of CS, Simmons noted, 200 noted in a survey that they were “considering” the AI major. While he acknowledged that not all students will end up declaring the major, it marked a substantial increase from the 30 to 35 majors the department estimated when originally establishing the program.
Still, landing a Big Tech job is not students’ primary motivation for choosing the major, Birlikci said. “[Students] are much more interested in getting their hands dirty building things and really leaving an impact than just get[ting] pure jobs,” he said.
Birlikci also noted that since only a few colleges in the U.S. offer an AI major, it’s hard to tell whether the seeming success of these students on the internship or job hunt is due to their college’s general prestige or the skills learned in the major.
“There’s a radical difference between the top schools such as UPenn, MIT or Carnegie Mellon and what it means to come out of them,” Birlikci said.
Emma Twitmyer, a rising junior at Penn, is one of the first students at her school to major in AI. Twitmyer noted that she has already finished transferring her credits to her new major.
“In the world that we live in today, a technical degree is always an asset, and this degree will absolutely be technical in nature,” Twitmyer said, adding that she believes majoring in AI will allow students to pursue careers in many fields.
Twitmyer said that there are “plenty of us transferring this year,” with more students in younger grades to follow.
Julie Steele, also in the Class of 2026, is majoring in Course 6-4, Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which first started offering the major in 2022.
This summer, Steele is interning at Citadel as a software engineering intern. An internship at Citadel is one of the most coveted among college students; recently, Business Insider reported that out of tens of thousands of applicants, only 300 were selected this year, with the company focusing on attracting “top talent.”
Steele said that although her current internship doesn’t directly involve AI, her past experiences have been AI-focused. Steele works as a researcher for MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and was a Data Science & AI Engineering and Research Intern for Nasdaq, per her LinkedIn.
While she’s heard fellow students talk about how it’s been harder to find internships, Steele noted that the people she knows majoring in Course 6-4 have landed a variety of summer opportunities, including doing research or software engineering and finance-related internships.
According to Nancy Xu, founder of the AI-powered tech recruiting platform Moonhub, a bachelor’s degree in AI may appeal to employers who aren’t looking for AI researchers but “great software engineers who have an understanding of AI.”
“Ultimately, we don’t have enough people who work in AI and we need more people,” Xu said.Victoria Feng is an intern on the NBC News technology desk."

The slaying was feuled by an ongoing feud between rival gangs, according to a statement from Tampa police.
The Jacksonville rapper, whose real name is Charles Jones, was fatally shot in the early morning June 23 in a parking lot of an uptown Tampa hotel. When police arrived there, they found two vehicles that had been shot at in the parking lot.
The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said on Monday in a post on social media there were three arrests in the case on Saturday. The suspects were identified as Sean Gathright, 18, Alicia Andrews, 21, and Isaiah Chance Jr, 21.
Andrews and Chance are charged with premeditated first-degree murder with a firearm, and conspiracy to commit premeditated first-degree murder with a firearm, according to police.
Gathright is charged with two counts of  premeditated murder with a firearm, three counts of attempted premeditated murder in the first degree with a firearm and tampering with physical evidence, police said. 
“They are currently in the Duval County Pre-Trial Detention Center on murder charges, pending transfer to Tampa,” the sheriff’s office said.
The suspects at large are Rashad Murphy, 30, and Davion Murphy, 27, police said. They are each charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder. Police did not specify if the two are related. 
On the day of Jones' slaying, Chance and Andrews tracked down and followed him and his entourage to two separate locations, police said.
At each location, they got out of their vehicle, and Chance used a cell phone. After using the phone, a second suspect vehicle arrived at each location, police said. Both vehicles then followed Jones to the hotel,  according to police.
At the crime scene, one vehicle drove by the victims' parked vehicles twice and left, then three armed shooters exited a vehicle and began shooting at Jones' vehicles, killing Jones and injuring three others, police said.
The shooters were identified by Tampa police as Rashad Murphy, Sean Gathright and Davion Murphy. 
Jones was documented by the sheriff’s office to be a “6 Block” gang member in Jacksonville. The gang has a feud with the gangs “ATK” and “1200.” Chance is an ATK member, Rashad Murphy is a 1200 member, and Davion Murphy is a 1200 associate, police said.
“The feud between 6 Block and its rival gangs, ATK and 1200, has spanned over a decade with dozens of murders by and against both sides,” police said.
 It was not immediately clear Monday afternoon if the arrested suspects had retained attorneys. 
The case is ongoing, according to the sheriff’s office.
The sheriff’s office posted video of the three suspects' arrests.
“There’s no place you’ll be able to hide if you commit crime in Jacksonville or any other city in the state of Florida,” Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Walters said in a social-media statement.
State Attorney Susan Lopez said in a press conference Monday afternoon: “All five of these defendants are facing life in the Florida State Prison, even the ones who didn’t pull the trigger. In Florida, if you participate in the planning of a murder, you can be held accountable for the person’s death, and that is what we intend to do here.”
She continued, ""It is clear that they all had one purpose in coming to Tampa, and that was to kill.""
Lopez reminded the public about the emotional toll homicides have on victims' families.
“His fans knew him as 'Julio Foolio,' but to his mom, he’s Charles. We’re fighting to make sure that she gets justice.”
Two suspects remain at large. The suspects and victim are members of rival Jacksonville gangs and the suspects conspired to commit the murder in Tampa, according to police, NBC affiliate First Coast News in Jacksonville reported.
Jones was celebrating his birthday the night of his fatal shooting, according to footage he posted on his Instagram story. The 26-year-old rapper had 1 million followers on the platform. He shared a video advertising a pool party and told his followers to direct-message him for the address.
Later that night, he posted that police had “shut us down and kicked us out” of the Airbnb.
His lawyer, Lewis Fusco, had written in a statement that Jones then relocated to a Holiday Inn, where he was reportedly ambushed in the parking lot. In April, when announcing the release of his latest album, “Resurrection,” Jones also posted that he had already survived “MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS ON MY LIFE.”
The artist had been making music since 2015.

The new software called Apple Intelligence was released in the developer beta of iOS 18.1. It is also available in similar releases for iPad and Mac. It is currently only available to registered Apple developers. Apple’s developer program costs $99 a year.
In addition, users will have to register for a waitlist inside Apple’s settings app after updating to gain access to the service, which involves pinging Apple servers for more complicated requests.
Later this year, it will be released to the public, but the 18.1 version number suggests Apple Intelligence will not be released alongside new iPhone hardware, which is expected to be launched running iOS 18 in the fall.
Apple Intelligence is an important initiative for Apple. Investors hope the tight integration of AI with Apple’s operating system can spur a big wave of upgrades in the coming years, especially since the system will only work on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and newer.
″We expect this iPhone cycle to remain strong for longer as AI feature sets (software and possibly hardware) improve in the 2025 iPhone,” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note Monday.
The preview does not include everything in Apple Intelligence the company demoed at its annual developers conference in June.

He and partner Miles Evans made quick work of a French duo, winning their opening Olympic match in two sets, 21-14 and 21-11.
The trip to Paris has been a whirlwind for Budinger and Evans and they're soaking in every moment of it, mingling with fellow athletes, especially NBA players on Team USA.
""It was super super awesome to see the respect that they gave him,"" Evans told NBC News. ""It was just like, wow, really like this guy is my partner?"" 
When they came upon James, the NBA's leading scorer seemed surprised to run into Budinger in France.
""It took like a double take for LeBron,"" Budinger said. ""He's like walking by and I yelled his name and he kind of looked and he's like, 'Chase? What?'""   
Budinger said he and Evans chatted on the bus to the match, reminding themselves to remain calm after stepping on sands under the Eiffel Tower, where a makeshift volleyball stadium and hostile crowd greeted them.
The former Pacers, Suns, Timberwolves and Rockets forward said he'll always remember how nerves got the best of him in his rookie debut, recalling Monday that he went 0-for-2 with an airball and two turnovers. And his memory was generally correct, as he missed his only two 3-point shots and gave away the ball twice that night in Portland in 2009.
""The first game I played in the NBA and this happened,"" he said. ""I played awful. ... And one of my shots I had was an airball. So the nerves affected my game. I felt like I was able to get a couple points (Tuesday) early and that kind of kind of relieved some of that stress."" 
The Americans were too tall, powerful and fast for the French duo of Youssef Krou and Arnaud Gauthier-Rat, who benefitted from a spirited home crowd.
After a dramatic point won by the Americans to take an early 7-2 lead, Evans gestured to the crowd bringing chants of ""USA, USA"" from out-numbered but spirited U.S. fans, and loud cries of ""Allez les bleus!"" — which translates to ""Go blues!"" — from patriotic locals. 
Evans said he insisted he wasn't taunting the French fans.
""You know, honestly, just trying to get the entire crowd on our side,"" Evans said. ""If we could just feel that support, even if they're not supporting us, maybe try to convert a couple. "" 
After the first set, fans spontaneously broke out into French national anthem “La Marseillaise,” briefly energizing Krou and Gauthier-Rat.
""It definitely lived up to expectations man. This is absolutely unbelievable, absolutely breathtaking and the feeling out there is unreal,"" Budinger said. ""I felt like it went too fast. I felt like there were times where I should have enjoyed the view a little more."" 
Budinger and Evans entered this tournament as the world’s No. 13 duo, and their French opponents No. 34. The competition gets tougher for the Americans as they take on No. 5 Stefan Boermans and Yorick de Groot of the Netherlands on Tuesday and the No. 17 Spanish team of Pablo Herrera and Adrian Gavira on Friday.

NBC_22,Regulators consider first federal rule on AI-created political ads,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/first-federal-rule-ai-created-political-ads-rcna163949,2024-07-30 05:11:03.046249,,"Amidst a campaign tinged by concerns about so-called “deep fakes,” the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a first-of-its-kind rule to mandate disclosure of AI-generated content in political ads, though it may not go into force before the election.
Regulators have been slow to grapple with the new technology, which allows people to use cheap and readily available artificial intelligence tools to impersonate others. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel says disclosure is a critical — and perhaps just as importantly, doable — first step in regulating artificially created content
“We spent the better part of the last year in Washington handwringing about artificial intelligence,” Rosenworcel said in an interview with NBC News. “Let’s do something more than handwringing and pearl clutch.”
The new rule would require TV and radio ads to disclose if they include AI-generated content, sidestepping, for now, the debate about whether that content should be banned outright. Existing laws prevent outright deception in TV ads.
“We don’t want to be in a position to render judgment; we simply want to disclose it so people can make their own decisions,” Rosenworcel. 
The move was inspired in part by the first-known deepfake in American national politics, a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden that told voters not to turn out in January’s New Hampshire primary. 
“We kicked into high gear because we want to set an example,” Rosenworcel said of the swift official response to the New Hampshire deep fake. 
The political consultant behind the deepfake robocall, who was outed by NBC News, is now facing a $6 million fine from the FCC and 26 criminal counts in New Hampshire courts. The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday threw its weight behind a private lawsuit brought by the League of Women Voters. 
The consultant, Steve Kramer, claimed he only made the ad to highlight the danger of AI and spur action.
Some political ads have already started using artificially generated content in both potentially deceptive and non-deceptive ways, and the generic AI content is becoming more common in non-political consumer ads simply because it can be cheaper to produce.
Some social media companies have implemented bans on AI-created political ads. Congress has considered several bills. And about 20 states have adopted their own laws regulating artificial political content, according to the non-profit Public Citizen, which tracks the efforts.
But advocates say national policy is necessary to create a uniform framework. 
The social media platform X has not only not banned videos created with AI, but its billionaire owner, Elon Musk, has been one of their promoters. Over the weekend, he shared with his 192 million followers a doctored video made to look like a campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris.
The government does not regulate social media content, but the FCC has a long history of regulating political programing on TV and the radio, including maintaining a database of political ad spending, with information that TV and radio stations are mandated to collect from ad buyers. The new rule would just have broadcasters also ask ad-buyers if their spot was made with AI.
The Federal Elections Commission, meanwhile, has been considering its own AI disclosure rules. The Republican chairman of the FEC wrote to FCC Rosenworcel asking her agency to stand down, arguing his is the rightful regulator of campaign ads.
Rosenworcel brushed past the inter-agency squabbling, noting both agencies — along with the IRS and others — have played complimentary roles in regulating political groups and spending for decades. The FCC also regulates a wider range of ads than the FEC, including so-called issue ads run by nonprofits that do not expressly call for the defeat of the election of a candidate. 
And advocates note the FEC has a difficult time doing much of anything because it is, by-design, split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, making consensus rare.
“We’re barreling towards elections which may be distorted, or even decided, by political deepfakes. Yet this is an entirely avoidable dystopia, if regulators simply demand disclosures when AI is used,” said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, who said he hopes the FCC rule will be finalized and implemented “as soon as possible.”
Still, while Rosenworcel said the FCC is moving as quickly as possible, federal rulemaking is a deliberate process that requires clearing numerous hurdles and time for public input.
“There will be complicated questions down the road,” she said. “Now is the right time to start this conversation.”Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News. "
NBC_23,"The first Fed interest rate cut in years is on the horizon. Here's what homeowners, buyers need to know",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/first-fed-interest-rate-cut-years-horizon-homeowners-buyers-need-know-rcna164173,2024-07-30 05:02:03.046249,,"The Federal Reserve is poised to make the first interest rate cut in years this fall, which can influence mortgage rates to go down.
Even small cuts in rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay. To that point, people in the market to buy a home have been eagerly waiting for the central bank to cut rates.
The Fed is meeting this week, but experts say it seems more likely the first rate cut will come in September. That would be the first rate cut since 2020 at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
While there is a less than 6% chance of a rate cut in the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, according to the CME’s FedWatch measure of futures market pricing, there is a much greater likelihood of quarter-point reductions in September, November and December.
That along with further cuts in 2025 would bring the the Fed’s benchmark fed funds rate to below 4% by the end of next year, according to some experts.
While mortgage rates are fixed and mostly tied to Treasury yields and the economy, they are partly influenced by the Fed’s policy. Home loan rates have already started to come down, in part induced by a Fed slowdown.
Here’s what homeowners and buyers need to know.
The first rate cut is almost entirely priced into financial markets already, especially bond markets, said Chen Zhao, the economic research lead at Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm. In other words, mortgage rates aren’t going to change much once the Fed actually begins to cut back, she said.
“A lot of these rate cuts are already priced in,” she said.
The 30-year fixed rate mortgage declined to 6.78% on July 25, down from 7.22% on May 2, according to Freddie Mac data via the Fed.
“Refinancings are starting to tick up, it’s not a huge wave yet, but they are starting to pick up a little bit as rates start coming down,” Zhao said.
Refinance activity on existing home loans was up 15% from the previous week, reaching the highest level since August 2022, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. It was 37% higher than a year ago, MBA found.
Whether homeowners should refinance depends in part on their existing rate, said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic.
“There are people that originated when mortgages peaked at 8% in the fall of last year,” Hepp said. For those buyers, “there is some opportunity there.”
To be “in the money,” or when it makes sense to refinance, homeowners need to see a notable drop in mortgage rates in order to benefit, experts say. The prevailing rate should be at least 50 basis points below your current rate. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
While that can be a good strategy, it’s not a “hard and fast rule,” said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.
Timing the refinance of your home will depend on factors like your monthly mortgage payment and if you can pay closing costs, he said: “There’s a lot of variability.” (When you refinance a mortgage, you are likely to incur closing costs, as well as an appraisal and title insurance; and the total price tag will depend on your area.)
“The saving has to outweigh your upfront costs,” Zhao explained.
Even if your existing mortgage has a high rate, you might want to consider waiting until the central bank is further along in its cuts, with the expectation that rates are to steadily decline throughout the year and into 2025, Zhao said.
If you are thinking about it, reach out to lenders and see if refinancing now or in the near future makes the most sense for you, Channel said.
While lower rates can come as a relief for cost-constrained homebuyers, the real effects of lower borrowing costs are still up in the air, according to Zhao.
For instance: If borrowing costs for home loans come down, there’s a chance more buyers will jump in the market. And if demand outpaces supply, prices might go up even more, she said. It can “offset the relief you get from mortgage rates.”
But what exactly will happen in the housing market “is up in the air” depending on how much mortgage rates decline in the latter half of the year and the level of supply, Channel said.
“Timing the market is basically impossible,” Channel said. “If you’re always waiting for perfect market conditions, you’re going to be waiting forever. Buy now only if it’s a good idea for you.”Ana Teresa Solá is a personal finance reporter for CNBC."
NBC_24,This 18-year-old could lead U.S. back to artistic swimming glory in the Olympics,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/18-year-old-lead-us-back-artistic-swimming-glory-olympics-rcna162765,2024-07-30 05:13:03.046249,,"Megumi Field was a toddler the last time the U.S. qualified for the Olympic artistic swimming team event. Now, the 18-year-old is part of the team preparing for its big return.
“I’ll be excited for college once the Olympics [are] over. But right now, all I can think about is the Olympics,” Field told NBC News’ ‘Stay Tuned.’ “I just can’t wait to be in that moment, ready to show the world what we’ve been working on.”
When Field was a child, she didn’t have a need for speed. She had a need for water. 
“I’ve always loved the water. I’ve always loved chlorine,” she said. “The moment I was born, I think I was just in the water.”
Field began artistic swimming when she was five years old. At the time, she lived in Delaware and traveled to Pennsylvania every day for practice. By the age of 10, her family moved to California so she could train more and it paid off. Field competed on two 12-and-under teams and made the U.S. Senior National Team when she was just 14-years-old. Since then, she’s competed in countless competitions and has grown her medal count.
Going into the Paris Games, Field has 16 gold, one silver, and six bronze medals under her belt from other competitions.
Artistic swimming used to be called synchronized swimming. Kennedy Shriver, who manages communications for USA Artistic Swimming, said World Aquatics changed the name after the 2016 Olympic Games to better illustrate what the sport is about. The rebrand came from its similarity to artistic gymnastics.
It isn’t just about being in sync anymore.
“I think artistic swimming combines a lot of different sports like gymnastics, dance, ballet, speed swimming, even diving,” Field said. 
Team USA coach Andrea Fuentes called it “the craziest sport a human can do.”
“We don’t [breathe] while we are upside down,” she said. “We throw our flyer in the air, up to nine feet while she does the acrobatics of a gymnast.” 
Swimmers also tread water the entire time and never touch the bottom of the pool.
In the 2024 Summer Olympic Games, artistic swimming will be broken into two events: team and duet. Within each event, there are multiple routines which have been perfected over multiple years. The coaching staff begins choreography in the pool and then finalizes it on land before heading back into the water. The free routine allows teams to show off their personality and creativity. But technical routines can be a bit more rigid.
“In tech, everyone has to do the same thing,” Field explained. “If you don’t, you can get penalized … all countries do the same technical elements.”
The 2024 Games will also require the team event to include acrobatic routines for the first time.
Artistic swimming was added to the Olympic Summer Games in 1984. Team USA took home the team and duet gold that very year but hasn’t secured a double gold since.
That could change in 2024.
“I want to get the U.S. back on the stage,” said Field, who will be competing in both the team and duet events. “I’ve grown up watching us dominate basically all the sports and … when I think of … gold medals, I think of the U.S.”Caroline Howe is a producer for NBC News' ""Stay Tuned."" "
NBC_25,"As a possible Harris VP pick, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s abortion record gets fresh scrutiny",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/andy-beshear-abortion-record-kentucky-harris-vp-rcna163974,2024-07-30 05:00:03.046249,,"One of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear‘s strengths in the race to become Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate is that he could appeal to centrist voters as a Democrat who won re-election in a state that Donald Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points in 2020.
Beshear won his 2023 campaign, in part, by leaning into his support for abortion rights in a state where the procedure is almost entirely banned. Yet for some reproductive rights advocates in Kentucky, Beshear has not done enough on an issue that is critical for the party nationally — which could factor into his chances of joining the presidential ticket. 
“The low bar here doesn’t help him,” said Savannah Trebuna, the abortion fund director at Kentucky Health Justice Network, a Louisville-based reproductive rights organization, referring to the expectations for a Democratic governor in a red state.
“Yes, he’s doing better than a conservative would, and I’m thankful for that,” she continued. “But I worry about how that record will look on a national stage.” 
Abortion was perhaps the top issue propelling Democrats to a better-than-expected showing in the 2022 and 2023 elections, and it’s expected to be a major factor again in November. It’s one of Harris’ signature issues as well. With a president who was not naturally comfortable talking about abortion, Harris has been the public face for the White House in advocating for expanded access. 
Beshear’s less clear-cut record, especially from the years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, already appears to be a topic of discussion in Democratic and reproductive rights circles as he gets vetted as a potential vice presidential nominee. 
Critics point to Beshear’s choice of a self-described “personally pro-life” Democrat, Jacqueline Coleman, to be his lieutenant governor; his focus on rare exceptions when talking about abortion; and that his administration has avoided working closely with reproductive rights groups in the state. 
During his first gubernatorial campaign in 2019, Beshear’s allies clashed behind the scenes with reproductive rights groups over what message to run in ads, with Beshear’s team wanting to focus less on abortion and more on his unpopular Republican incumbent opponent, according to a source involved in the effort.
“He’s no hero, especially among reproductive rights organizations,” said an activist on the issue who requested anonymity to speak candidly. 
The question is whether Beshear’s approach would serve as a liability on the ticket by muddling Democrats’ message, or as a benefit to have a governor who has won on the issue in a red state. 
A longtime Democratic operative familiar with the concerns of several reproductive rights groups said some of Beshear’s views and public stances on abortion are viewed negatively and could hurt his chances at being chosen as Harris’ running mate. The operative said the governor is viewed as a “B minus“ on abortion issues by some in the reproductive rights community. 
“I don’t think it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh, Andy Beshear is an anti-abortion Democrat,’” the person said. “He’s definitely pro-choice. … He’s just not the best of all those candidates.”
Eric Hyers, a political strategist for Beshear, said the governor “is pro-choice and believes this is a decision that should be between a woman and her doctor” and “has governed as a pro-choice governor.” Hyers added that both Beshear and Coleman supported Roe v. Wade when it was the federal precedent and back codifying it into federal law.
In response to a request for comment about Beshear’s abortion record, Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz shared a statement he released last week saying that the search for a running mate “has begun in earnest” and that they “do not expect to have additional updates” until the announcement is made.  
Another Harris campaign official said the vice president is “choosing her running mate based on similar qualities to those that President Biden believed were important when he chose her four years ago, a choice the president calls ‘the best decision he has ever made.’”
The official said Harris is looking for someone with “shared values of fighting for the middle class, protecting democracy and freedoms, treating people with respect and dignity, and creating an America where everybody gets a fair shot.” The person also said Harris is looking for a “governing partner who has the experience to step into the job and be effective on day one.”
Harris is considering “about a dozen” vice presidential candidates, according to two people familiar with the process. They include North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. And, like Beshear, their records are facing more scrutiny. Kelly recently came out in favor of a pro-union bill that he had previously expressed concerns about, and Shapiro’s support for school vouchers and pro-Israel stances have been getting an extra look. 
Following a campaign event in Georgia on Sunday, Beshear directly addressed criticisms that he hadn’t done enough on abortion.
“I’m the first Democrat in Kentucky that has ever run an abortion ad​​ during an election,” he told reporters. “I’ve vetoed five separate anti-choice bills. I’ve stood up every single time, knowing that it would be one of the number one attacks on me.”
Allies of Beshear pointed out that he vetoed four anti-abortion bills before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. One bill put in place a 15-week abortion ban with no exceptions for rape and incest (it was enacted after Republicans’ supermajority in the state Legislature overrode the veto). Another two bills from 2021 allowed Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron to penalize abortion facilities and stripped the governor of power to suspend laws related to abortion. Both of Beshear’s vetoes were overridden by the Republican supermajority.
His allies also highlighted a Beshear campaign ad that gained national attention, featuring a Kentucky woman — Hadley Duvall — who said she became pregnant after being raped at age 12 by her stepfather. A Beshear-championed bill named after her, that would have carved out exceptions in the current Kentucky law for rape and incest, failed during this year’s legislative session.
Beshear won a “very tough re-election campaign” in 2023 “with abortion access and communicating about abortion access being a major focal point,” said Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper. “He spent millions of dollars on ads talking about reproductive freedom and fundamental freedom. I’d say that is the definition of running on offense” on the issue, she added.
Kentucky Democratic state Sen. Cassie Chambers Armstrong, who has fought for reproductive rights in the Legislature, said she felt Beshear “has always governed in a way that is pro-choice — and I know he’s gotten a lot of political pushback for that — but I’ve always felt like he has had our back on this issue.”
She pointed to his vetoes, as well as his maneuvering — during his time as attorney general and his first months as governor — to grant a Louisville Planned Parenthood clinic a license to provide abortion care in the state (the clinic became only the second one to provide abortion care in the state at that time).
Kentucky’s GOP-controlled Legislature passed a so-called “trigger ban” on abortion in 2019 — the same year Beshear ousted Republican Matt Bevin as governor — prohibiting the procedure in every situation except when a doctor has deemed the woman’s life to be at risk. That law snapped into full effect after Roe was overturned in 2022.
In November 2022, Kentucky voters rejected an anti-abortion ballot measure that would have amended the state constitution to explicitly say it does not protect a right to abortion.
Noam Lee, the former executive director for the Democratic Governors Association, pushed back against criticisms that Beshear was weak on abortion rights.
“That is bull----,” Lee said. “He ran a campaign centered on reproductive rights in 2023.”
Beshear has been outspoken in his support for abortion rights, but he often focuses on the more extreme situations and exceptions, framing it around the need to protect victims of rape, incest and women whose health is at risk. 
“My opponent’s position would give a rapist more rights than their victim. … It is wrong. We need to change this law. We need to make sure that those individuals have that option,” he said during an October 2023 debate. 
Last May, Beshear lambasted a new sweeping abortion ban in Tennessee, telling The Associated Press, “Like Kentucky, Tennessee has some of the most extreme laws in the country, where victims of rape and incest don’t have the necessary options.”
“He only ever talks about abortion through the lens of exceptions for rape and incest,” the state reproductive rights activist critical of Beshear said. “He’s just focused on exceptions, and not [broader reproductive] care.”
The person added that Beshear would “100%” be a liability on a national ticket seeking to advance broader reproductive freedoms.
But former Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., said Beshear’s stance on abortion should be seen against its red-state backdrop and that it wouldn’t hurt Harris. 
“I think everybody’s looking for the perfect candidate. There is no such thing,” Yarmuth said. “Voters who are persuadable at this point are not issue voters. If you’re an issue voter, you’ve already made up your mind. They’re more visceral voters, and that’s why I think Andy’s got a great strength — because he reeks of empathy.”
Another concern about picking Beshear is that if he is ultimately elected vice president, his lieutenant governor, Coleman, would take over as governor. 
She gives reproductive rights advocates pause because in 2014, she described herself as “a pro-life compassionate Democrat.” When chosen by Beshear to be his running mate in 2019, her spokesperson said she was “personally pro-life” but “does not believe politicians should impose their views on others, which is why she supports each individual woman’s constitutional right to make her own reproductive and health care decisions.”
While some other reproductive rights advocates in the state were more forgiving of the tough political landscape Beshear has to navigate in socially conservative Kentucky, they agreed that, when it came to the national ticket, they’d prefer someone with a far more substantive record on the pivotal issue of abortion. 
Trebuna, of the Kentucky Health Justice Network, said Beshear had largely pushed a “milquetoast and broad” message of reproductive rights and choice. 
“And to me, that just signals it would be more of the same” from a national ticket with Beshear, she added. 
But another reproductive rights advocate said they thought Beshear’s position was less important because any running mate would have to adopt Harris’ approach.
“I’m totally at ease with VP Harris’s position and her agenda,” said the advocate, who was not authorized to discuss the vice presidential speculation on the record, “and I believe that any vice president will take on her agenda.” Adam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.

In today’s edition, senior political editor Mark Murray breaks down the widening gender gap in polls of the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Plus, we report on how VP contender and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's position on abortion rights is getting a second look.
Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.
A slew of national and battleground state polls since President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race find a much closer contest than we saw after his dismal debate performance. 
But these polls reveal another important dynamic: an enormous gender gap between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — in some cases bigger than the one in 2016 and 2020.
Take the recent New York Times/Siena College poll. Harris holds a 14-point lead over Trump among likely female voters (55% to 41%), while Trump holds a 17-point lead among men (56% to 39%). That’s a net 31-point gender gap. 
It’s even bigger in the latest Quinnipiac University poll, where women are breaking for Harris by 16 points (56% to 40%) and men are siding with Trump by 23 points (60% to 37%). (Note: The Quinnipiac poll was conducted before and after Biden exited the 2024 race.) That’s a whopping 39-point gender gap. 
Compare that to the race between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016, when the NBC News exit poll found the net gender gap at 24 points. In the exit poll after the 2020 Biden-Trump contest, that figure stood at 23 points. 
Now, other recent surveys show a smaller gender gap. CNN’s national poll had it at 16 points between Harris and Trump, and one from NPR/PBS/Marist was a mere 4 points.  
And remember, these kinds of demographic deep dives have larger margins of error — so numbers are bound to fluctuate from poll to poll. 
But in general, these new polls underscore how a widening gender gap could be a significant factor in the new Harris-Trump race — as well as how Trump’s advantage among men seems larger than Harris’ edge among women.
One of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's strengths in the race to become Harris’ running mate is that he could appeal to centrist voters as a Democrat who won re-election in a state that Donald Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points. 
Beshear won his 2023 campaign, in part, by leaning into his support for abortion rights in a state where the procedure is almost entirely banned.

NBC_27,Judge temporarily bans Wayne LaPierre from returning to lead the National Rifle Association but does not appoint a monitor,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-temporarily-bans-wayne-lapierre-returning-lead-national-rifle-as-rcna163637,2024-07-30 06:00:02.710471,,"A New York judge on Monday temporarily banned Wayne LaPierre from returning to lead the National Rifle Association but said he would not appoint an independent monitor to oversee the gun rights group.
State Supreme Court Judge Joel Cohen denied one of the most significant remedies proposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James after a jury found the NRA and its executives liable in a civil corruption trial. 
In February, jurors determined that LaPierre, 74, had diverted millions of dollars from the NRA to live luxuriously, while the organization failed to properly manage its finances and adopt a whistleblower policy. 
Cohen has spent the last two weeks weighing whether to award nonmonetary relief in the second phase of the civil trial.
James sought to permanently bar LaPierre from returning to the lead the NRA or its affiliates. Cohen issued a 10-year ban instead.
The attorney general also wanted the judge to appoint an independent monitor who would oversee the NRA's finances and report to the court for three years, which he did not do.
LaPierre served as the NRA’s CEO and executive vice president for more than 30 years before he announced his resignation at the beginning of January, days before the start of the trial, citing health issues.
 Jurors still found there was cause for his removal from the NRA. They determined he had violated his statutory obligation to discharge the duties of his position in good faith, as did John Frazer, the group’s corporate secretary and former general counsel, and Wilson “Woody” Phillips, the NRA’s former treasurer and chief financial officer.
The jury said that LaPierre had caused $5.4 million in monetary harm to the NRA, but that he has already repaid at least $1 million of that. Phillips caused $2 million in monetary harm to the NRA, the jurors found, while Frazer did not cause any monetary harm to the group.
On Monday, Cohen declined to impose restrictions on Frazer.
Before the second phase of the trial began, the parties reached a stipulation agreement on the appropriate remedy for Phillips.
Phillips, who is retired, will be prohibited from holding fiduciary positions with any New York nonprofit for 10 years. After a decade, he can resume serving if he first notifies the attorney general’s office and completes a training program.
He will still have to pay $2 million in damages, the attorney general said.
During oral arguments in June, LaPierre’s attorney, P. Kent Correll, argued against banning LaPierre from working for the NRA or its affiliates.
Correll said that LaPierre was retired and “not coming back” to the NRA but that LaPierre wants to “keep his right to associate freely with whomever he wants and to speak freely.”
Attorneys for the NRA, LaPierre and Frazer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The NRA had fought against the independent monitor, saying the attorney general could not show that the NRA had continued violating any laws.
The group said it had fired those who took advantage of it and ushered in a fresh slate of leaders, including a new chief compliance officer, an internal auditor and a president.
In May, the organization replaced Frazer as general counsel, although he was re-elected to serve as corporate secretary, the NRA said.
The NRA has operated as a nonprofit charitable corporation in New York since 1871. Its assets are required by law to be used in a way that serves the interests of its membership and advances its charitable mission.
NRA membership dues and contributions have drastically fallen in the last few years, court records show. 
Dues dropped from about $170 million in 2018 to nearly $62 million in 2023, according to a court exhibit that contains the NRA’s audited financial statements. Contributions were nearly cut in half in that period.Melissa Chan is a reporter for NBC News Digital with a focus on veterans’ issues, mental health in the military and gun violence."

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner of the country's presidential election on Sunday after securing more than 50% of the vote, although the opposition contends that the results are not accurate.
The National Electoral Council said at around midnight that Maduro received 51% of the vote, while the main opposition candidate, Edmundo González, had 44% support, according to The Associated Press.
Elvis Amoroso, head of the National Electoral Council, said the results were based on 80% of voting stations and represented an irreversible trend.
Despite Maduro being declared the winner of a third term, the opposition claimed victory, setting up a showdown with the government over the results.

The electoral authority, controlled by Maduro loyalists, did not immediately publish the results from each of the 30,000 polling booths across the country, impeding the opposition's ability to challenge the results after alleging it only had data for about 30% of the ballot boxes.
""The Venezuelans and the entire world know what happened,"" González said.
Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado claimed González's margin of victory was ""overwhelming."" Machado said the opposition had voting results from about 40% of ballot boxes across the country and that more were expected overnight.
Officials and lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere expressed skepticism about the validity of Venezuela's presidential election results after Maduro was declared the victor.
Speaking in Tokyo, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. has ""serious concerns"" about the announced outcome.
Blinken said the U.S. feared the result did not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people, and called for election officials to immediately release the full results. He also said the U.S. and the international community would respond accordingly.

FOX_2,Trump's legal wins seem to simplify upcoming general election campaign schedule,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-legal-victories-help-uncomplicate-general-election-campaign-schedule,2024-07-29 16:01:02.826759,politics,"'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier provides details on the former president's reaction to Judge Aileen Cannon's decision to dismiss his classified documents case in Florida. 
Former President Trump has had a number of legal victories in recent weeks, putting a pause on a majority of cases that could have complicated his campaigning during the general election season. 
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. United States that a former president has substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts in office but not for unofficial acts. The high court said Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for ""official acts"" but left it to the lower court to determine exactly where the line between official and unofficial is.
""The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,"" the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts states. ""That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.""
The question of presidential immunity stemmed from special counsel Jack Smith’s Jan. 6 case against Trump. Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges. That trial was put on hold in a lower court pending the Supreme Court’s ruling, which wiped out any charges related to official presidential acts.

The Supreme Court’s ruling then prompted Trump's lawyers to request that the former president’s sentencing be delayed in New York v. Trump. He was found guilty on all counts of falsifying business records in the first degree after an unprecedented criminal trial stemming from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation. 
TRUMP TOUTS SUPREME COURT'S PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY RULING AS 'BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND FOR DEMOCRACY'
The sentencing was originally scheduled for July 11, before the Republican National Convention, where Trump would eventually be formally nominated as the GOP presidential nominee. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to delay and said a hearing on the matter would take place Sept. 18.

But days later, Trump's lawyers asked Merchan to overturn the former president’s guilty verdict in New York v. Trump.
Trump attorneys cited the Supreme Court ruling, saying the court should ""dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury’s verdict based on violations of the Presidential immunity doctrine and the Supremacy Clause."" In the formal motion, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche pointed to the Supreme Court’s immunity decision and argued certain evidence of ""official acts"" should not have been admitted during the trial.

Specifically, Blanche argued that testimony from former White House officials and employees was inappropriately admitted during trial.

Blanche argued Bragg ""violated the Presidential immunity doctrine by using similar official-acts evidence in the grand jury proceedings that gave rise to the politically motivated charges in this case."" 
A ruling on the motion is pending. 
JUDGE DISMISSES TRUMP'S FLORIDA CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CASE
Days later, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed special counsel Jack Smith’s classified records case against Trump. 
Trump had faced charges related to alleged improper retention of classified records at Mar-a-Lago. He pleaded not guilty to all 37 felony counts from Smith’s probe, including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements. 
But Cannon dismissed the case altogether, ruling Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded, citing the Appointments Clause in the Constitution.

The Appointments Clause states, ""Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States be appointed by the President subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, although Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" Smith, however, was never confirmed by the Senate.
Smith is appealing the ruling. 
TRUMP APPEALS $454M NY CIVIL FRAUD JUDGMENT
Meanwhile, in Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis had charged Trump related to alleged 2020 election interference. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. 
Federal Judge Aileen Cannon  (U.S. Courts )
The judge in that case dismissed six of the charges against Trump, saying Willis failed to allege sufficient detail. 
The case also was thrown into limbo when it was revealed Willis reportedly had an ""improper affair"" with Nathan Wade, a prosecutor she hired to help bring the case against Trump. Wade was later removed. 
Last month, the Georgia Court of Appeals paused the proceedings until it hears the case to disqualify Willis in October, yet another major setback for Willis.

Last week, the Georgia Court of Appeals said it would hear Trump’s argument to have Willis disqualified on Dec. 5, a month after the 2024 presidential election. 
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruling could be applied by Trump attorneys in several civil cases he has been fighting. 
In the civil defamation case brought against him by columnist E. Jean Carroll, Trump was ordered to pay more than $83 million in damages after he denied allegations he raped her in the 1990s.

Carroll alleged Trump raped her at the Bergdorf Goodman department store across from Trump Tower in Manhattan in 1996. 
The jury found Carroll was injured as a result of statements Trump made while in the White House in June 2019. 
Trump’s denial came while he was president during a press gaggle at the White House. Trump attorneys could say the denial came as part of an official presidential act.

(@SteveGuest on X)
Vice President Harris has stated that President Biden is completely fit to finish his term and serve another, despite his debate and interview performances, after having had more than 80 publicly documented encounters over the past year, a Fox News Digital investigation found.
From July 18, 2023, to July 17, 2024, Harris, who is now the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate now that Biden has dropped out, shared at least 25 meetings, eight lunches and 46 events with the president, and they spent two times traveling together. That makes Harris one of the people most capable of speaking to the president's mental acuity.
Those dozens of meetings are also only the ones listed on public schedules. Not everything the president or vice president does is listed on these, such as time spent in the Situation Room, where Biden and Harris attend briefings together. They likely would have done so after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel, for example.
After Biden’s stumbling and stalled debate performance against former President Trump in Atlanta this past June, Harris sat down with CNN’s Anderson Cooper to try to hold the line for the commander in chief. 
""Yes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish. And what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people on substance, on policy, on performance. Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong,"" Harris said last month. ""I'm not going to spend all night with you talking about the last 90 minutes when I've been watching the last 3.5 years of performance.""
KAMALA HARRIS SPENT MONTHS SHOOTING DOWN CONCERNS OVER BIDEN'S MENTAL COMPETENCY

Harris earlier this year decried Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report that described Biden as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" as nothing but ""gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate"" criticism. But the June 27 debate publicly put Biden’s mental fitness on display, sending vulnerable Democrats in Congress and the donor class into a tailspin over the viability of the aging president’s candidacy.
Biden, who had been self-isolating with a reported case of COVID-19, announced on July 21 via a letter posted on X that he would no longer seek a second term and endorsed Harris as the presidential nominee.   
Harris, however, spent months before the debate defending Biden’s mental competency after a series of gaffes and public trips and falls.
In November, Harris was confronted at the New York Times Dealbook Summit about how former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Biden was confused and needed cue cards during debt negotiations.
""I would say that age is more than a chronological fact. I spend a whole lot of time with our president, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room and in other places. And I can tell you, as I just mentioned, not only is he absolutely authoritative in rooms around the globe but in the Oval Office, meeting with members of Congress, meeting with leaders in industry, meeting with community leaders,"" Harris responded.

""Only one person sits behind the Resolute Desk,"" she added. ""I’m not lying … I’m telling … but I’m telling you a fact.""
The Justice Department report by Hur released in February found Biden ""willfully"" retained and disclosed classified information to a ghostwriter but did not recommend criminal charges. Hur said Biden displayed ""limited faculties"" and described his memory as ""significantly limited"" during interviews with the special counsel’s office, noting the president could not remember ""even within several years"" when his son, Beau, died.
At an event on the White House grounds dedicated to discussing gun violence, Harris insisted that ""the way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated, gratuitous,"" adding that ""when it comes to the role and responsibility of a prosecutor in a situation like that, we should expect that there would be a higher level of integrity than what we saw.""

It was then that Harris described the ""countless hours"" she spent with Biden and the secretaries of defense and state and the leaders of the intelligence community after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists.""The president was in front of and on top of it all,"" Harris told reporters in February, ""asking questions and requiring that America's military and intelligence community and diplomatic community would figure out to know how many people were dead, how many are Americans, how many hostages, is the situation stable?""

As the nation focused on the implosion of President Biden's candidacy beginning last month, legacy media organizations jumped on a conservative group's plan they warn will be implemented in a hypothetical second term for former President Trump.
Project 2025, also known as the Presidential Transition Project and launched in April 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, is widely described as a conservative blueprint for a future Republican administration to overhaul various parts of the federal government. Trump has distanced himself from it, calling elements of the plan as ""ridiculous"" and ""abysmal,"" but liberal pundits insist a vote for Trump is a vote for Project 2025.
Despite Project 2025 being in the public domain for more than 15 months, liberal media outlets trained an especially intense spotlight on it following Biden's infamous debate debacle, which was also when Democrats and their media allies embraced it as an anti-Trump talking point.

Within 25 days, from June 1 to June 26, the day before the debate, Project 2025 was mentioned on CNN 36 times, according to Grabien transcripts, including reruns. But in the days following the debate from June 28 to July 24, CNN mentioned it a whopping 463 times. 
MSNBC had already allotted ample coverage to Project 2025, mentioning it 288 times in the 25 days leading up to the debate, according to transcripts. But after the debate, MSNBC mentioned it an astonishing 1,614 times in less than a month, in near-uniformly negative fashion.
The New York Times made reference to Project 2025 seven times during the same time period pre-debate, according to its website's search results. After the debate, Project 2025 yielded 75 search results on the Gray Lady's website. 
ABC News' ""Good Morning America,"" ""The View"" and ""World News Tonight"" had only mentioned Project 2025 three times prior to the debate but have sounded the alarm 29 times since, while morning and evening newscasts on NBC and CBS have mentioned Project 2025 a handful of times since the debate after previously ignoring it.

Heritage Foundation public relations director Noah Weinrich feels the left is using Project 2025 to distract voters. 
""It's no surprise that the Harris-Biden regime and allies in the left-wing media have ramped up their false attacks on Project 2025 since Biden's disastrous debate. They can't run on their failed policies, so to distract the American people they are lying about what's in Project 2025 and lying that we are connected to President Trump,"" Weinrich told Fox News Digital. 
""Project 2025 is entirely independent from the Trump campaign, and it doesn't recommend the extremist proposals the left pretends it does,"" Weinrich continued. ""This whole news cycle is fake news at its best."" 
KAMALA HARRIS TARGETS TRUMP, VANCE AND PROJECT 2025 IN NC CAMPAIGN STOP
Project 2025 received roughly 63 media mentions per day during an entire year leading up to the debate, ranging from June 27, 2023 through June 27, 2024, according to Heritage Foundation internal research. The group found that media mentions of Project 2025 ballooned to 1,840 per day from the June 27 debate through July 25. 
Google Trend also shows a significant spike in Project 2025 interest since Biden’s debate meltdown, which set off a chain reaction that led to him not seeking a second term and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. Both Biden and Harris have repeatedly lambasted it on social media.
Radio host Jason Rantz has noticed the significant uptick in Project 2025 coverage.
""The so-called threat of Project 2025 is being used by Democrats to fearmonger about Donald Trump because it sounds scary, so naturally left-wing media will amplify the lies about it to help Kamala Harris,"" Rantz told Fox News Digital. 
""The media reluctantly destroyed Joe Biden after they couldn't cover for him anymore. They didn't force him out of honest and fair reporting. They went after him because he couldn't beat Donald Trump,"" Rantz continued. ""Left-wing media has a singular mission when Trump is involved: keep him out of office. They see the Project 2025 smear as a winning strategy.""
The rhetoric surrounding Project 2025, a brainchild of several conservative groups, as well as Trump allies and former Trump administration officials, has been extreme. 
When Trump selected JD Vance as his running mate, CNN’s Van Jones called him a ""scary dude"" who would help implement the plan. 
This graph shows media mentions of Project 2025 from NBC, ABC and CBS. (Fox News/Canva)
""If you’re worried about the Project 2025 and all type of stuff, this is a guy that’s going to really keep you up at night,"" Jones told CNN viewers. 
MSNBC’s Joy Reid said she’d vote for a Biden ""in a coma"" if Trump was the alternative before evoking Project 2025. 
""Yeah, Hitler, White House, we’re keeping him out. We’re keeping Project 2025 out — that’s all I care about,"" Reid said.
Harris has embraced the Project 2025 talking points since Biden stepped aside and left her as the presumptive Democratic nominee. The Biden-Harris campaigns and their media allies have said it will ""rip away women’s freedom,"" lead to mass deportation of Latinos and ""undermine"" democracy, among other things. 
""Their plans are extreme, and they are divisive,"" Harris recently said after tying Project 2025 to Trump and Vance. 
EVEN SCARY DARTH VADER WON'T HELP DEMS PROJECT 2025 FEAR MONGERING
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote that the plan offers ""many things to object to"" and that it ""basically calls for replacing much of the federal work force, which consists mainly of career civil servants somewhat insulated from partisan pressures, with political appointees who can be hired or fired at will.""
""It’s all too easy to imagine an unscrupulous president using the power this would give him to reward friends and punish opponents across the nation,"" Krugman wrote. 
""For now, let’s just say that it’s every bit as menacing as critics report,"" he continued. ""And despite Trump’s disingenuous attempts to distance himself from the project, it gives us a very good idea of what a second Trump term could be like.""
Even after Trump began to distance himself from Project 2025, MSNBC host Katie Phang flatly called it the ""blueprint"" for a second Trump administration.
""It’s a far-right plan for destroying democracy that Trump’s team wants to implement on day one,"" ABC ""The VIew"" co-host Joy Behar said earlier this month. 
""Let me count the ways: They want to ban abortion, starve school children, [eliminate] breakfast and lunch for school kids, they want to have mass deportations of immigrants, they want to gut healthcare, this is all just for starters,"" Behar continued. ""This is part of their platform … it’s the blueprint for a fascist regime."" 
Before Biden was forced off the ticket, fellow ""View"" co-host Sunny Hostin said rather than throwing him ""under the bus,"" Democrats should be focused on Project 2025.
""Democrats … need to start talking more about the Republican program which is Project 2025,"" she said. ""I implore all of you who have not read it – it is 900 pages, it is not the easiest thing to get through, but it is the scariest thing you will ever read."" 
FLASHBACK: BIDEN BEING REPLACED ON TICKET WAS 'FANTASY' DISMISSED BY MEDIA
Trump disavowed Project 2025 as it began making headlines, while his media critics have noted more than 100 Trump administration officials had a hand in its creation.
""I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.""
Trump's campaign also took aim at the attempts to tie him to Project 2025, previously telling Fox News Digital that Agenda 47 and President Trump’s RNC Platform are the only policies endorsed by Trump for a second term.
""Team Biden and the DNC are LYING and fear-mongering because they have NOTHING else to offer the American people. Remember this is the same group that lied to Americans and hid Joe Biden’s cognitive decline all these years,"" a Trump campaign spokesperson said. 
In reaction, Project 2025 said it does not speak for Trump. 
""As we’ve been saying for more than two years now, Project 2025 does not speak for any candidate or campaign,"" a Project 2025 spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital. ""We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president. But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement.""
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

With Vice President Kamala Harris appearing to be the candidate that the Democrats are consolidating around, it is easy to become mired in her quirks. The temptation is to focus on anything from her awkward speeches to her professed love for Venn Diagrams.  
While there is plenty of material with which to work around the vice president, this isn’t going to be a winning strategy. By focusing on her personally, that will be playing right into the Democratic strategy of highlighting who she is instead of her policies and track record.  
Democrats will solely be focusing on a cult of personality and making the election historic — a vote for her would be a vote for the first woman president, among other firsts. That’s what they want the election to be about and will use that to mobilize their voters. If the GOP makes Harris’s personal attributes its focus, it will be keeping the focus exactly where the Democrats want.

It is very clear that President Joe Biden hasn't been the one running the country, probably for his entire presidency.  
Whoever has been pulling the strings has now jockeyed behind-the-scenes to put Kamala in place.  
If voters haven’t been happy with the policies and outcomes of the last three-and-a-half years, they shouldn’t expect a change for the better just because they changed out the puppet. 
That should be the messaging, plain and simple. 
Vice President Harris, who has received no primary votes in any presidential election, is no doubt going to be beholden to whomever has anointed her the chosen candidate. This means the policies that the Democrats’ ""system"" has been enacting, from allowing millions of illegal aliens into the country to wreaking economic and fiscal havoc, from massive inflation and the struggle for Americans to afford their basic needs, to running massive non-emergency deficits, will remain in place. 
Are you sick of America’s counterproductive energy policies? Well, get ready for another four years of pushing destructive faux ""green policies."" Do you hate how we have shown weakness on the international stage that has emboldened terrorists around the world? Be prepared for more of the same. 
Biden was positioned to America as a moderate candidate, and it was apparent very quickly that was not the case. His policies have led to making life for most Americans significantly worse, not better.  
Kamala will not be a moderate, she will be at best Joe Biden 2.0.

In the past, VP Harris has been influenced by the socialists among the Democratic Party. She had been one of the Senate co-sponsors of the original Green New Deal bill, filled with a socialist wish list of every bad socialist policy imaginable and a price tag that was unimaginable. 
Her VP track record, including as the White House point person on immigration and the border, hasn’t produced any comforting results.

Vice President Kamala Harris has never been closer to becoming president of the United States. And if she succeeds in that endeavor in November, her administration would likely be the most socialist and destructive in our country’s history. 
The Biden-Harris administration has been nothing short of a complete disaster. Under the leadership of President Joe Biden and Harris, Americans have experienced soaring levels of government debt and inflation. Housing has never been more expensive. Families are becoming increasingly more dependent on government to survive. Europe and the Middle East are now embroiled in deadly conflicts after four years of stability under former President Donald Trump. 
As bad as things have been with Biden as president, however, putting Harris in charge would make life substantially worse. Biden has been one of America’s most progressive presidents, but Harris’s past policy positions are even further to the left of those backed by Biden.  
TRUMP QUICKLY MOVES TO DEFINE HARRIS AS 'MORE LEFT THAN BERNIE SANDERS'
In fact, if Harris were to become president, it’s fair to say that she would be the first democratic socialist candidate to fill the position in the 248-year history of the United States. 
Vice President Kamala Harris has moved into the top spot on the Democrat ticket and that makes her socialist policies even scarier. (Fox News)
I have listed below two of the most socialist legislative proposals backed by Harris. Together, they feature more than 10 different radical policies. If they were enacted, they would crush the U.S. economy and reduce individual liberty in unprecedented ways. 
The best and clearest example of Harris’s socialist views is her commitment to the Green New Deal, one of the most far-reaching, costly proposals offered in American history. 
The Green New Deal, which was spearheaded by self-described socialist New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, included a long list of collectivist and economically destructive policies, including ending the use of gasoline-powered cars, oil, natural gas, and other reliable energy sources — all in just 10 years. 
The Green New Deal also called for a massive new infrastructure plan, including a nationwide network of high-speed rail, ""basic income"" programs, a government jobs guarantee, ""upgrading all existing buildings in the United States,"" the creation of a system of public banks, rebuilding the electric grid, trillions in wind and solar development, and the transformation of U.S. agriculture, including an end to much of the cattle industry. 
The Green New Deal also called for a single-payer health care plan. 
Harris was one of the Green New Deal’s biggest supporters and one of only 14 senators to co-sponsor the plan when it was introduced in the Senate in 2019, along with other socialist-leaning politicians like Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren. 
Harris was such a fan of the Green New Deal that she even suggested changing Senate rules to make it easier to ram it through the legislative process. 
The GND would shove the country toward socialism, and in so doing, set it up for a full-blown economic catastrophe.

The energy provisions of the plan are particularly worrisome. America’s economy depends on affordable, dependable energy sources like natural gas. Imposing a reckless transition to costly, less reliable forms of energy like wind and solar, especially over a short period, would be disastrous for America’s economic development. 
Not only that, but the GND’s estimated cost range tops out at $94 trillion, according to the American Action Forum, a price tag that would require substantially more money-printing, taxes and debt. 
If Harris has it her way and the Green New Deal becomes law, it would cause taxes and inflation to skyrocket well beyond what most families can afford. It would also limit consumer choices and destroy entire fossil-fuel-related industries, along with the many jobs that they provide. 
Biden has been staunchly opposed to Medicare for All plans like those supported by Bernie Sanders, but when Harris ran for the Democrat presidential nomination in 2019, she made the socialist policy one of the key parts of her policy agenda. 
Under the Harris Medicare for All proposal, newborns and uninsured would automatically be enrolled in a government-run health care plan, and those with employer-sponsored insurance would be phased into the plan over 10 years. Eventually, almost everyone would be stuck with government health coverage.

Harris would allow for a narrow range of private health insurance, but those plans would be supplemental to Medicare for All, tightly regulated, and would be required to ""adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits."" 
Medicare for All plans like Harris’s would effectively force everyone with quality coverage into an inferior, government-run program. And because Medicare reimbursement rates are much lower than private health insurance, healthcare providers would need to slash the quality of services provided just to break even. 
Sooner or later, providers or the government will likely turn to rationing care to manage costs, as they do now in many European nations that have government-run health care systems. That means longer wait times and reduced access to care for most Americans. 
If Harris has it her way and the Green New Deal becomes law, it would cause taxes and inflation to skyrocket well beyond what most families can afford. It would also limit consumer choices and destroy entire fossil-fuel-related industries, along with the many jobs that they provide. 
Medicare for All would also be extremely expensive, costing tens of trillions of dollars in new government spending. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, which is very similar but not identical to Harris’s version, would cost taxpayers $32 trillion over 10 years. (Most of the major provisions are identical.)

Even worse, for millions of taxpayers, the benefits provided would not outweigh the cost of the additional taxes that would likely need to be imposed to pay for the plan. 
America simply cannot afford Harris’s radical vision for the country. And even if it could, putting the dysfunctional, inefficient, corrupt federal government in charge of virtually every part of our lives, from health care to the kinds of cars we can drive, should be avoided at all costs.

FOX_9,Kamala Harris made a career of pretending to be marginalized,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-made-career-pretending-marginalized,2024-07-29 19:01:02.981227,politics,"MSNBC senior political analyst Matthew Dowd rejected veteran Democratic strategist James Carville's warnings about celebrating Kamala Harris' candidacy too early. 
Since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, the House Republican leadership has instructed its members to keep quiet about a most glaring Harris weakness: the repulsive identity politics that catapulted her to the White House.  
As then-candidate Biden proudly proclaimed in 2020, he picked Harris as his running mate because she is a Black woman. Biden’s submission to the gender and racial preferences at the heart of the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) agenda was a brazen attack on merit, and the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, a few weeks ago offers a poignant reminder of the perils of hiring the unqualified.  
Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who recently resigned under pressure, famously focused not on fitness for the job, but on sex, vowing to achieve 30% female recruits for the Secret Service by 2030. As videos from the Trump rally in Butler show, multiple female agents were obviously far too short to shield the 6’3"" Trump with their bodies, and some handled their weapons clumsily.  
CBS STATION SLAPPED WITH COMMUNITY NOTE AFTER CLAIMING TRUMP MISLED ABOUT HARRIS-BACKED BAIL FUND
In the aftermath of this tragedy, hiring based on woke criteria such as sex or ethnicity has rightly come under ridicule. This practice deserves even higher scrutiny when the highest office of the land is at stake.  
Vice President Kamala Harris has a history of taking far-left positions on issues. FILE: Harris kicked off her ""Fight for Our Freedoms"" tour through colleges across the United States. 
Harris — who has never won a single vote in an open election as a presidential candidate — not only introduces herself with ""my pronouns are,"" but is also the No. 1 advocate of ""equity"" in the Biden administration.  
Harris and most Democrats in charge around the country have now, perversely, decreed racial equality — the great achievement of the civil rights movement — to be racist. What matters is no longer equal opportunity, but equal outcome. As Harris herself announced on social media in the 2020 election, only ""equity"" — meaning, the same results for everyone — will do. 
Biden bought into this grotesque ideology when he pledged to only pick a Black woman as a running mate, and that he would prioritize appointing Black women to high positions — each time the focus being on ""woman"" and ""Black,"" not on qualifications, experience or competence. Thanks to this ""equity,"" the country has a female Supreme Court justice who cannot say what a woman is.  
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The pernicious ideology of racial equity is also the animating force behind reparations, racial preferences, critical race theory taught to children at schools and the defund-the-police movement. Harris herself promoted bail funds for BLM rioters in 2020.  
As with any DEI hire, incompetence is the likely result, and incompetence is what Harris has delivered.  
As Biden’s ""border czar,"" she oversaw (perched far from the Southern border), the invasion of nearly 10 million illegal aliens from around the world and counting. 
Skyrocketing inflation, out-of-control crime, or the fentanyl epidemic? Americans cannot think of a single contribution from Harris in addressing these serious issues in the past three-and-a-half years.

The pernicious ideology of racial equity is also the animating force behind reparations, racial preferences, critical race theory taught to children at schools and the defund-the-police movement. Harris herself promoted bail funds for BLM rioters in 2020.  
Nor can they point to any Harris accomplishments in foreign policy. From Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing war on Ukraine that threatens to engulf major parts of Europe, the Iranian mullahs’ open declaration to literally destroy Israel and then the United States, and a bellicose China growing ever more impatient with the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Harris has shown no proficiency in confronting aggression and war around the world. When Americans look to their current vice president, they see not strength or wisdom but the vapid self-congratulations of DEI ideology.
Kamala Harris, born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who met at the University of California at Berkeley (one of America’s top universities), has made a lucrative career of pretending to be marginalized. If Harris does, in fact, become the Democratic presidential nominee in August, American voters should reject her and the moral bankruptcy of the DEI ideology that brought her to national prominence. This DEI candidate has no business being president of the United States, and Republicans should not be afraid to say so.

JERUSALEM – The looming Israeli response against the Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorist movement in Lebanon is said to be imminent in response to the group’s rocket attack on a children’s soccer field on Saturday, resulting in the murders of 12 young people. 
Early Monday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reportedly executed a drone strike in southern Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of two Hezbollah terrorists. The IDF has not commented on the strike. The IDF drone attacks came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a three-hour cabinet meeting on Sunday, during which ministers authorized the prime minister and his minister of defense to determine the ""manner and timing"" of a military response to the lethal Hezbollah attack.
Danny Danon, Israel's new ambassador to the United Nations, told ""Fox and Friends"" host Steve Doocy on Monday that, Israel's ""response will be swift, harsh and painful, and we are now picking the targets and I believe in the next few days, and I'm sure Hezbollah will learn their lesson."" He also said Israel had no ""intentions of a full war."" 
NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED'

U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday.
 ""The Secretary reaffirmed the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iranian-backed terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah. He emphasized the importance of preventing escalation of the conflict and discussed efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to allow citizens on both sides of the border between Israel and Lebanon to return home,"" Miller said.
The Jerusalem Post reported that French President Emmanuel Macron told Netanyahu that France was ""fully committed to doing everything possible to avoid new escalation in the region by sending messages to all parties in the conflict."" France, in contrast to other major European powers, Germany and Britain, has not classified Hezbollah’s entire movement as a terrorist entity. Israel and the U.S. have urged France to designate Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
Air France has suspended flights to and from Beirut due to the expectation a major war will unfold. German airline Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines and Eurowings have also suspended flights.

Israel's Druze community is still reeling from the shocking violence carried out by Hezbollah. 
The scenes on Sunday were ones of sadness, shock and devastation as the residents of the mostly Druze village of Majdal Shams buried the young victims of the Hezbollah rocket attack that killed at least 12 and injured some 29 others - mostly ages between 10 and 20 as many of them innocently played soccer on Saturday.
The Druze trace their ancestry back to the Biblical figure Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze serve in senior positions in public and military life, and the bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the ""covenant of blood."" The Druze speak Arabic but are not Muslim and are very secretive about their religious beliefs, according to the TPS news agency.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday in Japan, Blinken said ""I emphasize (Israel's) right to defend its citizens and our determination to make sure that they're able to do that,"" ""But we also don't want to see the conflict escalate. We don't want to see it spread,"" according to Reuters.
Blinken also said he was in talks with the U.S. and all but confirmed that it was Hezbollah that fired the rocket from Lebanon. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said on Sunday, ""This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah. It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control. It should be universally condemned.""

The failure to identify the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah as the perpetrator of the Saturday massacre in the X post of the American Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew sparked criticism on the social media platform on Sunday.
David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, wrote in response to Lew’s message on X, ""If I didn’t know better by your statement, it appears the attack kind of spontaneously happened by an evil missile acting on its own.""
The European Union’s foreign policy head, Josep Borrell, faced similar criticism for not pinning the blame on Hezbollah for its use of an Iranian rocket to murder children.
During an operational briefing on Sunday, Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said of Hezbollah that ""despite their ridiculous denials … they will bear a heavy price for their actions.""

Hezbollah-linked media was first to report Hezbollah’s boasting about the attack, only for the terror group to later claim it was not them who did it once the barbarity of the attack became clear. The Israelis put the blame squarely on the U.S.-designated terrorist group.
The IDF said approximately 30 projectiles were identified crossing into Israel from Lebanon on Saturday. The U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah is the de facto ruler over Lebanon. 
HEZBOLLAH BOMBARDS ISRAEL WITH ROCKETS, DRONES
Israel’s TPS news agency reported that the IDF raised its readiness for war. During a tour of the area, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said, ""We are greatly increasing our readiness for the next stage of fighting in the north, as we are simultaneously fighting in Gaza. We know how to attack even very far from the State of Israel. There will be more challenges, we will raise our readiness.
""We know exactly where the rocket was launched from. We examined here on the wall of the soccer field the remains of the rocket, and we know to say that it is a Falaq rocket with a 53-kilogram warhead. This is a Hezbollah rocket. And whoever fires such a rocket into an urban area wants to kill civilians, wants to kill children,"" Halevi said.

FDD Iran Senior Fellow Behnam Ben Taleblu said the rocket came from Iran, ""There should be no surprise that the munition Hezbollah fired at Israel is Iranian in design and origin. After all, when Iranian officials say death to Israel, they mean it. The weapon used in the latest attack is a spin-stabilized artillery rocket called the Falaq-1, which has a range of 10km while carrying a 50kg warhead.""

FOX_13,'Doubleheader' meteor shower to light up the sky this week: Here's how to catch a glimpse,https://www.foxnews.com/science/doubleheader-meteor-shower-light-sky-week-catch-glimpse,2024-07-29 21:39:02.667472,world,"A meteor was recently spotted in Broomfield, Colorado. The rare fireballs were recorded by multiple residents in the area. See the moment!
Get ready for a meteor shower doubleheader.
The Southern Delta Aquariid meteor shower peaks in late July. And this year, it will coincide with a second smaller meteor shower, the Alpha Capricornids.
The Delta Aquariids occur every year in North America's late summer. This year’s peak activity happens early Tuesday morning, with an expected 15 to 20 meteors visible per hour in the Northern Hemisphere, under dark skies. Viewing should be even better in the Southern Hemisphere. The shower lasts through August 21, according to the American Meteor Society.

Around the same time, the Alpha Capricornid meteor shower should produce around five meteors per hour and lasts through August 15.

This year, the Southern Delta Aquariid meteor shower, peaking in late July, will coincide with the smaller Alpha Capricornid meteor shower. The next major meteor shower will be the Perseids, peaking in mid-August. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)
Here’s what to know about the Delta Aquariids and other meteor showers.
Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don’t need special equipment to see them.
Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Delta Aquariids is thought to be from the comet 96P/Machholz. The Alpha Capricornids originate from the comet 169P/NEAT.
When rocks from space enter Earth’s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them — the end of a ""shooting star.""
The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.
These two meteor showers are not high volume, but the Alpha Capricornids often produces very bright meteors, said University of Warwick astronomer Don Pollacco.
For skygazers, ""one bright one is worth 20 faint ones,"" he said.
Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.
It’s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.
And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren't checking your phone. ""It ruins your night vision,"" said NASA's Bill Cooke.
The Southern Hemisphere will have the best view of Delta Aquariids. Coinciding with a waning moon around 30% full means the clearest viewing will happen after midnight.

The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.
The next major meteor shower will be the Perseids, peaking in mid-August."

Italy and China signed a three-year action plan on Sunday to implement past agreements and experiment with new forms of cooperation, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on an official visit to the Chinese capital.
Meloni is trying to reset relations with China as fears of a trade war with the European Union are interwoven with continued interest in attracting Chinese investment in auto manufacturing and other sectors.
""We certainly have a lot of work to do and I am convinced that this work can be useful in such a complex phase on a global level, and also important at a multilateral level,"" she said in remarks at the start of a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.
ITALIAN PM MELONI SENDS CONDOLENCES TO FAMILY OF 'HERO' FIREFIGHTER WHO WAS KILLED AT TRUMP RALLY
Her five-day visit comes several months after Italy dropped out of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a signature policy of Chinese leader Xi Jinping to build power and transportation infrastructure around the world to stimulate global trade while also deepening China's ties with other nations.
Still, Italy remains keen to pursue an otherwise strong economic relationship with China. Stellantis, a major automaker that includes Italy’s Fiat, announced in May that it had formed a joint venture with Leapmotor, a Chinese electric car startup, to begin selling EVs in Europe.
Li, addressing Italian and Chinese business leaders after the meeting with Meloni, said that China's push to upgrade its economy will increase demand for high-quality products, expanding opportunities for cooperation between companies from their two countries.

He pledged to open Chinese markets further, ensure that foreign companies get the same treatment as Chinese ones and create a transparent and predictable business environment, responding to frequently heard complaints from businesses operating in the world's second-largest economy.
""At the same time, we hope the Italian side will work with China to provide a more fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies doing business in Italy,"" he said.
Meloni told the business leaders that the two sides had signed an industrial collaboration memorandum that includes electric vehicles and renewable energy, which she described as ""sectors where China has already been operating on the technological frontier for some time ... and is sharing the new frontiers of knowledge with partners.""

Electric vehicles have also become a symbol of growing China-EU trade tensions, with the European Union imposing provisional tariffs of up to 37.6% on China-made electric vehicles in early July. The two sides are holding talks to try to resolve the issue by an early November deadline.
Meanwhile, China launched an anti-dumping investigation into European pork exports, just days after the EU announced it would impose the tariffs on Chinese EVs.
Meloni, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday, is making her first trip to China as prime minister. She has held talks with Li before, meeting in New Delhi last September during the annual G-20 summit, which brings together the leaders of 20 major nations.
Italy's decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative in 2019 appeared to be a political coup for China, giving it an inroad into Western Europe and a symbolic boost in a then-raging trade war with the United States. But Italy says the promised economic benefits didn't materialize, and its membership created friction with other Western European governments and the United States."

Turkey’s leader on Sunday threatened military intervention in Israel to stop Jerusalem’s war in Gaza in a significant escalation of rhetoric from NATO’s second-largest military.
In a meeting with his Justice and Development Party (AKP), President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkey ""must be very strong so that Israel can't do these ridiculous things to Palestine.""
""Just like we entered Karabakh, just like we entered Libya, we might do similar to them,"" he said, according to a Reuters report.

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz came back swinging and suggested Erdoğan would meet a similarly deadly fate as Iraq’s former president, Saddam Hussein, who was executed by hanging in 2006.
""Erdoğan follows in the footsteps of Saddam Hussein and threatens to attack Israel. Just let him remember what happened there and how it ended,"" Katz said in a message posted to X that included a picture of Erdoğan and the former Iraqi leader.

Threats levied by the Turkish president come as Israel faces increasing aggression from Iran-backed Islamic militants, including Hamas, Houthi and Hezbollah terrorist groups. 
Erdoğan did not detail what Turkish military intervention would entail, though he has repeatedly been a harsh critic of the war in Gaza.

""There is no reason why we cannot do this…We must be strong so that we can take these steps,"" Erdogan told AKP party officials.
The Turkish leader appeared to be referring to military action Ankara, capital of Turkey, took in 2020 when it sent troops to defend the U.N.-recognized Government of National Accord of Libya amid its civil war, which first broke out in 2014. 
Turkey has denied direct involvement in Azerbaijan's military action in its Nagorno-Karabakh region, where it claims to be carrying out ""anti-terror"" operations against Armenian rebels. Though in 2023, Ankara reportedly said it was using ""all means"" to support its ally, including through military training.

Josh Shapiro to be her running mate.
The ""Keys to the White House"" are currently favoring Vice President Kamala Harris in a hypothetical 2024 matchup against former President Trump, but a final prediction for the 2024 race is yet to be made.
Allan Lichtman, an election forecaster who has correctly predicted nearly every presidential race since 1984, developed a formula that is used to make predictions about an upcoming presidential election – and in most cases, it proves to be right. 
Lichtman's ""Keys to the White House"" consists of 13 true or false questions that he believes establish a strong indication of who will be named the victor on the fall ballot. Each question is asked about the two dueling nominees; if ""true"" they are given a ""key,"" and if ""false,"" their competitor receives the point. Then, if one party's candidate receives six or more keys, they are the predicted winner.
At the beginning of the cycle, Democrats were handed one automatic ""key"" for President Biden's incumbency – but the ballot has since seen a dramatic shift.

The ""keys"" are as follows: – party mandate– contest– incumbency– third party– short-term economy– long-term economy– policy change, – social unrest– scandal– foreign/military failure– foreign/military success– incumbent charisma– challenger charisma
Democrats, with Harris being the likely nominee, currently hold six of the 13 keys, according to Lichtman's prediction. These include primary contest, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, no scandal, and no challenger charisma.
HARRIS VS. TRUMP: 100 DAYS FROM ELECTION, IT'S A DRAMATICALLY ALTERED PRESIDENTIAL RACE
Republicans hold three keys: winning the House majority in the 2022 midterms, the current incumbent not seeking re-election, and the current incumbent lacking charisma.

There are still four more keys that have yet to be handed out. 
The remaining keys include the third party factor, which Lichtman says is notable given Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s place in the race.
Keys are also still in the air for having ""no social unrest,"" as well as ""foreign military failure"" and ""foreign military success.""
If Democrats lose three more keys, then they would be the projected ""losers,"" according to the election prognosticator's formula.

FOX_19,The growing threat behind Biden's Supreme Court proposal,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/growing-threat-behind-bidens-supreme-court-proposal,2024-07-29 23:00:02.902718,opinion,"Constitutional law attorney Katie Cherkasky on the Biden White House's proposal to reform the Supreme Court.
Following his address last week to the nation explaining why he is dropping out of the race, President Joe Biden doubled down on his proposal to ""reform"" the Supreme Court of the United States.
Americans need to understand that the campaign to radically change the Court is coming.  While current proposals like term limits for the longest-serving justices and an imposed code of ethics threaten the Constitution and the separation of powers, the far left is demanding that Court be packed with additional liberal justices.  Whoever the Democrat nominee for President is, if they win, that is exactly what will happen, and it only takes a majority vote and the signature of the President.
In fact, presumptive nominee VP Kamala Harris, who received Biden’s wholehearted endorsement, has already expressed support, stating she was ""absolutely open"" to court packing.
Transforming the Supreme Court into another partisan body would destroy the independence of the judiciary and threaten the civil liberties of all Americans.  Concerning such an idea, then-Senator Biden once said that changing the structure of the Court was ""a bonehead idea"" that would ""put in question … the independence of the … Supreme Court.""  He was right.  The last thing we need in this country right now is a Supreme Court coup that would threaten our democratic republic.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The left continues these moves to take over the Supreme Court because they are angry about recent decisions that have not gone their way.  In truth, the actual numbers do not back up the hysterical claims of a ""partisan Court.""  In the recent term, 45.8 percent of cases were unanimous.  Of the 22 cases decided 6-3, only 11 were along ideological lines. The left is just upset by a small number of cases with which they disagree, and they are willing to take down the Court and the rule of law to get their way.
The Supreme Court is the only branch of government that stands in the way of one-party rule. 
BIDEN, HARRIS CALL FOR SUPREME COURT TERM LIMITS, CODE OF CONDUCT, LIMITS ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY
If the Court packers somehow succeed, the current hyper-partisan political culture will seem like some golden age of political comity.  Civil liberties, particularly religious liberty, across the fifty states will be granted only at the pleasure of the radical left.  First Amendment rights for political opponents will be trampled. 
In truth, ""court reform"" is nothing more than a desperate attack to subvert the legitimacy of the Supreme Court because it contains a majority of justices committed to the Constitution and originalism. If this coup succeeds, the rule of law will be over as the judiciary will become little more than a political tool of whomever holds power.
Violating the Constitution and fundamental principles of separation of powers, ""ethics reform"" is an attempt to give enemies of the judiciary the power to punish justices who rule against the left’s agenda by subjecting them to investigations and fabricated scandals.  The ""term limits"" proposal would require an amendment to the Constitution and is intentionally designed as a partisan move to purge the Supreme Court of conservative justices, immediately removing the longest-serving and most conservative justices first, including textualists Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
President Biden said the Supreme Court's Monday ruling on presidential immunity ""undermines the rule of law of this nation."" (Getty Images)
Congress has no business interfering with the actions of the judiciary.  It is the separation of powers into three district branches of government that makes our nation strong. To protect religious freedom and all of our cherished liberties, judges must be able to make decisions without fear of partisan retribution from the executive or legislative branches.  Biden and Harris’ ""court reform"" would destroy that.
Thankfully, the reasonable majority of Americans fed up with the aggressive, woke left reject all of these dangerous attacks on our Court and the rule of law.

Polling from 2023 reveals that 91% of Americans believe an independent judiciary is a crucial safeguard of our civil liberties, 72% of Americans believe the politicization of the Supreme Court threatens judicial independence, and 68% oppose court-packing.
In Federalist 48, James Madison said that the ""most difficult task is to provide some practical security for each [branch of government], against the invasion of the others.""  He recognized the Court as a critical check on legislative power, which he feared would tend to draw all into its ""impetuous vortex.""  It is the Court that defends our God-given civil rights from legislative overreach.  
Americans want its politicians to keep their political hands off the 150 years of tradition of nine Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. Americans who care about their freedoms need to speak up and stand up against this attempted coup.

Former Biden White House communications director Kate Bedingfield sparked liberal outrage for explaining Donald Trump's remarks about Christians not needing to vote anymore after 2024, arguing that he was saying that future elections didn't matter because he wouldn't be on the ballot, not calling for an end to democracy. 
""I realize this will earn me the ire of many Dems, but…I don’t think that here he’s saying there will be no more elections. I think he is saying I won’t be on the ticket either way, so who cares. Which is hideously damning in its own right, cause this is what the Republican Party has turned itself inside out and shredded its credibility for — to become a stan account for this one awful, narcissistic guy,"" Bedingfield wrote on X, reacting to a clip of Trump's speech.
Trump spoke at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida on Friday and drew liberal criticism for saying, ""Christians, get out and vote, just this time. You won’t have to do it anymore. … You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.""
Bedingfield, a CNN political commentator, was called out in several replies to her original post that argued Trump should never be given the benefit of the doubt.

Some accused her of ""minimizing"" his statements. 
Bedingfield followed up in two more posts on social media. 
""I am in no way minimizing January 6th or the threats that Trump poses to democracy when he constantly tries to undermine faith in our elections. They are real. I’m just saying that right here what he is telling us is WHY he doesn’t care about this country — cause he only cares about him,"" she said in a subsequent post. 
Appearing to respond to those suggesting she was giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, Bedingfield insisted she was not. 
""I’m neither defending him nor giving him the benefit of the doubt - I called him an awful, narcissistic man who is a threat to democracy in my tweets. But we win this thing in part by persuading people who aren’t yet persuaded. And telling them why he’s a threat - bc he only cares about himself - is more persuasive than just saying he’s a threat. This is good evidence of that,"" she said.

Here Trump helpfully reminds us that the alternative is never having the chance to vote again.""
""The only way ‘you won’t have to vote anymore’ is if Donald Trump becomes a dictator,"" Rep. Daniel Goldman, D-N.Y., said.
Conservatives such as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., suggested he was making a joke.

The Democratic ticket has seen a boost in several polls conducted since Biden withdrew his re-election bid, with surveys showing Harris performing better than the president against former President Trump.
A GOP strategist tells Fox News that the momentum might not be the result of Harris herself, but rather the Democratic Party feeling hopeful about a replacement for Biden.

Former President Trump saw his edge over President Biden expand in the wake of last month's disastrous debate performance by Biden, as calls grew louder from within his own party for the president to drop out of the race.
However, in the eight days since Biden ended his re-election bid, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly consolidated party support and became the Democrats' presumptive 2024 nominee, polls indicate it is once again a margin-of-error race.
More importantly, it is all tied up again in the battleground states that will likely decide the outcome of the presidential election.

He predicted that ""before long, Harris’ ‘honeymoon’ will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden’s partner and co-pilot. As importantly, voters will also learn about Harris’ dangerously liberal record before becoming Biden’s partner.""
""While the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’s done,"" Fabrizio emphasized.

Dozens of Russian mercenaries fighting for the notorious Wagner group in northern Africa were massacred over the weekend in Mali in an apparent ambush. 
Footage reviewed by Fox News Digital showed dozens of Russian soldiers, some in varying degrees of undress, many collapsed on top of one another, strewn around burnt vehicles and apparently dead after a violent assault.
The events leading up the attack remain unclear, though the carnage was reportedly the result of an ambush by Tuareg separatists on Wagner and Malian forces near the border with Algeria.

The ambush that appears to have occurred Saturday reportedly came after days of fighting in the Tinzaouatene area in northeast Mali.
Russian Wagner forces, formally run by Yevgeny Prigozhin who died in an August 2023 plane crash after defying the Kremlin, have been fighting alongside the Malian army since 2022 after Malian military leaders took over the North African nation and ousted French forces. 
Fighting in Mali’s northern region has escalated in recent months after Mali’s military rulers scrapped a 2015 peace deal with the separatist group in January.
Mali has reportedly claimed that the Russian forces there are not Wagner mercenaries, but rather trainers aiding the army in its fight against Islamic extremists.

However, in a rare statement, Wagner said on Telegram that its forces in Mali under commander Sergei Shevchenko – whose call sign is ""Pond"" – engaged in a fight alongside Malian forces from July 22-27.
""On the first day, the 'Pond group' destroyed most of the Islamists and put the rest to flight,"" Wagner said on Telegram according to a Reuters report Monday. ""However, (an) ensuing sandstorm allowed the radicals to regroup and increase their numbers to 1,000 people.""
Shevchenko was reportedly killed in the fighting.

A New York Magazine cover featuring Vice President Kamala Harris entitled ""Welcome to Kamalot"" was the butt of several jokes on social media on Monday.
""Welcome to Kamalot! Our new issue grapples with the two weeks that reshaped the 2024 election — and the thrill of taking a risk on Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee,"" the X post read, which also linked to the report.
""On the heels of President Joe Biden’s historic departure from his reelection campaign, our new issue captures the giddy, infectious, and potentially risky presidential campaign of Kamala Harris,"" the post continued.

Social media users ripped both the image and the message.
""The play on words is about a fictional monarch who no one under their rule also voted for,"" The Spectator's Stephen Miller said.
""It’s a funny play on words, but a magazine referring to an earlier media-driven myth creation about a previous Democratic president is a bit on the nose,"" The Washington Free Beacon's Joe Gabriel Simonson wrote.

Outlets like Not the Bee also poked fun at the cover with ""Monty Python"" references.
NY TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD URGES KAMALA HARRIS TO ‘DO BETTER' THAN BIDEN IN TAKING QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis shared the image and accused the media of trying to ""manufacture"" Harris into a candidate she's not.
""Garish and dystopian,"" Townhall.com writer Sarah Lee said. Several others called it ""weird"" and ""cringe.""
But some Harris supporters were inspired by the picture.
""Kamalot"" - we love it!"" The Democratic Coalition wrote. ""Kamala Harris has energized the Democratic Party in the space of one week like nobody has ever seen."" 
""Since we sent our last issue to the printer, Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, J.D. Vance joined his ticket, the Republicans crowed all week in Milwaukee about their impending victory, Joe Biden got COVID, his closest Democratic peers forced him out of the race, and Kamala Harris — with astonishing speed — wrapped up the race to succeed him,"" editor-in-chief David Haskell said of the new issue. 
""We made an issue that grapples with all of it, plus peeks at what could be the biggest financial-political scandal of Trump’s second term, plus sends the Look Book to the nude beach at Sandy Hook, plus a lot more (including an exceedingly long, relatively low-stakes, literary-world beach read for the ages),"" he added.

President Biden endorsed Harris for president after announcing he was dropping out of the race last Sunday following a poor debate performance and concerns about his health and stamina. Since the move, several media outlets have appeared to rally around the vice president and defend her from past controversies, including claims she was once appointed Biden's ""border czar."" 
Harris was widely dubbed the ""border czar"" after Biden tasked her in March 2021 to address the root causes of mass migration from Central and South America. While the Biden administration has rejected the title, the term was widely used by her critics and several news organizations, until now, when she seems poised to replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, former President Trump's running mate, is among the Republicans who have suggested that Harris' selection as the next nominee is undemocratic because it bypasses the voters.
""That is a threat to democracy, not the Republican Party, which is fighting for democracy every single day,"" Vance said at an Ohio campaign rally.
The Trump campaign said Monday that Trump will debate Harris should she win the Democratic Party's nomination. The Democratic National Convention runs from August 19 through August 22.

Jack Keane (Ret.) on the latest on the war in Israel after a rocket attack kills 12 children on a soccer field.
The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon posted a video warning Americans to leave the country while they can, as Israel is preparing to retaliate against Lebanon-based, Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists for a rocket attack over the weekend that killed 12 at a children’s soccer field. 
The development comes as Air France has suspended flights to and from Beirut due to the expectation a major war will unfold. German airline Lufthansa, Swiss International Air Lines and Eurowings have also suspended flights. 
""We recommend U.S. citizens develop a crisis plan of action and leave before a crisis begins,"" Rena Bitter, U.S. assistant secretary of state for the bureau of consular affairs, said in the video. ""Regularly scheduled commercial transportation is always the best option while local communications and transportation infrastructure are intact and operating normally."" 
""Should commercial air not be available, individuals already in Lebanon should be prepared to shelter in place for long periods of time,"" she warned.

Bitter also said: ""I want to assure you that Washington is laser-focused on Lebanon"" and ""the U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas."" 
She encouraged Americans in Lebanon to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive travel alerts. 
""And finally, if your relatives are planning to visit you in Lebanon this summer, please strongly encourage them to reconsider their travel given the difficulties that would hinder departure should conflict increase in the region,"" Bitter concluded.

The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, in a separate message on Sunday, urged ""U.S. citizens traveling to or from Lebanon to monitor their flight status closely, to be aware that itineraries could change with little or no warning, and to make alternate plans."" 
Early Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reportedly executed a drone strike in southern Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of two Hezbollah terrorists.  
The IDF has not commented on the strike, but it unfolded after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a three-hour cabinet meeting on Sunday, during which ministers authorized the prime minister and his minister of defense to determine the ""manner and timing"" of a military response to the lethal Hezbollah attack. 
The IDF on Monday then released video of a drone from Lebanese territory being shot down over Israel’s waters. 
Israel’s Ministry of Defense also said Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke to U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin Monday about the rocket strike on the Majdal Shams village on Saturday.

The Harris campaign is dismissing critics of their fundraising efforts that have targeted individual races and genders, arguing the strategy is nothing more than normal campaign work.
The Harris campaign has held multiple fundraisers in the week since she was elevated to the top of the ticket, holding Zoom events with titles such as ""Win with Black Men,"" ""White Dudes for Harris,"" and ""Karens for Kamala"" in hopes of attracting different demographics to the new campaign.
But the events have also earned scorn from critics on social media, with some accusing the campaign of harkening back to ""segregation.""

""The Kamala Harris campaign is bringing segregation back in style again,"" said one user on X in response to the back-to-back-to-back events.""It’s all about race with you guys,"" another critic said of the events.
The Harris campaign’s ""White Dudes for Harris"" is scheduled for Monday and may be the most widely panned, with some critics calling the event ""racist"" and ""cringy,"" while others have called the event ""condescending.""
""There’s nothing more ‘progressive’ than self-loathing White guys with low self-esteem, man buns, and a gender studies degree from SUNY Binghamton thinking if they sign up for something as condescending as this that they’ll make their first Black female friend and maybe get a date. This qualifies as ‘trying too hard’ and is so desperate as to likely backfire,"" conservative radio host Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital.
Others have poked fun at potential participants in the events, arguing that it would target men who are soft or weak.

'WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS' TO HOLD CALL AFTER 160,000 WHITE WOMEN JOIN ‘KARENS FOR KAMALA’ ZOOM
Nevertheless, the unique Zoom fundraising effort has been at least somewhat successful, with close to 100,000 Black men and women raising nearly $2 million before the ""Karen’s for Kamala"" call had over 160,000 join the call.
The Harris campaign has also dismissed the critics, noting that former President Donald Trump has engaged in similar tactics.
""I’m a bit confused. This is what campaigns do is build coalition groups. Latino Americans for Trump for example,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz told Fox News Digital.
According to a report from the New York Post, allies for Trump in Congress have been holding events tailored towards the Black community, including get-out-the-vote events titled ""Cigars, Cognac, and Congress"" that have been hosted in predominantly Black communities.

Trump has also aggressively courted Hispanic voters, with the campaign rebranding its outreach to the demographic last month by launching the ""Latino Americans for Trump"" at a rally in Las Vegas, according to a report from NBC News, ditching the former ""Latinos for Trump"" slogan for a new one that chooses to emphasize that Latinos are Americans.

U.S. intelligence officials believe that Iran is trying to sabotage former President Trump's presidential campaign through online influence operations, according to a press briefing on Monday.
Speaking to reporters, an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said U.S. spy agencies ""observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election,"" likely because Iranian leaders want to avoid increased tensions with the U.S.
The official didn't directly say that Iran was trying to undermine Trump, but that American spies ""haven’t observed a shift in Iran’s preferences"" since 2020, meaning that Iran was still targeting Trump.
During the briefing, an intelligence official also said Iran is utilizing ""vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation,"" in addition to different online campaigns.
TRUMP TELLS JESSE WATTERS THAT HE WAS NOT WARNED ABOUT GUNMAN, DESPITE REPORTS

The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied allegations of election interference to Fox News Digital.
""Iran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,"" a spokesperson said. ""A significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.""
Earlier in July, Tehran was accused of a separate plot to kill Trump after a gunman shot the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Shortly after the allegations were made, the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran said that the claims were ""unsubstantiated and malicious.""
""From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani,"" the permanent mission said to Fox News Digital at the time. ""Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice.""
Iran is not the only foreign adversary accused of meddling with the 2024 presidential election. On July 10, ODNI officials called Russia the ""preeminent threat"" to the election.

Russia is ""undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,"" an intelligence official said during the July 10 briefing, adding that Russia has grown ""more sophisticated"" in election interference. The country generally targets the Democratic Party in U.S. elections.
According to the Director of National Intelligence's latest report on Russia, the Kremlin targets the Democratic Party to diminish U.S. support for Ukraine, among other reasons.
""We assess that the Russian government and its proxies sought to denigrate the Democratic Party before the midterms and undermine confidence in the election, most likely to weaken U.S. support for Ukraine, and to erode trust in U.S. democratic institutions,"" the report reads.
Per the July 10 ODNI briefing, Russia is reportedly also using artificial intelligence to mimic American Southern and Midwestern accents on social media.
""Foreign adversaries continue to experiment with and have adopted at least some generative AI tools to more quickly and cheaply generate authentic looking content tailored primarily for social media platforms that can target specific audiences including in the U.S.,"" an ODNI official said.

FOX_28,"VP Harris may continue Biden's torch of championing gender transition surgeries, despite California AG past",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vp-harris-may-continue-bidens-torch-championing-gender-transition-surgeries-despite-california-ag-past,2024-07-30 05:21:03.046249,politics,"Protect Kids California co-founder Erin Friday joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why she considers the report 'absolutely tragic' and how the White House is responding to the accusations.
Under a Harris presidency, the push to broaden access to gender transition surgeries, as advanced by President Biden, is expected to continue, notwithstanding her earlier decision as California attorney general to reject a similar request from a prison inmate.
When Harris was the California Attorney General from 2011 to 2017, she drew backlash for denying an incarcerated inmate, Michelle Lael-Norsworthy, access to gender transition surgery. Norsworthy was sentenced to 17 years behind bars in 1987 for killing an acquaintance outside a bar. 
At the time, Harris' office contended the surgery was not necessary because the prison system was already providing adequate so-called gender-affirming care through hormone therapy and other treatments. In April 2015, however, a federal judge overruled Harris' rejection of the procedure and sided with Norsworthy, stating the surgery was medically necessary to remedy the inmate's psychological suffering.
HARRIS' SHIFT FROM TOUGH-ON-CRIME PROSECUTOR TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE FACES SCRUTINY FROM CONSERVATIVE GROUP
Harris later walked back her decision when confronted on the 2019 presidential campaign trail when she was one of the Democratic candidates, saying she takes ""full responsibility"" for what her office did. 
""I was, as you are rightly pointing out, the attorney general of California for two terms, and I had a host of clients that I was obligated to defend and represent, and I couldn’t fire my clients, and there are unfortunately situations that occurred where my clients took positions that were contrary to my beliefs,"" she said at the time during a news conference at Howard University. ""And it was an office with a lot of people who would do the work on a daily basis, and do I wish that sometimes they would have personally consulted me before they wrote the things that they wrote? Yes, I do. But the bottom line is, the buck stops with me, and I take full responsibility for what my office did.""
Meanwhile, Harris also recently hired a senior adviser with a history of sexist messages online mocking women and gay people as well as seemingly criticizing Harris on social media during her failed presidential campaign in 2019.
The Harris campaign announced earlier this week it hired Kamau M. Marshall, who has deleted thousands of old posts this week as 2024 senior adviser after he previously held positions as Joe Biden’s strategic communications director in 2020, a senior adviser for the Biden-Harris campaign and was formerly a senior adviser to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.
However, Harris' track record has otherwise remained steadfastly progressive. During her AG tenure, Harris also refused to endorse Proposition 8, which passed with more than half of the state's support, and outlawed gay marriage from the California constitution. It was later overturned in court.
And last month, under the Biden-Harris administration, health officials urged an international transgender health nonprofit to omit the age limit in its guidelines for transgender surgical procedures for adolescents — and succeeded — according to the unsealed court documents.
ABORTION, 'FREE' EDUCATION AMONG TOP ISSUES FOR HARRIS VOTERS

The documents, first reported on by The New York Times, revealed that staff for Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, pushed the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) to drop the age minimum requirement altogether to avoid seeing conservative lawmakers work to put such age restrictions into law.
After publication, the White House told Fox: ""The Administration does not support surgery for minors.""
But the White House has since expressed support for gender transition surgeries for children, according to news reports. 
""We continue to fight state and national bans on gender-affirming care, which represents a continuum of care, and respect the role of parents, families, and doctors — not politicians — in these decisions. Gender-affirming surgeries are typically reserved for adults, and we believe they should be,"" White House Domestic Policy Council director Neera Tanden told The 19th, a gender and politics advocacy nonprofit newsroom. 
After President Biden abruptly suspended his re-election campaign last week and endorsed VP Harris, LGBTQ and transgender advocacy groups rushed to endorse her, too. 
""Advocates for Trans Equality (A4TE) is proud to announce our endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency,"" the organization said in a statement. ""Since taking office as our nation’s first woman of color Vice President, Harris has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to advancing the well-being of the transgender community.

President Biden on Monday outlined his wish for Congress to impose ""bold"" rules on the Supreme Court, including term limits and a new code of conduct, and to draft a new constitutional amendment that limits presidential immunity. 
""In recent years, extreme opinions that the Supreme Court has handed down have undermined the longest civil rights principles and protections,"" Biden claimed Monday at the LBJ Presidential Library at an event in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.
Biden named a number of recent cases, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade and Trump v. United States, which he said ""most shockingly"" established some presidential immunity and called it a ""dangerous precedent.""
""This court is being used to weaponize an extreme and unchecked agenda,"" Biden said and called the immunity decision ""a total affront to the basic expectations we have for those who wield the power of this,"" the president said.
BIDEN, HARRIS CALL FOR SUPREME COURT TERM LIMITS, CODE OF CONDUCT, LIMITS ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY

""My fellow Americans, based on all my experience, I'm certain we need these reforms. We need these reforms to restore trust in the courts, preserve the system of checks and balances that are vital to our democracy,"" he said.
Biden's reforms would eliminate any immunity a former president enjoys for crimes committed while in office. Regarding the Supreme Court, Biden wants to impose a term limit of 18 years for justices. Once fully adopted, it would allow presidents to appoint new justices at a cadence of once every two years.
Biden argued the new Supreme Court code of conduct should require justices to ""disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that such radical changes would be ""dead on arrival"" in the House, and it's unclear if Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. would push them in the Senate. 
Biden on Monday retorted that Johnson's ""thinking"" is ""dead on arrival."" 
The changes mark a shift in Biden's approach to the Supreme Court. He has long resisted calls from within his own party to make changes like expanding the number of justices on the court, calling that a ""bonehead"" idea that would undermine the court's credibility. 
But now, as the high court sits with a Republican-nominee majority, Biden is pivoting to a much more radical approach. 
Vice President Harris, who is also running for president, earlier on Monday endorsed the push. ""Today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent,"" she said.

Amid the gleaming classic cars and towering combines on display at Maryland’s Carroll County 4-H Fair, I found a bevy of voters to talk to. I was curious if they thought that President Joe Biden is still running the country. Nobody said yes. Not one soul.When I asked Marge, a local in her 60s who works for a remodeling company, she just laughed at first and said, ""No, not at all."" She was handing out American flags at her booth and I pushed a bit, asking when she thought he had stopped being in charge, ""About a year,"" she said, ""but it's gotten worse and worse,"" referring to Biden’s decline.Mark and Bob, on the other hand, two farmers manning the American Legion table, don’t believe Biden has ever been in control, though they admit it is far more obvious now. So, who do they think is running things? ""I don’t know, ""Mark said, ""maybe Obama, or some cabal, it's never been Joe."" 
DEMS LIKELY NEED A POLITICAL MIRACLE TO PASS BIDEN'S LONGSHOT HIGH COURT OVERHAUL
""This is Obama’s third term,"" Bob chimed in without quite interrupting, as old friends do, ""and if Kamala wins it will be his fourth term.""Mark told me that he had not always been a firm Trump supporter, and when I asked what had changed he told me, ""When Trump spoke at the March for Life [in 2020] it meant a lot to me, no president ever had, we go almost every year.""It was telling that what sold him on Trump was a personal choice by the former president, and a risky one, not a cookie-cutter focus grouped decision, but one that Mark believed was from Trump’s heart.

They explained to me that Carroll is the reddest county in the Old Line State, and it felt that way. There were Trump shirts here and there, flags everywhere, not a whole lot of vegan options at the food stalls, no kale was present unless on display, it certainly didn’t feel like I was in a blue state.
HARRIS' MOMENTUM A REFLECTION OF DEMOCRAT 'RELIEF' REPLACING BIDEN: GOP STRATEGIST
Congressional candidate Kim Klacik is looking to take advantage of that by vying, as a Republican, for the open seat being left by Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger, and owing to redistricting in 2022, the website 538 has moved the district from strong blue to lean blue.
""This is Obama’s third term,"" Bob chimed in without quite interrupting, as old friends do. ""And if Kamala wins it will be his fourth term.""
It’s still a bit of a long shot, but as Klacik campaigned alongside Board of Education candidate Dr. Greg Malveaux it was clear she has a following in the area. ""I hear you on the radio,"" one middle-aged man came up and said to her, ""You make a lot of sense.""
All politics is local, so the conversations included education -- I spotted a Moms for Liberty tent nearby, they are becoming ubiquitous -- as well as a controversial plan by Democrats to run power lines with giant towers through people’s farms, supposedly to save the environment.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Time and again the folks I talked to came back to the national political scene. They have not moved on from the assassination attempt against Trump as much of the media seem to have, and at least one person I spoke to is suspicious about the role of the Secret Service and the FBI.
What was notable about the consensus that Biden had been put out to pasture, much like the prize Heifers in the livestock displays, is that there was no real sense of shock or fear or anger, more of a resigned attitude that we are simply governed by committee now.Nobody I spoke to particularly liked Vice President Kamala Harris, but they also didn’t seem to hate her, it was more like she was irrelevant, just a figurehead who could almost be anyone.I got the strong sense, not for the first time since Biden bowed out, that in some voters’ minds this has become a choice not between Trump and Harris but between Trump and the deep state.

CNN_1,Attorney for Mexican drug lord says client ‘forcibly kidnapped’ by El Chapo’s son,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/us/el-chapo-son-guzman-kidnapping-allegation/index.html,2024-07-29 08:56:00,us,"
            The attorney for Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the alleged co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, says his client “neither surrendered nor negotiated any terms with the US government,” but was instead kidnapped.
    

            Zambada’s attorney forcefully denied any suggestion previously raised by Mexican officials that his client may have surrendered of his own volition or willingly come to the United States as part of a deal.
    

            In a phone conversation and a statement sent to CNN Sunday, Frank Pérez said that Zambada, 76, was kidnapped by Joaquín Guzmán López, one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the other co-founder of the Sinaloa cartel, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in US federal prison.

            “Joaquín Guzmán López forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied, and a black bag was placed over his head,” Pérez said in the statement.
    

            “He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane, his legs tied to the seat by Joaquin, and brought to the US against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquín and my client,” Pérez added.
    

            US law enforcement officials had previously told CNN that Joaquín Guzmán López had duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest by making him believe they were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate. Instead, the officials said, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, Texas, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac.
    

            Zambada has been one of the most elusive figures in the criminal world.  He was able to lead the Sinaloa cartel for decades and, up until now, hadn’t seen a jail cell.  Mike Vigil, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who served with the agency for 31 years, described the alleged Mexican drug lord as “astute.”
    

            “Mayo Zambada, prior to Thursday and over 50 years of involvement in the drug trade had never been captured, never served any time, so he is highly respected by even his rivals,” Vigil said.
    

            Mexican Security Secretary Rosa Icela Rodríguez said Friday her government was not part of any operation to detain the alleged Mexican drug lords but clarified that the Mexican government is going to “keep collaborating with the United States government as we have done up until now.”

US operation to capture Sinaloa cartel leaders had the help of one of the captured men: a son of ‘El Chapo,’ official says


            “You ask if (they) surrendered or were captured. That is part of the investigation and part of the information that we will be waiting for from the United States government,” Rodríguez told Mexican media, with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador by her side.
    

            President López Obrador said, regardless of whether Zambada and Guzmán López turned themselves in or were captured, the fact they’re now in custody is an important step forward in the fight against drug trafficking.
    

            “I believe that it is a sign that there we are working together (Mexico and the United States), even though in this specific case neither the Mexican Army nor the Navy participated, but the fact that he (Zambada) made the decision to surrender or leave, run the risk of going to the United States and getting captured there, means an important advance in the fight against drug trafficking,” the Mexican president said.
    

            CNN learned Saturday that whatever action the US might have taken to arrest Zambada and Guzmán López prompted a furious behind-the-scenes reaction from Mexican government officials who are demanding senior US law enforcement officials explain exactly what transpired, according to a US official familiar with the operation.
    

            The Mexican government is “totally pissed,” the source said, noting officials in Mexico were not briefed ahead of time on the planned captures.
    

            US officials were hesitant to brief Mexican counterparts in advance due to fears the operation could have been compromised, a law enforcement source told CNN. The source noted details of the sensitive operation were also highly restricted within the US government until Zambada and Guzmán López were taken into custody.
    

            The Mexican government has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the diplomatic row between both countries following the arrests.
    

            CNN has also reached out to Mexican officials for comment regarding Zambada’s attorney’s kidnapping claim.
    

            CNN also reached out to Guzmán López’s attorney regarding the claim Sunday but did not receive a response.
    

            Zambada entered a not guilty plea to all charges in US District Court in El Paso on Friday and is scheduled to appear in-person in that same court for a status conference August 1 at 11 a.m. local time, according to Perez and filed court documents.
    

            The arrests of Zambada and Guzmán López mark a major development in decades-long efforts to capture and prosecute alleged cartel bosses. And the details revealed so far about what led to their arrests give a glimpse into the inner workings of what authorities describe as one of the world’s most notorious and nefarious criminal enterprises.

CNN_2,The Israel-Hezbollah war that no one wants could finally blow up,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-war-blow-up-analysis-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 08:53:00,world,"
            Back in May, Amos Hochstein, US President Joe Biden’s point-man for keeping a lid on tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, spoke in a webinar.
    

            “What I worry about every single day,” he said, “is that a miscalculation or an accident… hits a bus full of children, or hits another kind of civilian target, that could force the political system in either country to retaliate in a way that slides us into war. Even though both sides probably understand that a fuller or deeper-scale war is in neither side’s interest.”
    

            The equivalent of that bus came on Saturday evening in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
    

            A rocket, which Israel says was launched by Hezbollah from Shebaa in southern Lebanon, slammed into a soccer pitch in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. Twelve children, ranging in age from 10 to 16, were killed while taking part in a training session. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike. Will Hochstein’s fear of a fuller-scale war now also come to pass?
    

            If Israel’s Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, is to be believed, it probably will. “We are approaching the moment of an all-out war against Hezbollah,” he said in an Israeli television interview on Saturday evening. “The response to this event will be accordingly.”
    

            The United States has apparently blessed retaliatory action, to some degree. “We stand by Israel’s right to defend its citizens from terrorist attacks,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, before adding that the US did not want to “see the conflict escalate.”
    

            The response, so far, has been relatively timid. More strikes will probably follow. “We’re fed up with lofty rhetoric and hollow words accompanied by feeble action,” former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN. “The only way to stop all of this, the only way to deter our enemies from hitting us… is to fight back and to hit them. There’s no other way.”

Israel says Hezbollah will ‘pay the price’ after blaming it for attack on soccer field that killed 12 children


            For months now, the international community has been trying to de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. With Iran’s strongest proxy estimated to have at least 150,000 missiles and rockets pointing south, the fear is of a war that would devastate Lebanon, and do serious damage to Israel.
    

            Moreover, as Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN, “it has the potential to create a situation that we have never seen in this region: a major regional war, which could draw in the Gulf”. He warns it could also lead to direct confrontation between the United States and Iran.
    

            And yet, over the past near-10 months of fighting, Israel, Hezbollah and Iran have always pulled back from what appeared to be the brink. In January, Israel took out a senior Hamas leader in Beirut. All-out war failed to materialise. In April, Israel killed a top commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRCHG) in Damascus. In response, Iran launched unprecedented strikes on Israel. All-out war failed to materialise.
    

            The status quo, of course, can’t continue either. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from their homes. Large swathes of northern Israel are like ghost towns. A similar picture plays out in southern Lebanon. The best way to avoid all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, says Blinken, is to get a ceasefire in Gaza. Talks aimed at achieving that resume on Sunday.
    

            But that would only be a short-term fix. Israel wants to remove the Hezbollah threat entirely, moving it back to the Litani River, in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution that ended the last major war between the two in 2006. “If the world doesn’t get Hezbollah away from the border, Israel will do it,” said Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in December.
    

            And so despite the bombast, domestic pressures, the fears and the escalations, the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah continues to simmer rather than boil over. No one seems to want this war. But as Hochstein warned in that same webinar: “Wars have started historically around the world even when leaders didn’t want them, because they had no choice.”

CNN_3,Venezuelans vote in crucial presidential election as opposition signal high voter turnout,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-29 09:53:00,world,"
            Venezuelans voted Sunday in a highly consequential presidential election in which the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, faces one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            Long lines began to form outside polling centers in the capital, Caracas, before they were due to open at 6 a.m. ET and continued through the day. Polls officially closed at 6 p.m but will remain open for those waiting to vote, though it remains unclear when the electoral authorities will announce the results.
    

            Some voters in Caracas appeared optimistic for change. “[After] 25 years, I see that there is a real chance to change. I see a lot of people getting together to vote,” voter Mariana Schemel said.
    

            Others spoke about wanting to help their country, which has seen an exodus of Venezuelans fleeing economic collapse. “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.

            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation, and others will feel compelled to leave if Maduro wins, says the opposition coalition that has promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy.
    

            Fleeing Venezuelans “would create huge pressure and destabilization in the region. And of course, in the south border of the United States, but in the country,” opposition leader Machado said Sunday.
    

            “A peaceful transition to democracy would mean that not only the flow will stop, but that millions of Venezuelans will come back home,” she added.
    

            There has been mounting concern that the opposition will not see a fair contest as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied. Experts note, however, that concerns of vote tampering may be mitigated by the planned presence of opposition party representatives at each polling station.
    

            The opposition coalition reported what they said were minor irregularities on Sunday, but voting proceedings appeared to be smooth in most of the country.
    

            People came out in droves to vote on Sunday, according to the opposition coalition. Outside a polling station in Caracas, Venezuelans chanted “we want to vote” as they waited for hours in line to get to the ballot box. Abroad, Venezuelan expatriates rallied in Miami, Florida, and the Peruvian capital Lima.
    

            More than 21 million people are registered to vote, both in the country and abroad. The opposition coalition reported later on Sunday afternoon a 54.8% voter turnout, representing at least 11.7 million voters.
    

            “This is huge. If this continues, it will be a historic participation figure,” Machado said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. “What you are seeing is the most important civic act in our history.”

            Machado’s statement also spoke of reported “problems” at some voting stations. “In our monitoring there were 1,300 stations in which there were problems for our observers to enter. At this time there are only 13 tables with problems.”
    

            Machado said 18 voting stations out 30,000 nationwide “couldn’t be set up.” The opposition leader also reported a “slowdown in the process and scanning of ID cards that is not justified in any way. We hope this will be eliminated and speed up the process.” However, Machado says these have been “exceptions to a process that develops peacefully.”
    

            Electoral authorities say only an identity card is needed to be eligible to vote, and a Sunday statement from the election body, the National Electoral Council (CNE), said that there is no dress code for polling centers.
    

            But in Caracas, a 55-year-old voter told CNN he was turned away from a polling center by soldiers for wearing cargo shorts. After queuing for several hours, Henrique Mendoza said the military patrolling around the center would not let him in due to his outfit.
    

            When Maduro voted at 6 a.m. in the capital, he urged citizens to respect the results of the election. His main challenger González said the opposition coalition is “going to wait for the results from the National Electoral Council, however, we also have our methods and mechanisms to know the progress of today’s electoral process.”

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements. Only 69,211 Venezuelans living abroad are eligible to vote in this year’s poll, according to data published by the CNE.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            The Biden administration has been monitoring the elections, telling reporters on Friday that the US stands prepared to levy additional sanctions against Venezuela if the democratic process is not allowed to unfold.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris said “the will of the Venezuelan people must be respected” in a post on X, adding that “despite the many challenges, we will continue to work toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future for the people of Venezuela.”
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.

CNN_4,US to revamp military forces in Japan in ‘historic’ move as regional tensions mount,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/asia/us-austin-trilateral-japan-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 10:46:00,world,"
            The United States will overhaul its military forces in Japan as the two countries move to deepen defense cooperation, Washington and Tokyo said Sunday, in a sweeping step to modernize their alliance in the face of mounting security threats in Asia.
    

            The announcement comes as Japan and the US warily eye a region where China is seen as increasingly aggressive in asserting its disputed territorial claims and North Korea continues its illegal weapons program – while both tighten ties with Russia as it wages war in Ukraine.
    

            US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their Japanese counterparts Minoru Kihara and Yoko Kamikawa announced the plan in a joint statement following a meeting in Tokyo, where they also called China’s “political, economic, and military coercion” the “greatest strategic challenge” in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
    

            The move is likely to stoke the ire of Beijing, which has watched warily as the US has bolstered ties with regional allies in a part of the world where observers say China seeks to be the dominant power – and where it’s accused the US of fostering a Cold War-style bloc mentality.
    

            Under the new plan, US forces in Japan would be “reconstituted” as a joint force headquarters reporting to the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command to “facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies,” according to the statement.
    

            In a press conference following the meeting, Austin hailed the countries’ move to “modernize” their alliance command and control as an “historic decision.”
    

            “This will be the most significant change to US Forces Japan since its creation, and one of the strongest improvements in our military ties with Japan in 70 years,” Austin said.
    

            He pointed both to the “upgrade” of US Forces Japan with “expanded missions and operational responsibilities,” announced Sunday, and Japan’s new Joint Operations Command, saying that the countries were reinforcing their “combined ability to deter and respond to coercive behavior in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.”
    

            The announcement follows an April summit in Washington between US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, where the two vowed to upgrade their respective command-and-control framework “to strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges.”
    

            Details of the implementation would be figured out in working groups led by US Indo-Pacific Command, a senior US defense official said ahead of Sunday’s announcement, adding that there is no intention to integrate Japanese forces into the US commands.

Japan’s Kishida warns world at ‘historic turning point’ as he touts US alliance ahead of Biden summit


            US Forces Japan (USFJ), whose headquarters is Yokota Air Base, consists of approximately 54,000 military personnel stationed in Japan under a 1960 mutual cooperation and security treaty.
    

            The expected reconfiguration comes as Japan shifts its defense posture, veering away from the pacifist constitution imposed on it by the United States in the aftermath of World War II, with a plan to boost defense spending to about 2% of its GDP by 2027 and acquire counterstrike capabilities.
    

            These changes have cemented Japan’s centrality to Washington’s regional security strategy and its push for increasing coordination with allies and partners amid rising regional tensions – and as it increasingly sees security in Europe and Asia as intertwined in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
    

            The latest move also comes months ahead of the US presidential election, which American allies around the world have been watching closely, as Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the cost of US alliances.
    

            When asked whether the elections could impact US-Japan relations, Blinken said the long-standing alliance “was stronger than it’s even been” and would be “sustained irrespective of the outcome of elections in either of our countries.”
    

            “The reason for that is because it’s manifestly in the interests of our people, the Japanese people, the American people, and people well beyond our countries,” he said.
    

            China was repeatedly mentioned with pointed language in the joint statement, with the ministers outlining shared concerns including what they described as Beijing’s “intensifying attempts to unilaterally change the status quo” in the East China Sea, its “threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea,” and its “support for Russia’s defense industrial base.”
    

            China has been aggressively asserting its claims in the contested waters of the South China Sea and maintaining an extended presence near Japanese-controlled islands Beijing claims in the East China Sea. Western leaders have accused Beijing of “enabling” Moscow’s war in Ukraine through the provision of dual-use goods, a charge Beijing denies.
    

            The ministers also said Taiwan’s “political transition period should not be used as a pretext for provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait,” a statement that follows Chinese military drills encircling the self-ruled democracy Beijing claims just days after Taiwan swore in a new president in May.
    

            When asked during the press conference about the relationship between the new command and concerns about China, Austin said the decision to strengthen the command was “not based upon any threat from China.” “It’s based on our desire and our ability to work closer together and to be more effective,” the defense chief said.
    

            In the statement, the ministers also condemned North Korea’s missile testing and nuclear weapons programs, and condemned deepening Russia-North Korea cooperation, including Russia’s “procurement of ballistic missiles and other materiel from North Korea” for use in Ukraine.
    

            The meeting follows a trilateral meeting earlier Sunday between defense chiefs from the United States, Japan and South Korea, the first of its kind in Tokyo – and yet another sign of the tightening coordination of regional US allies.
    

            That came nearly one year after a landmark summit between the three countries held by Biden at Camp David. The burgeoning trilateral coordination between the US, Japan and South Korea marks a shift in regional relations, with Seoul and Tokyo – both long-standing US allies – widely seen as working to put aside historic animosity and mistrust to better address shared security threats.
    

            On Sunday, the three defense chiefs vowed to strengthen cooperation to deter “nuclear and missile threats” from North Korea and formalized a trilateral agreement that reaffirms the “unwavering nature of the new era of trilateral cooperation,” according to a joint statement.
    

            This would “institutionalize” trilateral security cooperation among their countries’ defense authorities, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.

CNN_5,Israel says Hezbollah will ‘pay the price’ after blaming it for attack on soccer field that killed 12 children,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 10:19:00,world,"
            Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children, touching off fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.
    

            Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks.
    

            Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to a statement from the military on Sunday morning. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes.
    

            And on a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.
    

            “Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.”
    

            The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in a barrage Israel’s military quickly blamed on the Iran-backed militant group.
    

            It killed 12 children and left 44 people injured, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.
    

            The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday backed Israel’s assessment, saying “every indication” suggested the strike was a rocket fired by Hezbollah.
    

            Some 20,000 Druze Arabs live in the Golan Heights, an area Israel seized from Syria in 1967 during the Six-Day War and annexed in 1981. Considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, the area is also home to about 25,000 Israeli Jewish settlers.
    

            Most Druze there identify as Syrian and have rejected offers of Israeli citizenship. The Regional Council of Majdal Shams said Sunday that none of the 12 children killed had Israeli citizenship.
    

            Hundreds of mourners lined streets on Sunday for a funeral procession honouring the victims of the strike. People dressed in black sang as white coffins were carried to a funeral home, with others carrying flower wreaths.
    

            Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid spoke at the funeral, saying “the children who died on that football field could have been any of our children. Therefore, they are indeed the children of each of us. These are our children.”
    

            But a number of residents berated far-right Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich at the event, crowding the finance minister and demanding he leave. Smotrich was eventually ushered away by security.
    

            Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.
    

            While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.
    

            “We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” a statement read.
    

            Analysing footage of the explosion and the aftermath, experts told CNN the blast and damage were consistent with the types of munitions fired at northern Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria.
    

            Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told CNN Sunday that weapon fragments at the scene indicated the rocket was fired by Hezbollah or another militant group. Ball said that based on the available evidence, he ruled out the possibility of the blast having been caused by an Israeli interceptor missile, such as those fired by the Iron Dome air defense system.
    

            A Western official familiar with the intelligence told CNN there was no doubt the strike was done by Hezbollah, but it was not believed to be intentional. The expectation is that Israel will respond but has no desire to escalate to a broader conflict, the official said, adding that Hezbollah knows the response is coming and will hopefully be rational in its own response.

The Israel-Hezbollah war that no one wants could finally blow up


            Hezbollah’s head of media relations unit, Mohammad Afif, told CNN on Sunday the militant group was in a “state of mobilization,” and had vacated some military posts after the escalation in threats from Israel. He did not provide further details on the location or the number of the positions involved.
    

            “The state of mobilization and preparedness, and the vacating some of the military positions here and there is a normal part of the war, especially since the escalation in Israeli threats since yesterday,” he said. Afif described the confrontations between Israel and Hezbollah which began on October 8 as a “state of war.”
    

            Israel’s initial overnight response appeared to stop short of the kind of attack that would launch an all-out war, but it gave rise to an incredibly tense day in the region.
    

            Iran on Sunday warned Israel against “any new adventures” aimed at Lebanon, in a statement issued by foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani. The statement said Israel “does not have the minimum moral authority to comment and judge about the incident that happened in Majdal Shams area, and the claims of this regime against others will not be heard either.”
    

            Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short by several hours his visit to the United States and returned to Israel to convene a meeting of the security cabinet in Tel Aviv to discuss the situation. His office said following the meeting that the cabinet had “authorized the prime minister and the minister of defense to decide on the nature of the response against the terror organization Hezbollah, and on its’ timing.”
    

            The prime minister said earlier that he was “shocked” by the attack. “I can say that the State of Israel will not be silent about this. We will not put this off the agenda,” he said.
    

            The Lebanese foreign minister warned that if Israel responded by invading Lebanon it risked dragging the whole region into war.
    

            “[A] war against Lebanon is a regional war,” caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told CNN’s Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman Sunday in Beirut. “It’s not going to be Hezbollah against Israel…You have the Houthis, you have the Iraqi militias, you have militias in Syria who are not Syrians: Pakistani, Afghan militias. They’re all going to get involved in that.”
    

            He said in the case of a war, Lebanon would not get involved but would stand behind Hezbollah.
    

            “If there is a war, we’re supporting Hezbollah, definitely,” Bou Habib said. “Not because of conviction but because of any attack on our country, we support Hezbollah in this regard.”
    

            A war between Lebanon and Israel in 2006 devastated much of Lebanon, yet Hezbollah foiled Israel’s ultimate plan to dismantle the group. Throughout the 34-day war, Hezbollah is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets – a daily average of 117.
    

            Bou Habib stressed that another war would not only be detrimental to Lebanon, but to Israel as well.
    

            “[Israel] will return to the stone ages as well, it’s not by the Lebanese government,” he said, referring to comments by Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant back in June 2023, in which he said the Israeli military could send Lebanon “back to the Stone Age.”
    

            However, Bou Habib told the Lebanese Al Jadeed News TV channel that Lebanon had received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response would be “limited.” He added that Hezbollah would in turn limit its actions. Pressed by the anchor to identify the countries that had offered this reassurance, he hinted that the “US and France are very concerned about the issue.”
    

            Lebanon has called for an international investigation into the attack to determine who was responsible.

            Egypt’s foreign minister on Sunday warned “of the dangers of opening a new war front in Lebanon.” It called on “influential forces in the international community to intervene immediately” to prevent a drawn-out conflict.
    

            The spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said he called on “all parties to exercise maximum restraint and reiterates once again his consistent call on all concerned to avoid any further escalation,” according to the spokesperson.
    

            Meanwhile, the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport announced several cancelations of flights to the Lebanese capital on its website early Monday local time. The canceled flights were scheduled to depart the cities of Athens, Stockholm, Dusseldorf, Addis Ababa, Ankara, Antalya, and Adana on Monday.
    

            Earlier Sunday, Lebanon’s Middle East Airlines (MEA) announced it had delayed six of its return flights to Beirut until Monday.
    

            The flights will be departing London, Copenhagen, Doha, Dammam, Dubai and Jeddah Monday morning, MEA said in a statement that did not specify a reason for the delays.
    

            In the wake of the strike, some residents of Majdal Shams have questioned whether the area’s early warning system was working properly.
    

            An eyewitness to the strike on the soccer field told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond that the rocket hit less than five seconds after the sirens sounded.
    

            Majdal Shams resident Taymor Wili said he was in his apartment overlooking the soccer field when the rocket hit. He said there was no time for the children on the field to react between the first alert siren and the moment of impact.
    

            He also said the safety shelter was only yards from the soccer field and if those on the field had had more time, they likely could have made it to the shelter. Video of the safety shelter shows it yards away from the crater made by the rocket’s impact.
    

            In addition to the eyewitness testimony, in several videos from Majdal Shams, sirens can  be heard for several seconds before the rocket hits.
    

            In a response to a question from CNN, the IDF said a preliminary examination showed the alert system was working properly before the rocket hit. “The time for sheltering in this area is immediate,” the IDF said.
    

            It added that the IDF “makes all feasible efforts to provide the public with the required warning time as part of the effort to save lives.”
    

            The IDF said it sends “condolences to the families and will continue to work in order to make life-saving alerts accessible.”

CNN_6,Why Thailand is making it easier for travelers to stay longer,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/travel/destination-thailand-visa-digital-nomads-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 10:05:00,world,"
            Maybe you want to escape the winter months at home, opting instead to take care of your business on a laptop from the comfort of your rented Phuket villa as you gaze over the Andaman Sea. Or perhaps you’re ready to step into the ring and embark on a new career as a Muay Thai fighter.
    

            Either way, Thailand has you covered.
    

            The popular Southeast Asia destination recently introduced a new five-year visa targeted at remote workers and other travelers looking to stay in the kingdom for extended periods.
    

            According to a statement issued by the Thai prime minister’s office, the Destination Thailand Visa (DTV) will allow eligible travelers a period of stay up to 180 days per visit, on a multiple-entry basis, within five years. (This means they will need to leave the country when their 180 days are up, and the time resets when they re-enter.)

            The government statement says the visa is open to several categories of remote workers, including digital nomads and freelancers. It’s also aimed at those looking to visit to engage in activities such as Muay Thai training or Thai cooking classes, or come for extended medical treatments.
    

            To apply, travelers need to show evidence that they have a minimum of 500,000 baht (about $13,800) in funds, as well as documents to support the purpose of their visit, such as a letter from a medical center or proof of employment status outside of Thailand.
    

            The visa, which costs 10,000 baht, does not permit applicants to seek employment in Thailand.
    

            The Thai government has also expanded the list of countries and territories allowed visa-free access for tourism and short-term business from 57 to 93, while also extending the length of stay from 30 days to 60.
    

            Meanwhile, the number of countries/territories whose nationals are entitled to a Visa on Arrival has also been bumped up from 19 to 31.
    

            According to government figures, Thailand welcomed 17.5 million foreign tourists in the first half of this year, a 35% increase over the same period last year.
    

            But experts say the new visa measures aren’t simply aimed at attracting more visitors.
    

            “If you look at what Thailand has done, the initiatives and campaigns it’s put in place over the last two years to drive up visitor arrivals, it’s been pretty successful,” says Gary Bowerman, founder of Check-in Asia, a tourism-focused research and marketing company.
    

            “So it leads Southeast Asia by a long way in terms of visitor arrivals. But the problem – and this is a big problem – is that although it’s got the numbers coming in, the average spend per visitor is relatively low.”
    

            Bowerman adds that the pressure on resources is getting tougher, too.

South Korea’s digital nomad visa is about much more than travel


            “The incremental value of just having more and more people isn’t being felt, so they need to find ways to actually increase the length of stay, increase the per-person spend,” he says, noting that the bulk of Thailand’s international arrivals are regional travelers who visit for short periods.
    

            “You’ve got a lot of people coming in, moving around, getting out quite quickly. That puts intensifying strain on the infrastructure, on the airports, on the transport networks … They need to slow the pace.”
    

            That, he says, is why they’re trying to attract long-stay visitors like digital nomads, too — “simply because it puts less pressure on the entry points and the transport points.”
    

            According to the PM office’s statement, the new measures are aimed at promoting tourism and boosting the economy and have been in effect since July 15.
    

            Thailand certainly isn’t alone in its desire to bring travelers in for longer periods. Olivier Ponti, director of intelligence and marketing at ForwardKeys, a travel data company, says more people than ever are seeking out opportunities for extended holidays – and countries are paying attention.

            “A global trend we have observed throughout the post-Covid-19 period has been that travelers are staying at destinations for longer,” he says. “Arrivals to the Asia Pacific region remain -23% vs 2019, yet longer stays (two weeks or more) are just -8% below pre-pandemic levels.”
    

            Many destinations have already launched new visas to accommodate this increase in remote working, he says, with flexible workplace policies now allowing people to combine work and leisure more easily.
    

            “Particularly, visas which allow for multiple entry, have longer validity periods, and those which allow for family members to accompany the visa holder on the trip are having success in attracting long-stay tourists,” says Ponti.
    

            Other factors come into play in terms of desirability too, he says, such as a destination’s quality of life, cost of living, national and local sustainability practices, and tax benefits, to name a few.
    

            As for Thailand, Ponti says the new long-stay visa is most likely to be embraced by long-haul travelers “who tend to stay much longer on average compared to regional travelers within the Asia Pacific.”
    

            “Currently, the proportion of tickets with long stays (over 14 nights) remains around 25%, medium stays (6-13 nights) represent 45%,” says Ponti, referring to numbers based on flight booking data.
    

            “These measures will likely enhance the appeal of Thailand for long-term visitors, potentially increasing these proportions over time.”

CNN_7,New York Times: Text messages from law enforcement show concerns were raised more than 90 minutes before Trump rally shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-police-shooter-presence/index.html,2024-07-29 11:22:00,politics,"
            Text messages between law enforcement before the assassination attempt against Donald Trump earlier this month suggest that some officers raised the shooter’s presence at the rally more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof and fired eight rounds at the former president.
    

            In text messages obtained by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and reported by The New York Times on Sunday, a local countersniper first raised with his colleagues that he saw someone park near their vehicles and sit on a nearby picnic table at 4:26 p.m.
    

            According to the messages, local law enforcement later took a picture of the same man, who turned out to be the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, and sent it to other officers in a group chat nearly 30 minutes before Crooks would shoot at Trump at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.

            “Kid learning around building we are in,” one texts reads, according to The Times. “I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS [Secret Service] snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Grassley’s office.
    

            Questions remain over how local law enforcement failed, after spotting Crooks previously, to stop the shooter from climbing up the side of a nearby building and coming so close to killing a former president and current Republican nominee. It’s also unclear how the Secret Service designated security that day and who managed the communication between local and federal law enforcement.
    

            Members of the Beaver County SWAT team, which assisted in security, said in an interview with ABC News that they were supposed to have a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service when the agents arrived in Butler but that no such meeting took place.
    

            “We were supposed to get a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service members whenever they arrived, and that never happened,” Jason Woods, a sniper on the team, told ABC News.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment.
    

            It’s also unclear, based on congressional testimony and reporting, what time local law enforcement told the Secret Service directly about Crooks and sent the pictures one of their members took of the soon-to-be shooter before he accessed the roof.
    

            In the wake of the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, acting Director Ronald Rowe, along with FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, will testify before two Senate committees Tuesday about the assassination attempt, as lawmakers hope to get more answers around the failures that day.

            As the Park Fire continues to rapidly grow and threaten thousands more acres of northern California, an evacuation warning has been issued for the town of Paradise, a place where people know the horrors of a raging wildfire all too well.
    

            In 2018, the deadliest wildfire in state history, the Camp Fire, incinerated much of the town. Three years later, the Dixie Fire burned nearby. And now, residents of Paradise say the smell of smoke is already enough to traumatize them anew.

            Paradise Mayor Ron Lassonde was visibly emotional as he told CNN affiliate KCRA it was “hard to talk about” the Park Fire as it brought back memories of 2018.
    

            “Every once in a while, we smell smoke or see smoke like that, it does trigger us. It triggers the people here in Paradise. When you go through trauma, that’s what happens,” Lassonde told KCRA.
    

            Ava Elsner, who lived through the fire six years ago, told CNN she fears for her neighbors as the Park Fire – now the seventh-largest wildfire in California history – burns nearby.
    

            “I don’t want anyone else to experience this. It’s the most traumatizing, terrifying, and saddening thing to have a whole community go up in flames, and to lose all your personal items … so to see my parents go through this is just really hard,” Elsner told CNN. “I want to stay strong for them and comfort them the way that they did for me. And it’s just, it’s just difficult.”
    

            Meanwhile, wildfires are burning across the mountain west, in the US and north of the border in Canada, as firefighters deal with strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures to try to get the blazes under control.
    

            There were 103 large wildfires burning across the US as of Sunday morning, including 36 in Oregon and 15 in California, according to the Interagency Fire Center, and hundreds in Canada reported by its Fire Center. Here’s a brief rundown of some of the largest fires:

            • Park Fire – Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties, California: The Park Fire has become California’s largest wildfire this year, covering more than 360,000 acres, or 562 square miles – larger than the city of Phoenix – and it’s still spreading. The fire was 12% contained as of Sunday afternoon, according to CalFire. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official. The fire began Wednesday in the Chico area, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. CalFire said Saturday a preliminary air assessment showed over 100 structures impacted by the fire, and officials on the ground confirmed 20 structures have been destroyed.
    

            • Durkee Fire – Baker and Malheur counties in Oregon: The largest active wildfire in Oregon is the Durkee Fire, which has burned more than 288,000 acres. It started July 17 near the Oregon-Idaho state line. Amid high temperatures, extremely dry vegetation and strong winds, the fire was 49% contained as of Sunday evening, according to Oregon Wildfire Response and Recovery.
    

            • Jasper National Park Fire – Jasper, Alberta: Large sections of the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies are being consumed by “a wall of flames.” As of Sunday afternoon, the fire was at just under 80,000 acres, according to park officials, making it the largest wildfire in more than 100 years in Jasper National Park. Thousands of visitors and residents fled as flames devastated nearly 40% of the town’s structures. There are currently 135 wildfires burning in the forest protection area of the province, 34 of which are out of control, authorities said Sunday afternoon. The fire is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather ahead, Parks Canada said.
    

            A firefighting pilot was found dead in a single-engine air tanker on Friday after going missing the night before while working in the vicinity of the 221-square-mile Falls Fire burning in the Malheur National Forest, among several large wildfires burning across Oregon, according to officials.
    

            Meanwhile, the lightning-sparked Durkee Fire is the largest of the wildfires currently burning across Oregon, which has been the hardest hit by fires in recent days.
    

            Three people were injured and four homes and 19 other structures were destroyed as the fire spread, according to the Oregon Department of Emergency Management.
    

            Evacuation recommendations in Malheur County have been lifted as of Thursday afternoon. In Baker County many areas’ evacuation levels were reduced or eliminated, according to the county’s Sheriff’s Office.
    

            In Alberta, two wildfires converged in the Jasper National Park area, forming what authorities are referring to as the Jasper Wildfire Complex. Officials say the losses are significant, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has deployed federal support to help battle the blaze.
    

            “Homes and businesses have been lost to a wildfire that people are calling a ‘wall of flames,’” Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said.
    

            In Jasper, a popular tourist town in Alberta, 25,000 residents and visitors were forced to evacuate from a fast-moving blaze, which has damaged nearly 40% of the town’s structures, officials said.
    

            “The pain our town is feeling is beyond comprehension. Our homes were full of memories and hubs for family, friendship and community,” Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said in a statement Saturday. “We have rallied many times in the past to support each other. I know this will be the darkest week in our community’s history. I am confident that together we will see brighter days are ahead.”

            It remains difficult to measure exactly how big the complex – which also includes a third nearby fire – is due to extreme fire behavior and thick smoke cover.
    

            “We will recover from this,” Smith said while holding back tears. “To those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost, and it never will be.”
    

            The owner of Maligne Lodge in Jasper told CNN news partner CTV News she was shocked when she saw a photo of the 98-room hotel up in flames. It had been in the family since 1961 after her father purchased the property, and she had been working there since she was a child.
    

            “As soon as we’re given the go-ahead, we’ll be in there rebuilding our hotel,” Karyn Decore said.
    

            “Significant amounts of rain” over three days has helped firefighters get a handle on many of the Alberta wildfires, Melissa Story, a provincial wildfire information officer with Alberta Wildfire, said during a news conference Sunday.
    

            But crews are preparing for warmer weather in the days ahead, which is expected to intensify the fires, especially in the southern areas of the province where rain was scarce.
    

            Nearly 4,000 firefighters are “on the front lines, battling the blaze” of the Park Fire, according to Cal Fire.
    

            The Park Fire is burning just three weeks after the Thompson Fire in Butte County burned more than 3,700 acres, forced people from their homes, and destroyed more than two dozen structures, including houses.

            “Yes, there’s a fire back there,” Paradise Mayor Lassonde told CNN affiliate KCRA, appearing to be distressed. “Yes, people’s houses are being destroyed. Yes, we’ve got over 1,000 firefighters out there, risking their lives, to keep us safe.”
    

            One Butte County evacuee, Tim Ferguson, said he lost his father in the Camp Fire, and it’s painful thinking about having to go through the experience again, according to an interview with CNN affiliate KOVR.
    

            “We’ve got our home, and we’ve been working on it a lot lately, fixing it up, and it’s just we’re at the verge of maybe losing all that,” Ferguson said.
    

            A heavy plume of smoke once again looms over the county as crews battle thick flames torching everything in their path. The Park Fire has left graveyards of burned cars and charred, hallowed out structures, video from the Chico and Cohasset areas of Butte County shows.
    

            A 42-year-old man identified by authorities as Ronnie Dean Stout II has been arrested on suspicion of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, “spreading flames” that caused the Park Fire. Stout will likely face an arson charge, though it’s unclear what count or whether enhancements will be added, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Thursday.
    

            The DA’s office told CNN Stout has not retained an attorney and will be assigned a public defender at his arraignment.
    

            Cal Fire initially estimated the fire had destroyed more than 100 structures, but on Saturday said crews on the ground have so far confirmed 20 structures destroyed.
    

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for both counties Friday. The state also secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure there are enough resources to fight the fire.
    

            Elsner said the Park Fire has forced her and her parents to take shelter at the same location they stayed at in 2018. She told CNN, in tears, the experience is causing her significant PTSD from the Camp Fire and flashbacks triggered by the flames and “charred bits of remnants.”
    

            Elsner’s mother, Mary Graeff, said it’s been challenging comforting her daughter through this. “It was just hard, you know, to be that age and then lose absolutely everything. So that was hard. And watching your child go through that was awful,” Graeff said through tears.

CNN_9,Olympic moment of the day: Cap-catching lifeguard steals the swimming show,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/sport/olympic-moment-lifeguard-swimming-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 11:16:00,world,"
            They say in sports to expect the unexpected.
    

            But really, who could have expected a lifeguard in a bright, multi-colored, very small swimsuit to jump into the pool at La Défense Arena on Sunday in front of 15,000 people – and be hailed as a hero.
    

            When American swimmer Emma Weber lost one of her swim caps in the pool, someone needed to fish it out. And it was up to the aforementioned hero lifeguard to plunge into the pool in front of thousands of fans to do the retrieval.

            To huge cheers from the crowd, the lifeguard dove into the pool and picked up the cap at the bottom. After a quick swim to the edge of the pool, he pulled himself out – and allowed himself a wave to his new flock of adoring fans.
    

            “This situation is common at swimming competitions,” a Paris 2024 spokesperson told CNN. “As the lifeguards are the only people wearing swimwear, apart from the athletes, a request may be made to fetch an item at the bottom of the pool prior to the next race. In this case, the request was made to the lifeguard closest to the item.”
    

            The lifeguard declined to allow his name to be reported, the spokesperson said, in order to keep his attention on his duties for the rest of the competition.
    

            Deemed “Bob the Cap Catcher” by NBC’s commentary crew, it was a moment of levity at one of the most pressure-packed venues at these Games. The atmosphere at La Défense Arena has been intense for the last two days of competitions, with many of the competitors remarking on the volume of cheers from the Paris crowd.
    

            It’s one of the great questions of every Olympics: What would it look like if the average human were to be in the same competition as these incredible athletes?
    

            For a brief moment on Sunday, we had a look of what that might be like. And it was glorious.

CNN_10,The arrest of two high-profile Sinaloa cartel leaders soon heads to the courtroom,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/sinaloa-cartel-arrests-monday/index.html,2024-07-29 12:10:00,us,"
            The stunning arrests of two central figures in the infamous Sinaloa cartel featured dramatic allegations of a high-level power struggle, the betrayal of one co-founder by another co-founder’s son and a secret flight ending in American law enforcement’s custody.
    

            Now comes the legal wrangling.
    

            Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, the cartel’s alleged co-founder, and Joaquin Guzmán López, son of former boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, were arrested Thursday by US authorities in El Paso, Texas. They face several charges for allegedly leading the criminal operations of what is considered to be one of the world’s most powerful and deadly drug trafficking operations.
    

            Zambada, 76, pleaded not guilty to all charges at his first federal court appearance Friday morning in El Paso and is being held without bond on seven federal criminal counts, including continuing criminal enterprise and money laundering. He also agreed to waive his right to personally appear and to ask for bond at a hearing set for July 31.
    

            “Typically, I do not comment on my criminal cases,” his attorney, Frank Pérez, told CNN. “However, I will say that my client did not come to the US voluntarily.”
    

            Guzmán López, 38, is expected to appear in federal court Tuesday in Chicago, his attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, told CNN. He was previously indicted by a federal grand jury in Illinois on narcotics, money laundering and firearms charges, according to a statement last year from the US Justice Department.

            “I’m looking forward to seeing Joaquin and working on the case with him,” Lichtman said in an email, adding he’d appear in court with Guzmán López.
    

            The cartel, one of the world’s most powerful narcotics trafficking organizations, is thought to be responsible for the trafficking of vast amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the United States. US Drug Enforcement Administration chief Anne Milgram said the arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”
    

            Officials told CNN the arrest came after Guzmán López duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest. Zambada thought the two were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate, but instead, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac, officials said.
    

            Zambada’s attorney offered a different explanation. In a phone conversation and a statement sent to CNN on Sunday, Pérez said Zambada was kidnapped.
    

            “Joaquín Guzmán López forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied, and a black bag was placed over his head,” Pérez said in a statement.
    

            “He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane, his legs tied to the seat by Joaquin, and brought to the US against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquín and my client.”
    

            Mexico’s president has called on the US to explain what exactly happened.
    

            “The government of the United States has to give a complete report. It can’t be just general statements,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday. “There has to be transparency.”
    

            A law enforcement source familiar with the situation told CNN US officials were hesitant to brief Mexican counterparts in advance due to fears the operation could have been compromised. Details on the operation were also highly restricted within the US government until Zambada and Guzmán López were taken into custody, the source said.
    

            The Mexican government has not responded to CNN’s request for comment on the matter.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel was founded in the late 1980s and led by El Chapo, who twice escaped from Mexican prisons before being detained by Mexican authorities in 2016.
    

            The cartel has been blamed for having a key role in the drug war that plagued Mexico for years, leaving tens of thousands of people dead, as well as contributing to the ongoing high levels of violence across the country.
    

            In the early 2010s, estimates indicated the cartel controlled roughly 40% to 60% of Mexico’s drug trade, earning as much as $3 billion annually, according to a Congressional Research Service report.


            El Chapo was extradited to the US in 2017 and convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, drug trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy to commit murder. He is serving a life sentence in US federal prison.
    

            Since then, experts believe the cartel has faced several challenges after breaking into factions – including some led by Zambada and Guzman’s sons – and with the rise of rival cartels.

What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders


            FBI Director Christopher Wray said both Zambada and Guzmán López had “eluded law enforcement for decades.”
    

            Zambada was indicted by a northern Illinois grand jury in 2009, according to the US State Department, and faces various criminal charges. In 2021, the US raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel,” according to the US State Department. “Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail.”
    

            Meanwhile, Guzmán López is one of the “Chapitos,” a term for the powerful sons of former cartel boss El Chapo.
    

            “The Chapitos are alleged to have repeatedly and consistently transported lethal amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl,” the Justice Department said last year.
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago. He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing.

CNN_11,"Venezuela strongman Nicolas Maduro reelected as president, election authorities say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/americas/venezuela-election-maduro-winner-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 12:55:00,world,"
            Nicolás Maduro, the authoritarian leader of Venezuela, has been reelected as president, the country’s election authority has announced, amid allegations of electoral irregularities by the opposition.
    

            With 80% of votes counted, the longtime strongman won more than 51% of the vote, besting the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who gained more than 44%, according to a statement by the National Electoral Council (CNE).
    

            Maduro will hold office for a third consecutive six-year term – representing the continuity of “Chavismo” in power, which started in 1999 at the hands of former president Hugo Chávez. Maduro has been in power since Chávez’s death in 2013.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that experienced the worst economic crash of a peacetime country in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Meanwhile, the opposition — which has been galvanized this election cycle, posing the most significant threat to Maduro’s grip on power in years — had promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy and rebuild the economy if they won.
    

            In the capital Caracas, opposition supporters were seen crying and hugging after the results were announced. Voters had turned out in droves, with many saying they would leave the country if Maduro won — pointing to violent repression and economic collapse under his rule.
    

            Earlier Sunday evening, opposition leaders claimed there were election irregularities — including opposition witnesses being denied access to the CNE headquarters as the authority counted votes, and the CNE allegedly halting data being sent from local polling stations to their central location to prevent more votes from being processed.
    

            Throughout the election process, there have been mounting concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied.
    

            CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not responded to the opposition’s allegations.
    

            After the CNE announced Maduro’s win, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the authority to publish its vote tabulations, saying it was “vitally important” that every vote is counted “fairly and transparently.”

CNN_12,Top Olympics official ‘deeply sorry’ for introducing South Korea as North Korea during opening ceremony,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/asia/north-south-korea-olympics-opening-ceremony-apology-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 12:29:00,world,"
Olympics organizers have “deeply apologized” to South Korea over a “human error” that saw its 143 athletes wrongly introduced as North Korean at the opening ceremony.
    

            The mishap occurred on Friday, when the South Korean athletes made their debut on a boat cruising down the River Seine. Both the French and English announcements falsely identified them as being from the “People’s Democratic Republic of Korea.”
    

            That’s the full name of North Korea. The official name of South Korea is the “Republic of Korea.”
    

            The error is politically sensitive for the two Koreas, which are still technically at war. The Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice, and no peace treaty has ever been signed.
    

            On Sunday, Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), spoke with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol on a call, according to a statement.
    

            “In this telephone call, the IOC President apologized sincerely for the mistake in the audio broadcast of the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 … in which the team of the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Korea … was wrongly identified,” it said.
    

            “The problem was identified as a human error, for which the IOC is deeply sorry,” it added.
    

            The phone call followed a more immediate apology from the Olympics body, which was issued shortly after the blunder on its official Korean-language account on X.
    

            At a press conference on Saturday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams called the incident “clearly deeply regrettable” and that the body “apologize[d] wholeheartedly,” Reuters reported.

            South Korea’s Sports Ministry has said it “expresses regret” over the introduction of the South Korean delegation during the opening broadcast.
    

            The 143 South Korean athletes are competing in 21 events. North Korea has sent 16 athletes to Paris after it dropped out of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which took place in 2021, over Covid-19 concerns. The country was subsequently banned from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing for unilaterally skipping the games in Japan.
    

            In recent weeks, tensions in the Korean Peninsula have flared up over thousands of garbage-laden balloons Pyongyang sent to South Korea, some of which have reached the grounds of the presidential compound in Seoul.
    

            Pyongyang has previously said it sent balloons south in response to a civilian campaign in South Korea to float balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda in the opposite direction.

CNN_13,Venezuelans anxiously await results in crucial presidential election as opposition signal high voter turnout,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-polls-open-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-29 12:06:00,world,"
            Venezuelans are anxiously awaiting the result of a highly consequential presidential election after casting their votes Sunday, in which the country’s longtime strongman, Nicolas Maduro, faces one of his greatest political challenges yet, say analysts.
    

            People began lining outside polling centers at dawn, casting votes throughout the day — though it remains unclear when the electoral authorities will announce the results.
    

            As night fell, many of those out on the streets voiced concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela and has been accused of rigging previous votes, which it denied.
    

            Experts had said that opposition party representatives will be present at each polling station to watch against vote tampering and to ensure fairness. But on Sunday night, the opposition’s main witness said she and other members had been denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) as it collates the results in the capital Caracas.
    

            Delsa Solórzano, president of the Citizen Encounter Party, part of a larger opposition coalition, also said CNE had stopped sending voting data from polling stations to the central authority, to prevent more votes from being processed. She added that she had tried contacting the CNE, without any response.
    

            CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not yet commented on the allegations.
    

            Maduro, who took the mantle of the ruling Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office. Of the nine other candidates running for the presidency, his biggest challenger is a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform.

The woman behind Venezuela’s upstart opposition movement


            The opposition movement has maintained its momentum despite sustained government repression, in which their first-choice candidate, María Corina Machado, was disqualified from running. Machado, an avowed capitalist who has promised privatization of several state industries, has since rallied for her replacement, the soft-spoken former diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, which has experienced violent repression under Maduro’s watch and the worst economic collapse of a peacetime country in recent history. The oil-rich nation, once the fifth-largest economy in Latin America, has seen its economy shrink in the last decade to the equivalent of a medium-sized city, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. 


            Punishing sanctions on the regime by the United States and European Union have failed to topple the populist incumbent, who argues that Venezuela’s woes are due to being a victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Around eight million Venezuelans have fled the country amid shortages of vital goods and soaring inflation, and others will feel compelled to leave if Maduro wins, says the opposition coalition that has promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy.
    

            Fleeing Venezuelans “would create huge pressure and destabilization in the region. And of course, in the south border of the United States, but in the country,” opposition leader Machado said Sunday, adding that an opposition victory would bring “millions of Venezuelans … back home.”
    

            On Sunday, some voters in Caracas appeared optimistic for change. “[After] 25 years, I see that there is a real chance to change. I see a lot of people getting together to vote,” voter Mariana Schemel said.
    

            “I’m doing this for my children and my grandchildren,” voter Amelia Perez told CNN. She has three sons, one of whom is living in Washington, D.C. “I want him to come back and I don’t want my children to leave. All the rest of my family already left.”
    

            Voters came out in droves to vote on Sunday, according to the opposition coalition. Outside a polling station in Caracas, Venezuelans chanted “we want to vote” as they waited for hours in line to get to the ballot box. Abroad, Venezuelan expatriates rallied in Miami, Florida, and the Peruvian capital Lima.

            More than 21 million people are registered to vote, both in the country and abroad. The opposition coalition reported later on Sunday afternoon a 54.8% voter turnout, representing at least 11.7 million voters.
    

            “This is huge. If this continues, it will be a historic participation figure,” Machado said in a statement released Sunday afternoon. “What you are seeing is the most important civic act in our history.”
    

            There were also minor “problems” at some voting stations, including a small number of stations that couldn’t be set up and delays in processing voters’ ID cards, Machado said.
    

            And in Caracas, 55-year-old voter Henrique Mendoza told CNN he was turned away from a polling center by soldiers for wearing cargo shorts, after queuing for hours – despite the CNE previously saying there is no dress code for polling centers.
    

            When Maduro voted at 6 a.m. in the capital, he urged citizens to respect the results of the election. His main challenger González said the opposition coalition is “going to wait for the results from the National Electoral Council, however, we also have our methods and mechanisms to know the progress of today’s electoral process.”

            The election campaign has seen at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government has also created significant impediments for the millions of Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements. Only 69,211 Venezuelans living abroad are eligible to vote in this year’s poll, according to data published by the CNE.
    

            A limited group of election observers, including a team from The Carter Center – a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter – will be on the ground. But several international election observers have announced this week that they will no longer travel to Venezuela to monitor the vote.
    

            Latin American leaders, including Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have called on Maduro to commit to stepping down if he loses. Venezuelan opposition figures have also appealed to the country’s military, that has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, to respect the results. The Venezuelan leader has said his victory will ensure “peace” in the country.
    

            The Biden administration has been monitoring the elections, telling reporters on Friday that the US stands prepared to levy additional sanctions against Venezuela if the democratic process is not allowed to unfold.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris said “the will of the Venezuelan people must be respected” in a post on X, adding that “despite the many challenges, we will continue to work toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future for the people of Venezuela.”
    

            How the army reacts to the outcome could be an important factor in any scenario, but analysts say it impossible to parse where it stands.
    

            “The military is absolutely key. But I must also say that the military is very hermetic, [and] it is very difficult to access information about what it is thinking,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program Director of Venezuela Program at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN.

            Throughout the election process, there have been mounting concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela including the Supreme Court – which could be the final arbiter on any claim of electoral fraud. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.
    

            Voters had turned out in droves, with many saying they would leave the country if Maduro won — pointing to violent repression and economic collapse under his rule.
    

            The results were met with mixed emotions in the capital Caracas, with Maduro supporters cheering and celebrating outside the president’s official residence. Meanwhile, opposition supporters were seen crying and hugging on the streets.

CNN_15,Firefighters cautiously watch the weather as Western wildfires spread,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-paradise-california-chico/index.html,2024-07-29 14:39:00,us,"
Wildfires are burning across the Western United States and Canada, damaging homes, causing injuries and forcing evacuations. The largest active wildfire in the US has scorched more than 360,000 acres – an area larger than the city of Phoenix – and firefighters are watching to see if the weather will help give them an advantage. Here is the latest:


            • Hope for stopping wildfires’ spread: The weather forecast for the Northwest calls for lighter winds than the area has seen in recent days, giving firefighters some optimism about slowing the progress of the Park Fire, along with more than 100 large wildfires are burning across the region, consuming thousands of acres. Temperatures across much of the West will actually be at or below average to start this week, with forecast highs through Tuesday range between the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and the 70s and 80s in the inland Pacific Northwest.
    

            • Park Fire is largest active wildfire in the US: The Park Fire, the seventh-largest wildfire in California history, is now at more than 360,000 acres or 560 square miles. The fire has destroyed 100 structures and threatens thousands more, according to Cal Fire. It was 12% contained as of Monday morning but evacuations warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. Lower winds from the south could help take pressure off the fire’s eastern edge. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official.
    

            • Arson suspect to be arraigned Monday: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the Park Fire. The man is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, spreading flames that caused the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.

            • Progress fighting Durkee Fire in Oregon: The Durkee Fire is the largest wildfire burning in Oregon, at more than 288,000 acres. It has injured three people and destroyed four residences. The fire was 49% contained as of Monday morning, according to InciWeb, and the figure could improve as winds calm and humidity levels moderate.
    

            • Crews to see more challenges in Jasper, Alberta: Though weekend rain helped firefighters combat the Jasper Wildfire Complex – the park’s largest wildfire in more than a century – warmer weather in the days ahead might present further challenges. Temperatures in the area have dropped and there is a chance of showers Monday, with highs expected in the upper 60s to mid-70s and rising through the week. Wildfire danger for the southern areas of the province remain very high to extreme, according to Melissa Story, spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. “This area did not see the moisture as the other areas of the province did,” Story said.
    

            Cloud and smoke coverage allowed firefighters to increase containment lines around the Park Fire Saturday, but the challenges returned on Sunday, Cal Fire Incident Commander Billy See said.
    

            While some areas were downgraded from evacuation orders to warnings, spot fires prevented officials from lifting or changing more orders and warnings, officials said.
    

            “We are working really hard to get people back into their house as soon as possible,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea.

            Jeremy Hollingshead, a firefighter and spokesman for Yuba City Fire Department, told CNN conditions have not been favorable for crews.
    

            “It was a wind-driven fire, it was a topography-driven fire, fuel-driven fire, everything was stacked against us,” Hollingshead said. “At that point in time, we threw everything we had at it, but again, we’re not going to put anybody at the head of this thing. What we had to do was put crews in the high-risk areas, where structures could possibly burn and do the best work they can there.”
    

            He added firefighters took advantage of more favorable conditions to try and get a better handle on the blaze.
    

            “Firefighters right now, from the sky to the ground, they’re taking advantage of the break we do have in the weather, so hopefully in the next few days we can mitigate a lot of that threat,” Hollingshead said.
    

            Chico, California, the largest city in Butte County where the Park Fire is ongoing, will see temperatures in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday, a significant drop from the triple digit temperatures of last week. Winds continue to decrease for the Park Fire area as well, with sustained winds below 10 mph Monday, and as low as 5 mph by Tuesday.
    

            There is even a weak storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest, expected to bring some shower chances. This amount of rainfall is helpful as it doesn’t lead to as great of flash flooding risk for burn scars.
    

            The massive Park Fire, believed to be the result of arson, forced thousands to flee their homes as it exploded after igniting Wednesday near Chico, California, consuming thousands of acres per hour, burning dozens of structures and leaving behind graveyards of burned trees and cars.
    

            Retired Chico firefighter John Maretti told CNN he has lost his house in the Park Fire despite preparing as best he knew how.
    

            “I bought a bulldozer. We cleared things out. We made sure that we had a Class A roof and non-flammable walls. We did a lot. We had sprinklers. We had hoses. I mean, I’m a firefighter. I set this up for maximum opportunity for the house to make it and it did not, Maretti said. “There’s just no way that anybody could have survived with this house.”
    

            Despite the destruction of his property, Maretti said he felt fortunate the household – including two dogs and a cat – had escaped unharmed, something he put down in part to breaking his ankle last Monday.
    

            “I felt very capable staying. And I have hoses, I have all sorts of equipment, but with a broken ankle, there’s just no choice. I had to leave. And fortunately, because I had the broken ankle, I probably saved my life, because I probably would have stayed and tried to fight it, which would have been the wrong decision,” he said.
    

            Maretti said the speed at which the fire had spread wasn’t what he was used to.
    

            “So this was just a lot faster fire than I’d ever seen,” Maretti said. “This is just an angry fire, and completely different than anything I’ve ever seen before.”
    

            A Tehama County resident described to CNN affiliate KOVR fleeing the Park Fire on the only exit road out of their neighborhood – which the blaze had already jumped.
    

            “When we saw the fire coming over the ridge, which it did, it was coming at us. We thought that was bad. And then we put everything in the car and took off,” Jim Young told KOVR.
    

            “We get on the highway and it is burning on both sides for 10 miles. It was like driving through an inferno,” Young said.
    

            The Park Fire is burning in Butte County, where California’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            Bruce Hey and his brother-in-law Christopher Apel told KOVR that the blaze had forced them to evacuate their adjoining properties in the Cohasset area.
    

            “We had a lot of people who were staying there from the Camp Fire and … and everything is burning,” Apel told KOVR.
    

            Hey said that he drove through the blaze to safety, but burned his arm in the process.
    

            “I tried to outrun it,” he said. “I wouldn’t have gotten burned if I hadn’t rolled down the window to look in the rearview mirror. I was right in the middle of it and I was trying to put it in reverse.”
    

            Jasper, a popular tourist town in the middle of Alberta’s Jasper National Park, has seen widespread destruction due to the wildfire there, which has scorched just under 90,000 acres.
    

            The park remains closed and more than 17,000 people are still under evacuation orders, Jose Tilney, deputy managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday afternoon.
    

            Almost 40% of all structures in the city have been destroyed by the Jasper Wildlife Complex fire, data released Saturday by the Municipality of Jasper show.
    

            Of the 1,113 structures in the town, 410 were reported to be destroyed, and 10 sustained visible damage, the Jasper Rapid Visual Damage Assessment said.
    

            The fire remains “out-of-control and is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather,” Parks Canada said.

CNN_16,"Both Venezuela strongman Nicolas Maduro and opposition claim election win, as US voices ‘serious concerns’",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/americas/venezuela-election-maduro-winner-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 14:50:00,world,"
            Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his political opponents both claimed to have won the presidential election on Monday, as the United States and multiple regional nations voiced skepticism about official results handing victory to the strongman leader.
    

            With 80% of votes counted, Maduro won more than 51% of the vote, besting the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who gained more than 44%, according to a statement by the National Electoral Council (CNE).
    

            But the opposition painted a very different picture of the results. Opposition leader María Corina Machado said in a news conference that their own records showed their candidate Edmundo González Urrutia had received 70% of the vote against Maduro’s 30%.
    

            “We won, and everyone knows it,” Machado said, adding that the opposition would “defend the truth.”
    

            “The entire international community knows what happened in Venezuela and how people voted for change,” she said.

            Gonzalez, also at the news conference, alleged that rules had been violated during the election.
    

            If Maduro takes office, it will be for a third consecutive six-year term – representing the continuity of “Chavismo” in power, which started in 1999 at the hands of former president Hugo Chávez. Maduro has been in power since Chávez’s death in 2013.
    

            The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that experienced the worst economic crash of a peacetime country in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”
    

            Meanwhile, the opposition — which has been galvanized this election cycle, posing the most significant threat to Maduro’s grip on power in years — had promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy and rebuild the economy if they won.
    

            Throughout the election process, there have been mounting concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela including the Supreme Court – which could be the final arbiter on any claim of electoral fraud. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.
    

            Voters had turned out in droves, with many saying they would leave the country if Maduro won — pointing to violent repression and economic collapse under his rule.
    

            After the results were announced, Maduro described it as a “triumph of peace, stability, republican ideals, and the ideas of equality.”
    

            “They could not overcome the sanctions, they could not overcome the aggressions, the threats, they could not now and will never be able to overcome the dignity of the people of Venezuela,” he said during his public speech, referring to his political opponents.
    

            The results announced by the election authorities were met with mixed emotions in the capital Caracas, with Maduro supporters cheering and celebrating outside the president’s official residence. Meanwhile, opposition supporters were seen crying and hugging on the streets.
    

            Earlier Sunday evening, opposition leaders claimed there were election irregularities — including opposition witnesses being denied access to the CNE headquarters as the authority counted votes, and the CNE allegedly halting data being sent from local polling stations to their central location to prevent more votes from being processed.
    

            The run up to the vote was also marred by allegations of foul play.
    

            The election campaign saw at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets were blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.
    

            The government a﻿lso created significant impediments for Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements.
    

            CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not responded to the opposition’s allegations.
    

            After the CNE announced Maduro’s win, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed “serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.”
    

            He added that it was “critical” for votes to be counted fairly and transparently, and called for the CNE to publish its vote tabulations.
    

            The opposition’s accusations may cast doubt on Venezuela returning to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.

            The results were also met with mixed reactions across the region. The presidents of Peru, Chile, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Argentina and Uruguay, all either denounced or cast doubt on the results, with several saying they would not recognize Maduro’s win. Ahead of the election, many Latin American leaders had urged Maduro to commit to stepping down if he lost.
    

            But some of Venezuela’s partners congratulated Maduro on his win, including the Bolivian, Honduran and Cuban presidents.
    

            Earlier Sunday night, a government statement shared online by the Venezuelan foreign minister decried what it called foreign “intervention” against the election, pointing the finger at a number of countries that had criticized the results – including Argentina, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru and more.

CNN_17,North Korea’s Kim ‘inspects’ flood response as thousands evacuated from China border region after heavy rains,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/asia/north-korea-flooding-kim-jong-un-china-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-29 15:16:00,world,"
            Some 5,000 people were rescued from flood-hit areas along North Korea’s border with China over the weekend in efforts supervised by leader Kim Jong Un, the country’s state media reported Monday.
    

            The North Korean army launched emergency operations in North Pyongan province as the region reeled from flooding in the wake of heavy rains that left 5,000 people “isolated” and at risk, according to state media KCNA.
    

            Water levels at the Amnok River, or Yalu River in Chinese, which forms part of the border between the North Korea and China, had “far exceeded the danger line” due to record rains Saturday, KCNA reported, noting Kim’s assessment that flooding was “very serious” in Sinuiju City, which faces the Chinese city of Dandong.
    

            Kim – who was pictured in images published by state media striding, windswept through an air base handling rescue and riding in an SUV through flood waters – was described as “inspecting and directing” efforts and criticizing authorities that failed to properly prepare for and prevent the disaster.
    

            The autocrat’s appearance at the scene suggests the significance of the floods – and his desire to be seen at the fore of response to what he called “disastrous abnormal weather.”
    

            It comes as governments across Asia are grappling with devastation and economic loss caused by extreme weather that scientists say is growing more frequent due to human-driven climate change.
    

            Heavy rains and flooding hit wide swaths of Asia in recent days as a major storm system swept through the region. Typhoon Gaemi contributed to major flooding in parts of the Philippines and then Taiwan last week, before the storm made landfall in China’s Fujian Province Thursday evening local time and later downgraded in intensity.
    

            In its wake, parts of coastal and central China saw substantial flooding in recent days with heavy rains moving north over the weekend, extending what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across the country, where the typical flooding season began two months early.

            At least 15 people died following a rain-triggered landslide in central China’s Hunan Province, Chinese state media Xinhua said Sunday.
    

            China’s northeast – a key food-growing region which traditionally had been less effected by frequent flooding – is also grappling with heavy rains.
    

            In China’s Liaoning province, across the border from North Korea’s North Pyongan, more than 45,000 people were evacuated from their homes as of Sunday morning as heavy rains hit the region, according to Xinhua.
    

            Hundreds of chemical enterprises and mining companies across the province also suspended operations over the weekend and relocated to avoid flood risks, Xinhua said.
    

            Southwest Liaoning remains under an orange rainstorm alert for heavy to torrential rain until Tuesday afternoon, according to China’s weather authority.

CNN_18,Big worries over River Seine’s water quality as triathlon training canceled again,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/sport/worries-seine-water-quality-olympic-triathlon-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 16:35:00,world,"
            The rain that drenched Friday’s opening ceremony may have moved out of Paris, but its effects are still being felt in the River Seine, with water quality concerns throwing the triathlon competition into uncertainty.
    

            The decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world’s best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.
    

            It was a risky move: pollution in the Seine typically jumps after heavy rains like the ones that fell in the French capital throughout Friday and most of the day Saturday. Training was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes.
    

            Still, organizers are confident the race will go ahead as planned. The men’s triathlon is scheduled for Tuesday and the women’s triathlon is scheduled for Wednesday. The contingency dates for those races are Thursday and Friday, respectively.
    

            “Given the weather forecast for the next 36 hours, Paris 2024 and World Triathlon are confident that water quality will return to below limits before the start of the triathlon competitions on July 30,” a joint statement from Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said.
    

            The Paris area is set for its first heat wave of the summer this week that will hit at the same time as the triathlon.
    

            Both high temperatures and low temperatures are expected to be well above average for the next several days leading France’s meteorological department, Meteo-France, to issue orange heat warnings beginning Monday at noon local time for 39 separate locations. In Paris and the Paris region, low temperatures will increase over the days, between 18 and 22°C (64 and 71°F). High temperatures will reach 34 to 36°C (93 and 97°F) on Tuesday and Wednesday, the days the triathlon is scheduled.
    

            There is a chance of scattered thunderstorms in the afternoon on both Tuesday and Wednesday as well.
    

            About $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river’s water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.
    

One of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin – called the Austerlitz basin – which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.
    

            Following rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.
    

            But the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 – following rain the previous day – E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.
    

            That’s double the level needed for “good” water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.
    

            For much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization’s medical committee decides the race can go ahead.
    

            The individual triathlon races will begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-Élysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.
    

            A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.

CNN_19,"Biden to call for major Supreme Court reforms, including term limits, at Civil Rights Act event Monday",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/biden-supreme-court-reform/index.html,2024-07-29 17:33:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden is set to call for major Supreme Court reforms Monday, according to a White House official, a move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation’s highest court operates.
    

            Biden’s election-year push comes amid deep unpopularity for the high court but stands little chance of going anywhere. He will call for a constitutional amendment stripping the president of immunity for crimes committed while in office, term limits for Supreme Court justices, and a binding code of conduct for the high court, the White House official said.
    

            Biden’s announcement, which he is set to make at an event in Austin, Texas, commemorating the Civil Rights Act, follows this month’s monumental decision by the Supreme Court granting presidents full immunity for some actions taken while in office and after a tide of revelations about justices accepting vacations and gifts from wealthy conservative donors. Democrats on the campaign trail frequently point to the Supreme Court’s conservative majority – solidified by former President Donald Trump – to underscore what they see as the high stakes of the 2024 election.
    

            The White House official said Biden will call for an amendment dubbed the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” which will state the Constitution “does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President.”

Analysis: Biden’s 41-year evolution on Supreme Court reform


            In what would be another change to the Constitution, Biden will also call for term limits for Supreme Court justices, who serve lifetime appointments.
    

            The reforms Biden is proposing would require congressional approval, which would be difficult to achieve before his term ends, as Republicans control the House and Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate. The constitutional amendment, meanwhile, would require a more complicated process involving the states that seems nearly impossible to succeed.
    

            The reforms, which will face heavy resistance, are meant to “restore trust and accountability when it comes to the presidency and the United States Supreme Court,” the White House official said.
    

            CNN reported this month that Biden was seriously considering endorsing major Supreme Court reforms, actions that liberal lawmakers and groups have been pushing in recent years.
    

            The Monday announcement will come more than three years after Biden created a commission to study structural changes at the Supreme Court, including term limits and proposals to increase the number of justices. The group submitted its report to the White House in late 2021, but the administration did not pursue any of the ideas discussed in the document.
    

            The debate over proposed structural changes at the Supreme Court has become deeply partisan, with Republicans widely opposed. But the issue has drawn renewed attention after it was reported in May that controversial flags were previously hoisted on properties owned by conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Both of the flags were flown by rioters during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, though Alito has denied any connection to that incident and has said his wife hoisted them for different reasons – including a spat with neighbors.
    

            Meanwhile, the court handed down several controversial decisions this summer that drew sharp criticism on the left, including the stunning 6-3 ruling that granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan


            Last year, the high court adopted its own code of conduct. But the measure was heavily criticized by ethics experts because it included no way to enforce its requirements. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan defended the code of conduct in remarks last week but also conceded it would be more effective if it included an enforcement mechanism.
    

            Biden’s proposal comes as polling indicates support for the court is hovering near historic lows. A Marquette Law School poll in May found that 61% of Americans disapprove of the job the court is doing. Just four years ago, the same poll found the court had a 66% approval rating.
    

            Democrats have sought to use public disapproval of the court – particularly its 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade – to drive voters. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, have made that decision a central part of their campaign arguments, hoping the issue of abortion rights will galvanize voters heading into November.
    

            Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has resisted calls from his party to expand the court, has become increasingly critical of its makeup. He has described the Supreme Court as “out of kilter” and has warned of the impact a second Trump presidency could have on the nation’s highest court.
    

            Biden, who is making his first trip since bowing out of the 2024 race, will call for the changes at the presidential library honoring President Lyndon B. Johnson, who ended his own reelection bid in 1968. Biden will also use his remarks to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that cemented Johnson’s legacy.

CNN_20,Harris sees opening in Vance as she considers her own pick for vice president,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/kamala-harris-jd-vance-vp-pick/index.html,2024-07-29 18:00:00,us,"
Kamala Harris’ plan as a running mate was to brush past JD Vance as nothing but a rubber stamp for Donald Trump. But now that she’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, her campaign is seizing on the Ohio senator as a major liability, looking to her own vice presidential selection process and the contenders’ public auditions to drive home the point.
    

            Vance’s elevation — despite his relative lack of government experience — is giving Harris a new opportunity to go after Trump. The message is not just that Vance is “weird,” as the vice president said at a fundraiser this weekend, or that he has objectionable views, advisers said; it’s that the Ohio senator shouldn’t be a heartbeat away from the presidency, and that Trump picking him raises more questions about the top of the ticket.
    

            The strategy is also a way to put Trump’s age in focus, now that President Joe Biden is not part of the conversation, by highlighting how close Vance could be to occupying the Oval Office if something were to happen to a 78-year-old president. And poking holes in Vance’s resume — as some potential Harris running mates are doing — is a way for them to argue that Republicans are holding the presumptive Democratic nominee to a different standard when they attack her as a “DEI hire.”

Trump and Harris enter final 100-day stretch of a rapidly evolving 2024 race


            “We have a Black woman, we have a White guy, and nobody asked the white guy” about experience, Harris campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN.
    

            After Vance was announced as Trump’s pick and while Democrats were still waiting to see whether Biden would exit the race, Harris told several advisers she saw Trump’s choice as doubling down on his MAGA base rather than expanding the appeal of the ticket. She and her team were excited to face Vance as opposed to the others on the former president’s short list, eager to tag him as a hypocrite and Trump sycophant.
    

            But now, as her prospective running mates take turns whacking Vance over his controversial comments about women without children and his flip-flopping on Trump, as well as questioning his Appalachian roots, Harris’ team is holding Vance up against the people on her own short list to try to strike a contrast.
    

            The 39-year-old Ohio Republican is “one of the most unprepared people that we have ever put up to hold the vice presidency of the United States,” Landrieu said, with qualifications that don’t go much beyond the constitutional minimum of being a naturally born American citizen who is 35 years old.
    

            “He didn’t even run a business. He’s never run anything. And he’s about to be one heartbeat away from the largest entity in the world, and the one that’s the most important,” Landrieu said. “So it’s a fair question to ask: How would we know whether you have the capability to run domestic and national security policy for the most powerful country in the world, which you may be called to do on a moment’s notice?”
    

            Harris, who was first elected to the Senate in 2016, spent as much time in the chamber as Vance, who was first elected in 2022, before she started preparing in 2018 to run for president. And while Vance has won statewide office, those on Harris’ short list — which includes several governors, a senator and one Cabinet secretary — have served more time in government than Vance and have leadership experience in a variety of previous offices, business and the military (and NASA).
    

            Cedric Richmond, the former Louisiana congressman and Biden White House adviser who also serves as a campaign co-chair, said he is “terrified” to think about Vance being in a position to become president overnight.
    

            Several people hoping to get picked as Harris’ ticket mate echoed that message as they angle for the job.
    

            “I’ve done a lot of hiring in my life — in business and nonprofits, in government — and it’s pretty obvious when someone’s resume shows that they can’t hold down a job or haven’t held down a job for more than a year or two at a time, that there’s something wrong with them,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who’s among those being vetted, referring to Vance’s brief stints in business positions before jumping into the 2022 Senate race in Ohio.

Vance confronts upheaval and uncertainty in first 10 days as Trump’s running mate


            Pritzker said that not only are the potential Democratic picks more experienced, but they also have been more consistent in their positions than Vance, who has shifted from worrying privately eight years ago that Trump could be “America’s Hitler” to saying he was won over completely by how Trump performed as president.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — who ran for president four years ago after serving as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana — made a similar point between interviews in his own public auditioning to move up Harris’ list.
    

            “I’m somebody who believes that younger people can bring something to the table,” said the 42-year-old Buttigieg, who argued that his relatively few years in government service weren’t an issue since Trump had changed the game for what counted as political experience. “But I think when you have no executive experience at all, certainly not in public administration, and very little experience in public office in general, that’s a real concern.”
    

            Trump communications director Steven Cheung called Vance “the best choice to be the next vice president of the United States, while Kamala has been cosplaying the role since she was selected by Biden.”
    

            He attacked Harris as “the most unserious presidential candidate in a generation,” adding, “No matter who Kamala chooses, she can’t whitewash her dismal record serving as Biden’s failed border czar, overseeing out-of-control inflation, and releasing violent criminals back into communities.”
    

            While former Attorney General Eric Holder is supervising the official vetting for Harris, the actual decision-making is kept to a tight circle around the vice president, led by her campaign chief of staff, Sheila Nix, and her vice presidential office chief of staff, Lorraine Voles. They’re making many of the calls themselves, and getting even more from old and new friends assured of their own political expertise as they push their preferred picks.
    

            Harris, 59, has the unique experience of leading a selection process only four years after going through it herself.

Here’s what a Harris presidency could look like


            That process — and the way she then had to navigate the job under intense scrutiny — has been on her mind in conversations with, among others, Biden and former President Barack Obama, people familiar with her thinking told CNN, with Biden’s forceful comments about her readiness resonating for her as she makes this choice.
    

            Though she will be looking not just at what jobs the contenders held but also what they did in those positions, advisers say her process is not going to be as simple as comparing resumes.
    

            “We’re in a position where somebody has done the job of vice president,” a Harris adviser told CNN. “She knows the challenges of this world in a way that you have to have somebody who has a deep amount of resilience.”
    

            Those considerations are intertwined with immediate concerns that she has continued to stress in internal meetings: needing to unify the party and remember that, despite her meteoric first week as a candidate, “We’re the underdogs in this race,” as she put it at a fundraiser in Massachusetts on Saturday afternoon.
    

            As was the case when Biden was in his final deliberations about her four years ago, Harris believes that the foremost factor has to be who is going to help her win, her advisers say.
    

            “Harris will select a vice president who is qualified and ready to serve the American people, protect their freedoms, and fight for their future,” said campaign spokesperson James Singer, again trying to paint a contrast by reiterating a charge Harris herself has made — that Trump picked Vance because he supported his bid to overturn the 2020 election.
    

            With Biden out of the race, Trump is now the much older candidate. He is overweight, known to love fast food and has a philosophical objection to exercise. He has never released his full medical records.
    

            To Harris aides, that makes who he picked as a running mate an even more pressing issue.
    

            When then-Arizona Sen. John McCain picked then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate in 2008, he faced charges of recklessness for selecting someone with so little experience, given that he was then the oldest first-time presidential nominee and had already been through a bout of cancer. McCain in 2008 was about six years younger than Trump is now. Palin had a few more months as governor of Alaska — and before that, as mayor and a City Council member of her little town of Wasilla — than Vance has spent in the Senate.

            Trump is the only American president elected without previous government or military experience. And even if he picked Vance to be less of a governing partner than someone who could carry on his political movement, Trump has said he believes the Ohio Republican would be a good president.
    

            Asked about Democrats highlighting Trump’s age, his national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, made an argument similar to one Democrats were making just a few weeks ago: “It’s not about age, it’s about competence.”
    

            Still, that doesn’t change the actuarial realities that Democrats are much more eager to talk about now that they’re no longer defending Biden.
    

            “It has to make you wonder about Donald Trump’s judgment. He knows how old he is,” Pritzker said. “And so the idea that he would pick somebody a heartbeat away from the presidency, with so little experience — and in particular has so little experience running anything — it should just raise a lot of questions in people’s minds.”
    

            “Given questions about President Trump’s health, as well as his advanced age, the selection of a running mate here is as important as any since FDR’s last campaign — and JD Vance is no Harry Truman,” Buttigieg said.
    

            Roosevelt was 62 during his last campaign in 1944.
    

            “Father Time is undefeated,” Richmond said, “and [Vance] being that close to it, with that amount of experience and with the lack of seriousness or appreciation for the job — that should concern a lot of people.”

CNN_21,These homeowners are ‘hacking’ their pools and lawns to earn extra cash,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/economy/home-hacking-to-offset-costs/index.html,2024-07-29 18:00:00,us,"
            The first time Alexis Hammond rented out her Baltimore home on Peerspace, a marketplace for renting homes and other spaces by the hour, a film crew and a celebrity arrived to shoot a Wawa commercial.
    

            “There was a Baltimore Ravens football player here, so that was very exciting,” Hammond said.
    

            Within the first few weeks of listing her home, Hammond, a psychiatrist, earned enough to cover her mortgage payment that month. Since then, she’s rented out her home on Peerspace for everything from photoshoots to baby showers — starting at $100 an hour.
    

            Purchasing a home has become more difficult for many Americans, but it’s considered one of the best ways to build wealth. And in recent years, homeowners have been presented with an expanding universe of opportunities to monetize these existing assets even further: For those lucky enough to have them, underused pools, backyards, living rooms or driveways can offer untapped riches.
    

             “It’s kind of like passive income, besides some cleaning you have to do,” Hammond said.
    

            Platforms for traditional overnight stays, like Airbnb and Vrbo, have been popular for years. Now, newer offerings allow homeowners to rent out portions of their homes on an even shorter-term basis, often by the hour.
    

            One of these platforms is Swimply, an online marketplace for private pool rentals that launched in 2020, just as the pandemic halted travel and more people looked to get their kicks locally.
    

            Michael Kukuk, an executive at an oil and gas company in Houston, lists his pool on the platform for $60 an hour on weekdays and $67 on weekends. He sometimes nets four to five different bookings in a single weekend during the summer months. He said he has already made $13,000 so far this summer, and his best year was 2022, when he earned $26,000 from the platform.

            Renting out his pool has proven to be a lucrative way to use a piece of his property that may not have seen much use otherwise, Kukuk said: “I always wanted to have a pool and I don’t use it as often as I thought I would. The income is great, and I also like being able to share it with people.”
    

            Swimply recently launched passes, which allow homeowners to charge users a monthly fee for access to their pool, tennis court or even home gym, turning their homes into full-blown businesses.
    

            “We’re helping offset costs and generate income,” Derek Callow, Swimply’s CEO, told CNN.
    

            Swimply and Peerspace are just two of the many very-short-term rental marketplaces offering this premise.
    

            As the cost of owning a home has risen, so have the opportunities to monetize it. Peer-to-peer rental marketplaces of all kinds have popped up: RentMyCourt (private tennis and pickleball court rentals), SniffSpot (backyard rentals for dogs), CurbFlip (driveway and parking space rentals) and Vanly (driveway and shower rentals for people traveling in camper vans or RVs).
    

Younger homebuyers are keenly aware of the opportunity to offset their expenses with extra cash. According to a Zillow survey from last year, 55% of Millennial homebuyers and 51% of Gen Z buyers consider it very or extremely important to have the opportunity to rent out part of their home for extra income while living in it.
    

            Marketplaces are benefiting from that generational shift. Peerspace has been around for a decade — but its listings of active residences jumped 60% over the last year, said founder Rony Chammas.
    

            While the extra income is a focus for many homeowners, some participating in this budding industry say they’ve found something unexpected: community.
    

            Leslie Garabedian said she usually makes between $2,000 and $4,000 a month by renting out her West Caldwell, New Jersey, backyard for dogs and their owners on SniffSpot. Still, she said the circle of dog lovers she has met from the experience has been just as valuable.
    

            “Extra money is great, but that is not my sole focus for doing this,” said Garabedian, manager at a dental practice. “I love the fact that I’m providing to these people and to these dogs. That brings me so much joy.”
    

            Garabedian said that when one of her own dogs passed away last month, other dog owners who rent out her backyard showed up for her.
    

            “There was an outpouring of love and people sending me gifts,” she said. “When everybody has the same focus, which is their dog, you can create amazing relationships.”

CNN_22,"Women and girls in Sudan subjected to widespread sexual violence by warring parties, report finds",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/africa/sudan-sexual-violence-women-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 17:42:00,world,"
            One woman sleeps with a knife under her pillow, in the hope she can protect herself against armed men who might storm her house at night. Another was raped “repeatedly for days” along with her four daughters, while her husband and sons were forced to watch. Another was thrown out of her home and separated from her children after her husband discovered she had become pregnant by rape.
    

            These are among the horrific accounts of sexual violence committed against women and girls in Sudan by the east African country’s warring parties – particularly the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – in the capital Khartoum since fighting began last year, as detailed in a major report from Human Rights Watch (HRW).
    

            Since civil war broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF rebels, swaths of the city have been reduced to rubble, as the SAF has bombed civilian neighborhoods to try to dislodge the RSF from its entrenched positions. The conflict has spilled into other parts of the country too, including its western Darfur region.
    

            The United Nations has described the situation in Sudan as “one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory,” with more than 6 million Sudanese internally displaced, 1.5 million seeking safety abroad, and nearly 26 million people – more than half of the population – at risk of famine.
    

            During 15 months of conflict, women and girls in the capital have been subjected to widespread acts of rape, including gang rape, as well as forced marriages and sexual slavery, according to HRW’s 88-page report, titled “Khartoum is Not Safe for Women” and released on July 29.
    

            ​​“The Rapid Support Forces have raped, gang raped, and forced into marriage countless women and girls in residential areas in Sudan’s capital,” said Laetitia Bader, deputy Africa director at HRW.
    

            “The armed group has terrorized women and girls and both warring parties have blocked them from getting aid and support services, compounding the harm they face and leaving them to feel that nowhere is safe,” she added.
    

            CNN is seeking comment from both the RSF and the SAF on the allegations contained in the HRW report.
    

            Due to the difficulty in accessing Khartoum and speaking to survivors directly, HRW instead interviewed 42 healthcare providers, social workers and other responders between September 2023 and February 2024. Of those, 18 had provided direct care to a total of 262 survivors of sexual violence, aged from 9 through 60.
    

            One psychiatrist, who supported more than 40 rape victims between April and November last year, recalled a survivor who had been raped and then discovered she was three months pregnant.
    

            “She was clearly traumatized and shivering – afraid of how her family would react. She said to me, ‘If they discover my situation, they will kill me,’” the psychiatrist said in the HRW report.
    

            Another doctor recounted the ordeal of a woman who said she had been raped by several RSF fighters.
    

            “When the woman found out she was pregnant, her husband expelled her and took away their children. She was left on the streets,” the doctor said.
    

            The woman came to the clinic seeking an abortion but the hospital director did not agree to the procedure, the doctor recalled. Another hospital could not perform the termination because it did not have an obstetrician.
    

            “After the pregnancy exceeded four months, we had to offer her psychological support so that she could accept the condition. It was the only option available to us,” the doctor added.
    

            The report said that “the physical, emotional, social and psychosocial scars left on survivors are immense.” Healthcare workers recalled treating survivors with “debilitating injuries they sustained due to the violence of the rapes and gang rapes, including vaginal bleeding, bruises and other physical trauma.” In at least four cases, these injuries proved fatal.
    

            Although the report mostly detailed violence committed by RSF forces, it said that some survivors had been scared to report incidents involving SAF soldiers, because they feared the authorities would dismiss their claims.
    

            It also criticized both sides for preventing a comprehensive response to gender-based violence. HRW said the SAF had willfully restricted humanitarian supplies and imposed a de facto blockade on drugs entering the RSF-controlled parts of Khartoum since late last year.
    

            The RSF has also pillaged medical supplies, according to the report, and some fighters “have on occasion perpetrated acts of sexual violence” against healthcare providers. One healthcare provider recalled being told not to report instances of sexual violence to the UN.

            “I can kill you right here right now if you want to, you should be careful and stop sending reports,” the fighter reportedly said.
    

            CNN has previously reported on the RSF’s campaign of killings, enslavement and sexual violence, conducted behind a curtain of secrecy. In earlier statements to CNN, the RSF has vehemently denied the allegations of rape and other atrocities.
    

            The report’s authors said the documented cases of sexual violence, forced marriage and deliberate attacks on healthcare facilities and providers constitute “a serious violation of international humanitarian law,” as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    

            Despite the severity of the suffering, HRW said there had been “little meaningful regional or international response.” It called on both sides immediately to stop attacks on healthcare facilities and workers and to allow aid to enter conflict zones.
    

            The report added that the UN Security Council should call on the warring parties to end sexual violence and impose targeted sanctions against the commanders and perpetrators responsible for the atrocities.

            “I see money on holidays like Monopoly money,” says Lisa Fraser.
    

            The currently unemployed 30-year-old has been to Taipei, Budapest and New York in the past year, with no plans of giving up vacations while she looks for a job.
    

            “I don’t have a budget. I’ll have a rough idea, but if I go over it, then I go over it. I won’t ever stop myself from having what I want on holiday.”
    

            According to a 2023 study from finance website WalletHub, 25% of Americans say it’s worth going into debt for a good vacation. The majority of those going into debt do so by charging travel expenses on a credit card, with 20% of respondents saying they would rather skip a credit card payment and put the money toward a vacation.
    

            Elizabeth Currid-Halkett is the author of The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class and a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. She believes that the current trend of travel moving from “optional” to “priority” began during the financial crisis in the 2000s and spiked after the pandemic.
    

            “We wouldn’t have been able to predict it, the way the pandemic affected different generations in different ways, but the idea that our friends matter, living life matters, how important living a good life is – that has led to a change in how people spend their money.
    

            “When you’re young, you don’t have money to shift into another area, but you can say, ‘I’ll think about this later and live my best life right now.’”
    

            Currid-Halkett brings up what she calls “the avocado toast thing.”

            She’s referring to a 2017 interview with Australian real estate mogul Tim Gurner, in which he appeared to imply that millennials couldn’t afford major purchases like down payments on homes because they were spending all their disposable income on avocado toast.
    

            Gurner’s comments went viral and were turned into multiple memes, many of which made the argument that home prices had gone so much while wages remained stagnant, which was the real reason young people couldn’t afford to buy houses – not their brunch orders.
    

            “Social mobility is so out of reach and something’s gotta give,” says Currid-Halkett. The mindset is “‘I can’t buy a house, I’m not sure I can afford college or grad school, so I might as well go to Spain and backpack. It’s barely a dent in the debt I’m going into for other things.’”
    

            Alex King, founder of personal finance website Generation Money, uses another word for this phenomenon: “doomspending.”
    

            “They do feel as if they’re owed something, and their generation has been treated unfairly,” he says. ”They think (credit card debt) is not as risky as it is. They don’t care so much about not getting into debt.”
    

            King adds that social media has changed the way many people think about travel. Digital nomads, influencers and content creators make it look like traveling full-time is accessible for everyone.
    

            Fraser agrees that FOMO plays a big role in her decision-making, as she hates feeling left out if her friends are going somewhere on vacation without her. She also makes an effort to visit shops, cafes and other spots she has seen online.

            While some people may simply put an expensive flight on a credit card and pay it off later, others may sign up for installment programs through third-party programs like Klarna, Uplift and Affirm.
    

            These “buy now, pay later” services are accepted by a range of airlines, including United, American and Delta, but King believes they can be predatory.
    

            “There’s people who get into debt recklessly, but they begin to manage it over time and their income begins to increase. If they’re a little bit stricter about how they control it, they can be fine. But there are a group of people who get into the habit of getting into debt. When it hits is when they start thinking about buying a home. It’s not just your income that counts – it’s your debts as well.”
    

            Fraser’s own financial experiences include a range of spending habits. In one case, she was moving out of an apartment and let the landlord keep her security deposit instead of paying for the coming month’s rent so she’d have cash in hand to spend on a trip with her friends. She has also been given money by her parents and charged items on a credit card in Hong Kong, which she stopped paying when she moved back to the UK.
    

            As for long-term plans, she still isn’t sure what will happen, although her goal is to return to Hong Kong, where she was living before being laid off from her English teaching job last year.
    

            “Eventually, if I’m going to get a house, I’ll get a house. I’ll make it work. I don’t want to say fate or anything like that, but if I’m meant to get a house, I know that I will get a house, so I just don’t stress about it.”

            Organizers of the Paris Olympics have apologized for what some critics described as a parody of “The Last Supper” during the lavish opening ceremony on Friday.
    

            The scene featured drag artists and dancers and was widely criticized by the Catholic church and Christian groups.
    

            The French Catholic Church said the festivities “included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.”
    

            “There was clearly never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,” Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps told a news conference on Sunday.
    

            “On the contrary, I think we tried to celebrate community, tolerance. We believe this ambition was achieved. If people have taken any offense, we’re of course really sorry.”
    

            While the scene has come under criticism, the opening ceremony was also widely praised, with some people pointing out that the scene was more reminiscent of other works, like “The Feast of the Gods” by Johann Rottenhammer and Jan Brueghel.
    

            Thomas Jolly, the director of the opening ceremony, insisted that “The Last Supper” – a mural painted by Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci – wasn’t the inspiration behind the scene in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV on Sunday.
    

            “Dionysus arrives at the table because he is the Greek God of celebration and that sequence is called ‘festivity,’” Jolly said.
    

            “The God of wine, which is also a French jewel and father of Sequana, the Goddess linked to the River Seine. The idea was to create a big pagan party in link with the God of Mount Olympus — and you will never find in me, or in my work, any desire of mocking anyone.”
    

            In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, the official Olympics account said the “interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings.”

CNN_25,What is the Golan Heights and who are the Druze?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/druze-golan-heights-israel-occupied-attack-explainer-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 18:58:00,world,"
            Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have reached new heights in the wake of a deadly rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
    

            The strike on Saturday hit a soccer field in the Arab town of Majdal Shams, home to a large Druze community, and killed at least 12 children, according to Israel.
    

            Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack and vowed to retaliate. The Iran-backed group denied being behind the strike.
    

            Here’s what to know about the Golan Heights, and the religious and ethnic Druze minority that fell victim to the attack.
    

            The Golan Heights is a strategic plateau that Israeli seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon.
    

            Syria’s capital Damascus is visible from atop the rocky Golan. The Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations.
    

            The Golan Heights is considered to be occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and Syria continues to demand it be returned.
    

            The area has often been a flashpoint, most recently in 2019 when former President Donald Trump said the US will recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights – a move that overturned years of policy and worsened tensions with Syria.
    

            Israel sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there.
    

            Saturday’s strike is not the first in the Golan Heights since Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza began following the October 7 attacks.
    

            In early July, a Hezbollah rocket attack killed two people in the region, prompting Israel’s head of the Golan Regional Council to call for retaliation “with force” against the Lebanese group. Hezbollah had said earlier that it fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Golan Heights “in response” to an alleged Israeli attack in Syria targeting a Hezbollah key member.
    

            The Druze are an Arab sect of roughly one million people who primarily live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.  Originating in Egypt in the 11th century, the group practices an offshoot of Islam which permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage.
    

            More than 20,000 Druze live in the Golan Heights. Most of them identify as Syrian and rejected an offer of Israeli citizenship when Israel seized the region in 1967. Those who refused were given Israeli residency cards but are not considered Israeli citizens.
    

            None of the Druze killed in Saturday’s attack on the soccer field held Israeli citizenship, the Regional Council of Majdal Shams told CNN.
    

            Druze of the Golan Heights share the territory with around 25,000 Jewish Israelis, spread across more than 30 settlements. Last year, the UN Human Rights Council sounded alarms over Israel’s plan to double the settler population on the Golan by 2027.
    

            Syrian Druze in the Golan have suffered from discriminatory policies, especially those relating to land and water allocation, according to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
    

            “Over the years, the expanding Israeli settlements and their activities had reduced the access of Syrian farmers to water, due to discriminatory policies related to prices and fees,” the UN committee said.
    

            Druze in the Golan Heights have historically opposed Israeli laws they saw as attempts at “Israelization.” In 2018, thousands of Druze-led protesters opposed the Jewish Nation-State Basic Law put forth by the Israeli parliament, fearing it would deepen discrimination.
    

            The law established Israel as the historic home of the Jewish people with a “united” Jerusalem as its capital and declared that the Jewish people “have an exclusive right to national self-determination” in Israel.
    

            Druze leaders at the time said the controversial law made them feel like second-class citizens because it didn’t mention equality or minority rights.
    

            Recent data reported in Israeli media shows an increase in the numbers of Druze from the Golan seeking Israeli citizenship, but the numbers doing so remain extremely small: 75 in 2017 to 239 in 2021
    

            Outside the Golan, some 130,000 Israeli Druze live in the Carmel and Galilee in Israel’s north.
    

            In contrast to other minority communities within Israel’s borders, many are fiercely patriotic. Druze men over 18 have been conscripted to the IDF since 1957 and often rise to positions of high rank, while many build careers in the police and security forces.

CNN_26,‘Too f***ing sexy.’ Female comedians are flipping the script on what they wear to perform,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/style/female-comedians-fashion-choices/index.html,2024-07-29 18:37:00,world,"
            Close your eyes and imagine a stand-up comedian. Perhaps they’re standing in a basement in front of an exposed brick wall. Or sitting on a wooden stool in the middle of a black curtained stage. What are they wearing? A shirt tucked into belted pants? A Rat-Pack-style suit and a loud tie? A graphic T-shirt and skinny jeans?
    

            Today, female comics are more likely to be seen in vintage Versace, Gucci or Alessandra Rich than a denim button-down. Last year, American comedian and host of the YouTube show “Baited,” Ziwe, conducted an explosive mock network interview with George Santos while wearing an archival 1980s red Jean Paul Gautlier skirt suit. Ayo Edibiri — best known for her role as Sydney on “The Bear” — began her career as a stand-up comic, although these days you’re more likely to see her sitting front row at Prada, Loewe or Thom Browne. Rachel Sennott, another former stand-up comic-turned-A24-actor, is an official Balenciaga ambassador; whereas Saturday Night Live mainstay Maya Rudolph has been donning in-the-know brands such as Khaite, Rodarte and Schiaparelli while promoting the second season of her show, “Loot.”
    

            Out on the stand-up circuit, some comedians are arriving on-stage dressed to the nines, stepping out in vintage luxury fashion and statement shoes. Earlier this year, New York-based comic Mary Beth Barone released her first independent special, “Thought Provoking,” on YouTube. To the uninitiated, Barone wore a sparkly silver dress. To those interested in fashion, it was a piece of history. The archival Versace chainmail slip dress was previously worn by Kate Moss on the arm of Naomi Campbell at a London charity gala in 1999. According to Moss, she “walked straight off the Versace runway” to the event.
    

            While promoting her show on Instagram, Barone nodded to this strange collision of worlds in the caption: “When the brilliant designers at Versace made this dress for Kate Moss in 1999, I do not think they imagined it would be worn 25 years later by a standup comedian!” Barone then appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in a Fall-Winter 2003 Gucci little black dress, designed by Tom Ford during his tenure as creative director — a niche period in Gucci’s history revered by only the most in-the-know fashionistas.
    

            “I love fashion, first and foremost,” Barone told CNN during a video call from her apartment in New York. “It was the culture I grew up with; Britney Spears, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Paris Hilton, all these people that were so influential.” Barone’s feminine, runway-ready wardrobe often stands in stark contrast to her deadpan punchline delivery, two disparate threads coming together to create an intriguing stage presence. She proudly attributes herself to the “pop star generation,” inspired not just by the off-duty fashion of these early noughties celebrities, but their commitment to clothes as part of their act — elevating a show’s production value. “Those pop stars were so powerful and willing to own their aesthetic and their persona as performers. I just felt like at a certain point, why can’t comedians do that?”
    

        “He was like, ‘Your jokes are great, but you’re just dressed too f*cking sexy.”
    

            Mary Beth Barone
        

            Cat Cohen, whose first Netflix comedy special “The Twist…? She’s Gorgeous” aired in 2022, is similarly keen to rebrand comedy attire into something more glittery and fun. “I always just thought, ‘Well, I’m going to treat myself like a pop star and see what happens,’” she told CNN in a video interview. On-stage, Cohen is all feathers and rhinestones — rarely seen without a sweep of electric blue eyeshadow. Her foolproof formula is a loud mini-dress and tall boots, the more iridescent the better. It helps that most of Cohen’s performance looks are custom made by an actual pop star designer, Kelsely Randall, whose client list includes Beyoncé, Lizzo, Lorde and Chloe and Halle Bailey. “If I have a TV appearance, or for example my next special, as soon as we have a ballpark of when we’re shooting, I reach out to Kelsey.”
    

            Flamboyant female comedians aren’t new. Phyllis Diller, Jean Carroll and Joan Rivers were often dishing out zingers on club stages while wearing elbow gloves and pearls. (Rivers was even the inspiration behind the expertly dressed comic Midge Maisel, star of the Golden-Globe winning TV series “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”) But their ilk was slowly replaced with a homogenous muddle of blazers and business casual attire.
    

            “For a long time, female comedians were pressured into dressing like their male counterparts,” said Barone. “When I started taking improv, there was a manual you would buy and read alongside classes. In it, it said you should never wear shorts or dresses on stage because if the audience can see your legs it’s distracting and it will take away from the comedy.” Barone remembers after one particular set, she was followed outside by the booker. “He was like, ‘Your jokes are great, but you’re just dressed too f***ing sexy.”

            Cohen, too, felt an expectation that, in her early years, influenced what she wore. “When I first started I felt more shy,” she said, “and I was more hesitant to lead into my persona. I remember once wearing overalls and a T-shirt to a show. Like no, babe. That was not me.”
    

            Margaret Cho — named one of Rolling Stone’s top 50 comedians of all time — has long flown the flag for fashion, performing on-stage in the 1990s in Betsy Johnson, Todd Oldham and Gemma Kong; despite rising to fame during one of the industry’s most chauvinistic eras. The comedic landscape of the 1980s and ‘90s was ruled by men such as Andrew Dice Clay (whose vulgar nursery rhymes got him banned from MTV in 1989) and Louis C.K., who was accused of sexual misconduct by five women in 2017. Given that women were so often the butt of the joke, any sign of weakness — including an outlandish outfit — could undermine a performance. “You had to approach ‘attractiveness’ in a certain way, you didn’t want to go into hyper-feminine mode,” Cho said in a video call from LA. “Because then it would automatically negate what you were saying. It was hard to get people to trust you as a comedian if you were ‘attractive.’ There was such a culture of misogyny.”
    

            But Cho still relished the act of dressing up, partly in defiance of the male dominated environment she was working within. “I remember there was a TV show where we couldn’t afford a new outfit. So Karen Kilgarriff and Janeane Garofalo and I all bought one dress,” she said. “The three of us chipped in, and wore it differently.” The frock in question — from fast fashion brand Contempo Casuals, Cho remembers — was a boxy, hammered silver mini-dress. “I think it was a knock-off of one of Kim Gordon’s designs for X-Girl. I wore mine without tights, Janeane wore a long (undershirt) and I think Karen belted hers.”
    

            As the world’s of comedy and couture inch ever-closer, perhaps one day a stand-up set will become as lucrative for fashion brands as a Harry Styles world tour. (During his last series of gigs in 2022, which according to Forbes earnt Styles $617.3 million, the artist almost exclusively wore Gucci.) “It’s just like rock and roll,” Cho said. “You want your rock star to be fully aware of their style. The brand of a comedian, that really includes style.” She already feels optimistic about Ayo Edebiri, Rachel Sennott and the comedic invasion of luxury fashion houses. “(Sennott and Edebiri) are so perfect for bringing in new energy to these old houses. It’s a twist on the ingénue, like let’s actually use a comedian. It’s really special. ”

            Cohen agrees. “Before, people maybe felt like (dressing) wasn’t crucial to what they were doing artistically. But now, I think it only adds to what I do.” Barone — who has recently been seen wearing Y/Project and archival Dior — will have no doubt packed a treasure trove of vintage pieces for her the US leg of her new tour, “Pillow Talk” this August. “I don’t want it to seem like I’m saying I’m the first person to ever wear a dress to do stand up comedy,” she said. “But it feels like there’s a shift happening. And I’m excited about it.”

            The 2024 presidential election is now 99 days away following a historic month of political shake-ups that upended the race. Vice President Kamala Harris is seeing a rise in favorability ratings with polls showing multiple paths to victory. Trump responded to Harris’ momentum with a series of personal attacks over the weekend: he referred to her as “evil,” mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that “the American dream is dead” if Harris wins in November. The vice president pushed back on her opponent’s “wild lies” and goaded him about debating her. Trump’s selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate has also shaped the race and Democrats are now closely watching Harris’ vetting process for her own vice presidential nominee in the coming days or weeks.
    

            The Park Fire, the seventh-largest wildfire in California history, has scorched more than 360,000 acres — an area larger than the city of Phoenix. It has destroyed over 100 structures and threatens thousands more, according to CalFire. The blaze was 12% contained as of early today but evacuation warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. The weather forecast for the Northwest calls for lighter winds than the area has seen in recent days, giving firefighters some optimism about slowing the progress of the blaze. In Oregon, the Durkee Fire is the largest wildfire burning in the state, at more than 288,000 acres. It has injured three people and destroyed four residences. Local authorities say the fire is 49% contained.
    

            Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah after blaming the Lebanese militant group for a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The strike killed 12 children who had been playing on a soccer field, further escalating tensions in the region. Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes rocked Gaza during another weekend of heavy bombardment. A group of US doctors who volunteered in hospitals across Gaza also sent an open letter to the White House sharing their experiences and demanding an immediate ceasefire.
    

            A strict abortion law is set to take effect in Iowa today, preventing most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. That’s roughly when a fetal heartbeat can be detected, or possibly before many women know they are pregnant. The law passed last year, but a judge had blocked it from being enforced. Iowa is among nearly two dozen states that have banned or limited access to abortion procedures since the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to the procedure nationwide.

CNN_28,Exclusive: Inside the Supreme Court’s negotiations and compromise on Idaho’s abortion ban,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-emtala-biskupic/index.html,2024-07-29 20:32:00,politics,"
            The Supreme Court began the year poised to build on its 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and to deliver a new blow to abortion access.
    

            In January, the court took the extraordinary step of letting Idaho enforce its ban on abortion with an exception only to prevent the death of a pregnant woman, despite an ongoing challenge from the Biden administration arguing that it intruded on federal protections for emergency room care.

Biden to call for major Supreme Court reforms, including term limits, at Civil Rights Act event Monday


            No recorded vote was made public, but CNN has learned the split was 6-3, with all six Republican-nominated conservatives backing Idaho, over objections from the three Democratic-appointed liberals.
    

            But over the next six months, sources told CNN, a combination of misgivings among key conservatives and rare leverage on the part of liberal justices changed the course of the case.
    

            The first twist came soon after oral arguments in late April, when the justices voted in private on the merits of the conflict between Idaho and the Biden administration. There suddenly was no clear majority to support Idaho, sources said. In fact, there was no clear majority for any resolution.
    

            As a result, Chief Justice John Roberts opted against assigning the court’s opinion to anyone, breaking the usual protocol for cases after oral arguments.
    

            That move would have marked a startling turn of events for any dispute, but it was particularly surprising here because the court had already given Idaho the advantage by granting its appeal before a hearing on the merits of the case could be held in a US appellate court.
    

            Instead, a series of negotiations led to an eventual compromise decision limiting the Idaho law and temporarily forestalling further limits on abortion access from the high court. The final late-June decision would depart from this year’s pattern of conservative dominance.

Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan. Takeaways from her wide-ranging comments.


            This exclusive series on the Supreme Court is based on CNN sources inside and outside the court with knowledge of the deliberations.
    

            After the court in June 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, more than a dozen states like Idaho began outright banning abortion. The Idaho law had exemptions only to prevent death of the pregnant woman and in instances of rape or incest. Other states instituted new restrictions on the procedure.
    

            The Biden administration, supporting reproductive rights, tried to immediately counteract some effect of the Supreme Court’s decision. It issued formal guidance saying the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires stabilizing treatment regardless of a patient’s ability to pay, would preempt any state abortion ban in situations when an emergency termination was needed.
    

            In August 2022, the Justice Department sued Idaho, seeking an order that would block the state from enforcing its ban in emergency rooms when it conflicts with EMTALA. Idaho lost in an initial proceeding in a US district court, as a judge issued a temporary injunction against the abortion ban. While an appeal was pending, Idaho sought the high court’s intervention.
    

            The impact of the justices’ January order allowing Idaho’s ban to take effect was urgent and immediate. The state’s largest provider of emergency services increasingly had to airlift pregnant women experiencing complications out of state.
    

            As the weeks passed and Idaho and the federal government began formally making their case in filings before scheduled April oral arguments, the situation for pregnant women in medical emergencies – risking organ failure, the loss of fertility and permanent disability – became more evident.
    

            So did defects in some of Idaho’s claims. Its lawyers argued that EMTALA would require hospitals to terminate a pregnancy if a woman’s mental health (rather than physical condition) required it and would force individual doctors to perform abortions despite conscience objections – two contentions US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said were groundless.
    

            Idaho’s built-in lead began to slip, particularly against the larger national backdrop over agitation for reproductive rights and the politically charged presidential election season.
    

            The court had given Idaho the advantage in January by granting its request for an early hearing. Such expedited review is allowed only when, according to Supreme Court procedure, “the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice.”
    
Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren tells CNN’s Jake Tapper that the Supreme Court has “jumped the guardrails” and is “actively undermining our democracy.”

Warren: ‘The Supreme Court is on the ballot’ in November


            During the April 24 hearing, signs that the conservative bloc was splintering emerged.
    

            Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who had earlier voted to let the Idaho ban be enforced, challenged the state lawyer’s assertions regarding the ban’s effect on complications that threatened a woman’s reproductive health. She said she was “shocked” that he hedged on whether certain grave complications could be addressed in an emergency room situation.
    

            Barrett’s concerns echoed, to some extent, those of the three liberals, all women, who had pointed up the dilemma for pregnant women and their physicians.
    

            Doctors in Idaho had told the court that if they complied with federal emergency-care law and helped a pregnant woman in peril, they would be risking criminal conviction. Alternatively, if they transferred patients needing stabilizing care out of state, they risked seriously delaying medical attention and could exacerbate the harm.
    

            Judging from the public arguments alone, there appeared a chance the court’s four women might vote against Idaho, and the five remaining conservatives, all men, in favor of the state and its abortion prohibition.
    

            But at the justices’ private vote two days later, Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh shattered any split along gender lines. They expressed an openness to ending the case without resolving it.
    

            They worked with Barrett on a draft opinion that would dismiss the case as “improvidently granted.”
    

            Barrett had come to believe the case should not have been heard before lower court judges had resolved what she perceived to be discrepancies over when physicians could perform emergency abortions, even if a threat to the woman’s life was not imminent.
    

            She would eventually deem acceptance of the case a “miscalculation” and suggest she had been persuaded by Idaho’s arguments that its emergency rooms would become “federal abortion enclaves governed not by state law, but by physician judgment, as enforced by the United States’s mandate to perform abortions on demand.” She believed that claim was undercut by the US government’s renouncing of abortions for mental health and asserting that doctors who have conscience objections were exempted.
    

            In essence, Barrett, along with Roberts and Kavanaugh, were acknowledging they had erred in the original action favoring Idaho, something the court is usually loath to admit. They attributed it to a misunderstanding of the dueling parties’ claims – a misunderstanding not shared by the other six justices, who remained firm about which side should win.
    

            During a wide-ranging talk at a legal conference in Sacramento on Thursday, liberal Justice Elena Kagan said the court may have learned “a good lesson” from the Idaho case: “And that may be … for us to sort of say as to some of these emergency petitions, ‘No, too soon, too early. Let the process play out.’”
    

            During internal debate from the end of April through June, the court’s three other conservative justices – Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch believed the facts on the ground were clear and that Idaho’s position should still prevail. They said the 1986 EMTALA did not require hospitals to perform any abortions and could not displace the state’s ban.
    
Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren tells CNN’s Jake Tapper that the Supreme Court has “jumped the guardrails” and is “actively undermining our democracy.”

            Alito, who had authored the 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturning Roe, was adamant that the text of EMTALA required the opposite of what the Biden administration was advocating. He said the law compels Medicare-funded hospitals to treat, not abort, an “unborn child.”
    

            With Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch unchanged in their opposition to the proposed off-ramp, Barrett, Roberts and Kavanaugh needed at least two other votes for a majority to dismiss the case.
    

            Two of the liberals, Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan, were ready to negotiate, but with caveats. They disagreed with Barrett’s rendition of factual discrepancies and – more crucially – they wanted the court to lift its prior order allowing the ban to take effect while litigation was underway.
    

            This was one case in which liberals, usually holding a weak hand because of their sheer number against the conservative super-majority, had greater bargaining power because of the fracture between the Barrett-Roberts-Kavanaugh bloc and the Alito-Thomas-Gorsuch camp. Debate persisted for weeks over whether the order allowing the ban to be fully enforced should be lifted.
    

            The eventual compromise in Moyle v. United States brought together a bare majority: Barrett, Roberts and Kavanaugh, from the right, and Kagan and Sotomayor, from the left. They agreed that the case would be dismissed and the January order revoked. That meant Idaho would not be able to enforce its ban in emergency situations for the time being.  (Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the third liberal on the court, agreed that the order should be lifted but refused to vote for dismissal.)
    

            When the court “stays” an injunction, as the justices had for Idaho, the premise is a litigant would suffer “irreparable harm” if the court failed to act. As Barrett, Roberts and Kavanaugh acquiesced, agreeing with Kagan and Sotomayor, to lift the stay, Barrett wrote, “the injunction will not stop Idaho from enforcing its law in the vast majority of circumstances.”
    

            Alito quarreled with that conclusion and the presumption that the state no longer faced irreparable harm.
    

            “It is very likely that the preliminary injunction will lead to more abortions, including in at least some cases where the fetus is viable,” he wrote, adding. “Apparently, the Court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents. That is regrettable.”

            Overall, the decision gave liberals and the Biden administration a rare win. In Idaho, it preserved some abortion access. But the question of whether federal law supersedes state law will inevitably return, either from US appellate court action in the Idaho matter, or from emerging clashes in other states.
    

            Jackson’s arguments against dismissal were the opposite of those on the far-right. She said physicians and their patients needed a straightforward answer now, not in a few years. She believed the state’s law must yield to EMTALA’s dictate of medically necessary treatment, including abortions in limited situations, to stabilize patients.
    

            “Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,” Jackson insisted when the case was announced on June 27. She took the rare step of reading portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench. She said pregnant women with their health in peril, along with their doctors, remain “in the dark” about which law dominates.
    

            But as much as Jackson protested that the court dodged the case, she implicitly acknowledged the leanings of conservatives who agreed to the dismissal and what the outcome might have been if they decided the merits.
    

            “As of today,” she wrote, “the Court has not adopted Idaho’s farfetched theories – but it has not rejected them either.”

CNN_29,A half-million records and one app: The group behind a massive effort to ‘clean’ voter rolls,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/voter-rolls-ballot-challenges-true-the-vote-elections/index.html,2024-07-29 20:19:00,politics,"
            Police officers in Texas, senior citizens at a nursing home in Pennsylvania and people who had registered to vote at a Marine base in California.
    

            They are among the thousands of voters whose right to cast a ballot has been needlessly challenged ahead of this November’s election by activists — many of whom have been inspired by conspiracy theories — seeking to prevent voter fraud.
    

            “My simple right as a voter is being attacked,” said Daniel Moss, a university administrator from Denton County, Texas, whose registration was challenged by one of the activists even though he has lived in the county and voted there for about two decades. “It’s kind of un-American to do that.”
    

            Election officials across the country have been inundated with dubious complaints about inaccurate voter rolls, which have wasted government resources and sapped taxpayer money spent reviewing lists of registered voters that officials say are already carefully maintained, a CNN investigation has found.
    

            One of the main drivers of the fruitless challenges is a conservative Texas-based nonprofit group called True the Vote, an election-monitoring organization that has long peddled debunked voter-fraud theories. The group’s founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, has called on followers to help clean voter rolls by using an app called IV3 that enables users to research voter data and submit voter-eligibility challenges to local election offices.
    

            The activists say they are merely trying to help clean voter rolls to prevent fraud, but their challenges have been riddled with errors and have at times included vulnerable groups, such as people registered to vote at assisted-living facilities and homeless shelters, documents obtained by CNN show.
    

            True the Vote has said that nearly 7,000 people have been using its app, which references voter and postal data, to challenge a total of more than a half-million records.
    

            County and state officials across nine states — many of them considered battlegrounds — interviewed by CNN said they have meticulous processes for maintaining voter rolls. They also said they cannot simply purge registered voters from the rolls without making efforts to contact them and following other safeguards. Some officials added that portions of the data in the IV3 app appear outdated, which they say undercuts much of the activists’ work.
    

            “These people are actually trying to help but they did not understand the procedures we have in place,” said Matt Webber, the registrar of voters for Yavapai County, Arizona, who explained how two people who said they were working with True the Vote in May and June sought to challenge a list of potentially ineligible voters that the county had already addressed by contacting them and, if warranted, placing them into an inactive status.
    

            Some election observers have argued that even if the activists submitting mass challenges are operating in good faith, their efforts waste election officials’ time, promote false notions about the maintenance of voter rolls and could prompt the inappropriate removal of some registered voters. In Waterford, Michigan, for example, an activist’s lobbying last year led to what the state called the improper removal of 1,000 people, including an Air Force officer’s registration that was later reinstated, as reported by The New York Times.
    

            Moreover, some argue the challenges show how certain groups have not only spread false election conspiracy theories but also convinced believers to act on them, which could further inflame distrust in elections.
    

            “A lot of these people are people of goodwill. They have just been fed a constant diet of lies,” said David Becker, founder of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, who added that one of the “great ironies” is that “the voter lists are more accurate than they have ever been” because of modern data-sharing technology.
    

            In a statement, Engelbrecht of True the Vote said her group seeks to “empower citizens to ensure accurate, secure, and fair elections,” and argued, “In pursuit of our mission, True the Vote has developed specialized processes, technologies, and methodologies that have been affirmed by experts and courts across the political spectrum.” She did not name the experts and courts to which her statement referred.
    

            Some states have recommended local officials disregard or dismiss pleas from private citizens to drop groups of voters from the rolls. A June memo from Pennsylvania’s deputy secretary for elections and commissions warned that such challenges can lead to “unlawful disenfranchisement.” A spokesperson for California’s secretary of state told CNN that responding to unvetted voter-removal requests “distracts” from necessary election preparation. The challenges come as a wave of states have passed laws with added voting restrictions since 2020.
    

            Other officials have been more receptive.
    

            “We are open to anyone assisting,” said Jeff Roberts, the administrator of elections for Tennessee’s Davidson County, home to Nashville. Roberts said he has received voter-registration challenges from a local resident who separately told CNN he had spent about 100 hours compiling lists of voters who appeared ineligible based on data in the IV3 app. Roberts said he would follow the law and would not simply purge voters from the rolls without giving them the opportunity to respond.
    

            About a dozen people in Denton County, Texas — outside of Dallas — have submitted what has sometimes surpassed 1,000 challenges a day, according to the county elections administrator, Frank Phillips. Records show at least some of them have used IV3.Phillips said he has sought to review all their challenges but added the effort has become “a little time-consuming.”
    

            Phillips said most of the challenges involve voters the county has already placed in an inactive status or removed from the rolls, whereas a minority of them warrant follow-up. In those cases, he said the activists’ challenges speed up the process the county already has for maintaining its rolls and verifying voters’ residences.
    

            Some of the challenges submitted by Denton County activists have had blatant problems. For example, one woman challenged a few local police officers who lawfully listed their address as a government building, emails show.
    

            “These people just can’t see past the end of their own nose, evidently,” said one of those officers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he lacked approval to speak to the media. He explained that cops and other officials are sometimes allowed to use alias addresses like county buildings out of concern for their personal safety. “They’re just throwing everything against the wall to see what will stick. … That undermines their investigation.”
    

            True the Vote has seemingly encouraged the practice of submitting mass challenges against people registered at unconventional addresses even if some voters may be properly registered at those locations.
    

            In a June webinar, for example, True the Vote’s founder Engelbrecht highlighted what she called a “sketchy” address in Phoenix where she said hundreds of people were registered to vote. “Would I challenge them? Probably so,” she said.
    

            A basic internet search reveals a local nonprofit organization has offered that location as a mailing address for homeless people seeking shelter or other services. Still, a few weeks after that True the Vote webinar, a woman tried to challenge the individuals registered there. A county official responded to her email by thanking her but stated the county already “continuously” performs list maintenance through processes mandated by law.
    

            Challenges submitted by another woman in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, included voters registered at assisted living facilities and nursing homes, according to the local elections director, Marybeth Kuznik. In a June letter, Kuznik explained that she would reject the woman’s challenges because they conflicted with voter registration laws and because the mere appearance that someone lives in a “commercial” facility like an assisted living facility does not justify cancellation.
    

            Melanie Patterson, the Fayette County woman who submitted those challenges after doing research with IV3, told CNN that she wanted to help clean the rolls to deter potential fraud in future elections. Despite an absence of evidence, she said she believes voter fraud in Pennsylvania influenced the 2020 election.
    

            “Dirty voter rolls mean dirty elections,” Patterson said. “If you don’t protect that vote, we are going to lose the foundations this country was built on.”
    

            Patterson’s views were largely reflected by a handful of other IV3 users who agreed to speak to CNN.
    

            Christine Wilfong of Maricopa County, Arizona, said she believes her county has not effectively policed its voter rolls and that she hoped her efforts would remind officials that local citizens are now providing more government oversight.
    

            “We are watching you,” Wilfong said, referring to election officials. “That’s why I’m doing what small thing I can do to try to clean up the rolls. … I do want people to understand that they are being looked at.”
    

            Aside from using the IV3 app promoted by True the Vote, Wilfong and others referenced the film “2000 Mules” — which cited data from True the Vote and purported to reveal widespread ballot fraud in the 2020 election — for bolstering their desire to help prevent potential voter fraud.
    

            But that film has been discredited. When a Georgia judge ordered True the Vote last year to provide relevant evidence and sourcing for its claims, the group responded that it did not have the identity or contact information for its sources, nor records that supported other claims made.
    

            The film’s publisher, Salem Media Group, issued a public apology this year and said it would stop distributing the movie after a Georgia man wrongly accused of voter fraud sued the company for defamation. In its statement, the company pointed the finger at True the Vote and a conservative filmmaker, saying it relied on their representations and evidence that people were captured illegally depositing ballots.
    

            The history of True the Vote and its leaders peddling baseless election conspiracy theories extends further.
    

            In November 2016, days after Donald Trump won the presidential election, a then-board member of True the Vote, Gregg Phillips, tweeted that he had verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens. When pressed in an appearance on CNN in January 2017, Phillips refused to provide the evidence. Instead, he argued that he needed more time to prepare a public report to ensure accuracy and because the work — much like the efforts of IV3 today — was being completed by volunteers.
    

            Despite those controversies, the group’s revenue has ballooned over the last decade. True the Vote pulled in just over $4 million between 2014 and 2019 but reported nearly $12 million in revenue between 2020 and 2022, the latest year of its publicly available financial reports.
    

            True the Vote has also faced allegations of financial wrongdoing. Last year, the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability filed a complaint with the IRS that alleged True the Vote may have excessively paid former director Phillips’ business and improperly loaned money to Engelbrecht.
    

            Specifically, the organization paid Phillips’ business at least $750,000 for data analysis after the 2020 election and did not disclose the transactions in a government filing, according to the complaint. True the Vote also allegedly issued loans to Engelbrecht, a director and employee for the organization, despite Texas law prohibiting nonprofit directors from receiving loans from their groups. A True the Vote spokesperson previously argued that the complaint was filed as a “form of harassment” and that it was “without merit.”
    

            An IRS spokesperson said the agency by law cannot confirm or deny whether an entity is under examination.
    

            Today, True the Vote continues to solicit donations with appeals to “protecting the republic” and calls on followers to help “save” trustworthy elections.
    

            But to some election professionals and voters who have had their registrations challenged, the group’s efforts could have the opposite effect.
    

            “These kinds of rash activities can do much more harm than good,” said Moss, the Denton County, Texas voter. “If you want to be part of the solution and you want to help … maybe push to get people to vote versus trying to find answers that don’t even have problems to begin with.”

            Alma Johnson Powell, the wife of the late Secretary of State Colin Powell, has died. She was 86.
    

            Her death was confirmed by the former diplomat’s chief of staff and family spokesperson, Peggy Cifrino.
    

            The Powells were married for nearly 60 years, and Alma was by her husband’s side during his remarkable and historic military career. The two met on a blind date in 1961 shortly before he was deployed to Vietnam as a military adviser, and he later rose to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff beginning under President Ronald Reagan and secretary of state during George W. Bush’s administration.
    

            Four months after the Powells were married, he was sent to Vietnam, leaving Alma to navigate the first few years of her life as a newlywed alone, which she later called “the defining experience of my life.”
    

            “Part of who I am is because of my career as a military wife. I think of the military as family,” Alma Powell once said. “During the course of our young lives, he was often away. … So, like many military spouses today, you’re essentially a single parent. Your job was to make a home wherever you were. Home was where we were as a family, wherever that was.”
    

            At the time of her passing, Powell was listed as chair emeritus of America’s Promise Alliance, a nonprofit founded by her husband that seeks to help at-risk youths by coordinating the efforts of a “cross-sector association of community organizations, businesses, and government organizations,” according to the National Museum of African American History & Culture.
    

            She also served on the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, was on President Barack Obama’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities from 2010 to 2012 and was the advisor to the Red Cross of the military district of Washington during her husband’s tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, according to a biography of Alma Powell on the website of America’s Promise Alliance.
    

            Alma Powell “is survived by her three children, Michael, Linda, and Annemarie and their families, her niece and two nephews, and countless beloved extended family members and friends,” Cifrino said in a statement.

CNN_31,What to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyond,https://edition.cnn.com/politics/election-2024-key-dates-dg/index.html,2024-07-29 20:07:00,politics,"
A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            Far from the boring rematch that had many Americans tuning out politics, the 2024 presidential election has had wild twists and scary turns.
    

            Nobody expected President Joe Biden’s campaign to implode in less than a month, from the shock of his performance at CNN’s debate in late June to his decision to step aside in the race in late July. Democrats went from literally freaking out about his candidacy to a new excitement about Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.
    

            Nobody expected an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, an event that unified Republicans around him and has many in his party showing a sort of divine reverence for his near-death experience.
    

            So we don’t know specifically what will happen in the sprint to Election Day on November 5, or what could come after, when the country’s unique Electoral College process gets going. But we do have some idea of what to expect:
    

            While the Democratic Party almost immediately rallied around Harris as its nominee, it still needs to officially select her. Delegates will do that in short order, between August 1 and August 7, before the convention, a backstop maneuver to ward against ballot changes.
    

            Harris will also need to pick a running mate. Look for that to occur soon, according to CNN’s Jeff Zeleny, and not right before the convention, as frequently occurs.
    

            In late August, Democrats will convene in Chicago for their convention. Expect the most incredible reception for Biden. Democrats have pivoted from worrying over his election prospects to lionizing him as a hero.
    

            Earlier in the month, Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, turns 40. He’d be the third-youngest vice president in US history and the first millennial in nationwide elected office if the Republican ticket wins. With Biden out of the race, Vance is on the ticket with the oldest major-party nominee in history with Trump, a baby boomer.
    

            Biden and Trump had agreed to a second debate, hosted by ABC News, to occur on September 10. But with Biden out of the race, Trump has suggested he might not take part in a debate sponsored by ABC. Instead, the Trump campaign suggested a debate on Fox News, and that network has suggested September 17.
    

            Both sides seem eager to debate, so look for details to emerge.
    

            The first early voting will also get underway in September. North Carolina is the first state to send mail-in ballots, on September 6, but other states will follow suit in the weeks after.
    

            Back in school and back to work, many Americans may start to pay more attention to the election in September. There will also be some touchstone moments in the cultural zeitgeist, such as when “Saturday Night Live” premiers at the end of the month and everyone will find out if Maya Rudolph will return as Harris – and we find out who will play Vance.
    

            Trump also faces sentencing for his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. That September 18 date could slip as the court reacts to new immunity granted to presidents by the Supreme Court.

            Election Day isn’t until November 5, but most states allow some kind of early voting, either by mail or in person, and that process will kick into overdrive in October.
    

            Most Americans, nearly 70%, voted early or by mail in 2020, according to census figures, although that figure was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
    

            The campaigns will be focused on getting out the vote in the few key battleground states they think are up for grabs. In 2020, Biden won five states that Trump won in 2016. Those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – could again be the focus in 2024 when Harris, who turns 60 in October, takes on Trump.
    

            US law requires federal elections to take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that’s November 5.
    

            People who don’t vote early will hit their local voting location. Polls will close at different times around the country. Due to the rise of voting by mail, if key states are close, like they were in 2020, we probably won’t know the winner on Election Day.
    

            Regardless, expect lawsuits in certain states and the potential for recounts in others. Election Day is far from the end of the election.
    

            Toward the end of November, Biden turns 82.
    

            After questions about the election are settled, states confirm, or ascertain, their statewide results. Electors gather in their respective state capitols to cast electoral votes for their statewide winner.
    

            Nebraska and Maine also allocate some electoral votes by congressional district, and these could be pivotal in a close race.
    

            The new Congress takes the oath of office on January 3. It’s this new Congress that, in the unlikely event of an Electoral College tie, would settle the election. Each state would get one vote for president in the House of Representatives.
    

            In any event, lawmakers gather on January 6, as everyone should remember from 2020, to count electoral votes. Harris will preside. She could either be the fifth vice president in history to oversee her own Electoral College victory, or the fourth in history to oversee her own Electoral College defeat.
    

            On January 20, 2025, the next president takes the oath of office.

CNN_32,Americans keep turning their backs on McDonald’s,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/investing/mcdonalds-earnings/index.html,2024-07-29 20:54:00,us,"
            Inflation has caught up with McDonald’s, and budget-conscious Americans are looking elsewhere for their fast-food fix. But McDonald’s believes it has a solution: Value meals.
    

            McDonald’s on Monday reported that sales at US stores open at least a year fell 0.7% last quarter from the same period a year earlier, dragged down by fewer customers going to the fast-food company’s restaurants. McDonald’s isn’t alone: Starbucks, Burger King, Wendy’s and other rivals are also reporting less foot traffic and lower overall sales as consumers pull back their spending on food away from home.
    

            The tough environment for McDonald’s wasn’t limited to the United States: Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 1% globally. It’s the first time sales fell by that measure since the last quarter of 2020.
    

            Several factors were operating against McDonald’s this past quarter, including a tough comparison to last year. In the same quarter a year ago, McDonald’s got a 10.3% sales boost, mostly attributed to its viral Grimace shake — a purple, sugar-loaded drink in honor of Grimace’s “birthday.” The shake became a sensation after TikTok users posted videos of themselves pretending to die after drinking the shake.
    

            But McDonald’s also has said for the past several quarters that some customers — particularly low-wage earners — are revolting against what many see as bad value.
    

            “Beginning last year we warned of a more discriminating consumer, particularly among lower income households — and as this year progressed, those pressures have deepened and broadened,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski on a conference call with investors Monday morning.

            So the company at its March investor day unveiled its new strategic plan, dubbed “Accelerating the Arches,” to lure back price-conscious customers. The plan focuses on value meal plans like the popular $5 meal introduced earlier this summer.
    

            Those meals, which have shown early signs of popularity, hadn’t fully taken effect until recent weeks and weren’t fully baked into last quarter’s results. The $5 meal deal sales have exceeded expectations, the company said Monday. But Kempczinski said on the call that the company has more work to do, noting, “It’s clear that our value leadership gap has recently shrunk.”
    

            “We are confident that ‘Accelerating the Arches’ is the right playbook for our business and as consumers are more discriminating with their spend, we are focused on the outstanding execution of delivering reliable, everyday value and accelerating strategic growth drivers like chicken and loyalty,” said Kempczinski in a statement.
    

            Kempczinski also said McDonald’s will continue to innovate and change as customer demands shift. He pointed to McDonald’s new emphasis on chicken, which is now on par with beef sales at restaurants. And the company is testing out a new burger, called the Big Arch, which features two patties, cheese, crispy topping and tangy sauce.
    

            “The hallmark of a great company is its ability to perform in good times and in bad, and we are resolved to reignite share growth in all our major markets regardless of the prevailing market conditions,” Kempczinski said on the investor call. “This won’t happen overnight. But it’ll happen.”
    

            For the first couple years of America’s inflation crisis, restaurants and food companies like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola said consumers were responding well to constant price increases and were willing to shell out more for their favorite meals, snacks and treats. But the tide began to turn last year. McDonald’s then reported what has become a trend for the restaurant and its competitors: Customers saying no to higher prices.

            Food prices have continued to rise over the past year, but most of that increase has come from food away from home — that is, restaurants and fast-food locations — rather than the grocery store. That means dining out has become something of a luxury for some Americans.
    

            McDonald’s in particular, has been the focus of some consumers’ ire. A viral social media post last year showing an $18 Big Mac meal set off an online backlash to what many customers believed was corporate greed making inflation worse for everyday Americans. It turned out to be a single rest stop in Connecticut that had posted that price, which is double the national average. McDonald’s president has since apologized — and urged franchisees not to go rogue anymore.
    

            Whether or not that viral post was the final straw for McDonald’s customers, Americans have been punishing the company ever since. Sales have been sinking, and the company’s profit margin, once rising steadily in the post-pandemic years, has fallen back to where it was pre-Covid. The company on Monday said prices keep rising, but as it absorbs some of that additional cost, McDonald’s will continue to look for ways to grow its profit — even as customers demand more value.
    

            McDonald’s (MCD) stock, which rose less than 1% in premarket trading Monday, has fallen 15% this year, missing out on a larger market rally.

CNN_33,South Africa’s ANC kicks former president Jacob Zuma out of party he once led,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/africa/jacob-zuma-expelled-from-anc-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 20:54:00,world,"
            South Africa’s former President Jacob Zuma has been expelled from the African National Congress (ANC), the party he once led.
    

            “Former President Jacob Zuma has actively impugned the integrity of the ANC,” ANC Secretary General Comrade Fikile Mbalula outlined at a press briefing on Monday.
    

            “This conduct is irreconcilable with the spirit of organization discipline and letter of the ANC constitution,” Mbalula said, adding that former President Zuma has been running on a dangerous platform that casts doubts on our entire constitutional edifice,”

Opinion: The other former president who used Trump’s playbook – and lost


            The expulsion comes after the ANC announced it had suspended Zuma’s membership on January 29 this year, following Zuma’s declaration of support for a newly formed rival political party, uMkhonto WeSizwe Party (MK party), in December 2023.
    

            In January, the ANC stated that the party is dedicated to nurturing and, when required, correcting its members and leaders.
    

            However, as their renewal efforts intensify, individuals like Zuma, whose actions conflict with the party’s values and principles, will find themselves excluded from the ANC.
    

            Mbalula said Zuma has 21 days to appeal the decision.
    

            Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals and internal infighting in the ANC. He was found guilty of contempt of court by the constitutional court for his refusal to testify to an anti-corruption commission.
    

            In May, the same court ruled unanimously that Zuma was not eligible to run for parliament in the country’s critical general election, capping months of long speculation and legal wrangling on whether the former leader of the ruling ANC would be able to stand for the country’s top legislative body.
    

            Yet, while he was barred from running in this May’s general election, his face remained on the ballot paper for the MK party.
    

            The ANC lost its majority for the first time in 30 years in that election, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019.
    

            The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), received 21.8% of the vote. While Zuma’s MK had nearly 14.59% of the vote.

CNN_34,Text messages from law enforcement show concerns were raised more than 90 minutes before Trump rally shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/trump-assassination-attempt-police-shooter-presence/index.html,2024-07-29 21:25:00,politics,"
            Text messages between law enforcement before the assassination attempt against Donald Trump earlier this month suggest that some officers raised the shooter’s presence at the rally more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof and fired eight rounds at the former president.
    

            In text messages obtained by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley from the Beaver County Emergency Unit, a local countersniper first raised with his colleagues that he saw someone park near their vehicles and sit on a nearby picnic table at 4:26 p.m.
    

            According to the messages, which were first reported by The New York Times, local law enforcement later took a picture of the same man, who turned out to be the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, and sent it to other officers in a group chat nearly 30 minutes before Crooks would shoot at Trump at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.

            “Kid learning around building we are in,” one texts reads. “I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS [Secret Service] snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.”
    

            Questions remain over how local law enforcement failed, after spotting Crooks previously, to stop the shooter from climbing up the side of a nearby building and coming so close to killing a former president and current Republican nominee. It’s also unclear how the Secret Service designated security that day and who managed the communication between local and federal law enforcement.
    

            Members of the Beaver County SWAT team, which assisted in security, said in an interview with ABC News that they were supposed to have a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service when the agents arrived in Butler but that no such meeting took place.
    

            “We were supposed to get a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service members whenever they arrived, and that never happened,” Jason Woods, a sniper on the team, told ABC News.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment.
    

            It’s also unclear, based on congressional testimony and reporting, what time local law enforcement told the Secret Service directly about Crooks and sent the pictures one of their members took of the soon-to-be shooter before he accessed the roof.
    

            In the wake of the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, acting Director Ronald Rowe, along with FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, will testify before two Senate committees Tuesday about the assassination attempt, as lawmakers hope to get more answers around the failures that day.

            A citizen of Montenegro nicknamed the “pirate of the unknown” has been extradited to New York City from Italy to face charges connected to what US authorities called an international drug ring that transported tons of cocaine around the world.
    

            Milos Radonjic, 34, arrived in Brooklyn on Friday and is scheduled to be arraigned in federal court Monday, according to federal prosecutors and officials with the Department of Homeland Security and FBI. A federal grand jury indicted him and several other people last year on charges of conspiracy and attempt to violate the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act.
    

            According to court filings, Radonjic was a high-ranking member of a transnational drug organization that used commercial cargo ships, including some registered to deliver goods to the US, to transport tons of cocaine from South America to Europe for drug cartels in the Balkans. Ship crew members knowingly took part in the alleged trafficking, court documents say.
    

            US authorities said Radonjic and others arranged to use speed boats to deliver drugs at night to cargo ships on the high seas near Colombia and Ecuador.
    

            Radonjic and others also trafficked narcotics that have “contributed to the overdose and drug addiction crisis in the United States and throughout the world,” US prosecutors wrote in a request to a federal judge to detain Radonjic pending trial.
    

            “This arrest and successful extradition is a lesson that the high seas are not a no-man’s land for the rule of law, and that we are committed to bringing those who violate it to justice,” Breon Peace, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement Saturday.
    

            Peace’s office said Radonjic had not been assigned an attorney as of Saturday.
    

            Radonjic was arrested in October after traveling to Italy to captain a yacht in an international race, authorities said.
    

            US authorities have not released the names of other people who were indicted and said they were not in US custody.

            At least eight people were stabbed in the northern English town of Southport on Monday, with some of the victims being transferred to a children’s hospital, ambulance officials said.
    

            Merseyside Police said it received reports of a stabbing and emergency services were called to a “major incident” in the town at around 11:50 a.m. local time (6:50aET).
    

            “There are a number of reported casualties and more details will be confirmed when possible. Armed police have detained a male and seized a knife. He has been taken to a police station,” police said in their latest statement. “Please avoid the area while we deal with this incident. There is no wider threat to the public.”
    

            Local business owner Colin Parry, who was one of the people who called the police, said the incident in Southport was like a “scene in a horror movie,” according to PA Media.

            “The mothers are coming here now and screaming. It is like a scene from a horror movie,” Parry said, adding that, “police have got him.”
    

            “It’s like something from America, not like sunny Southport,” Parry said.
    

            The Alder Hey Children’s Hospital Trust in Liverpool, about 20 miles from Southport, declared a “major incident.”“The Trust is working with other emergency services to respond to this incident and our Emergency Department is currently extremely busy,” the hospital said in a statement posted to its website. “We ask parents to only bring their children to the Emergency Department if it is urgent,” it said.

CNN_37,Museums closed Native American exhibits 6 months ago. Tribes are still waiting to get items back,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/style/museums-closed-native-american-exhibits/index.html,2024-07-29 21:49:00,world,"
            Tucked within the expansive Native American halls of the American Museum of Natural History is a diminutive wooden doll that holds a sacred place among the tribes whose territories once included Manhattan.
    

            For more than six months now, the ceremonial Ohtas, or Doll Being, has been hidden from view after the museum and others nationally took dramatic steps to board up or paper over exhibits in response to new federal rules requiring institutions to return sacred or culturally significant items to tribes — or at least to obtain consent to display or study them.
    

            The doll, also called Nahneetis, is just one of some 1,800 items museum officials say they’re reviewing as they work to comply with the requirements while also eyeing a broader overhaul of the more than half-century-old exhibits.
    

            But some tribal leaders remain skeptical, saying museums have not acted swiftly enough. The new rules, after all, were prompted by years of complaints from tribes that hundreds of thousands of items that should have been returned under the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 still remain in museum custody.
    

            “If things move slowly, then address that,” said Joe Baker, a Manhattan resident and member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians, descendants of the Lenape peoples European traders encountered more than 400 years ago. “The collections, they’re part of our story, part of our family. We need them home. We need them close.”
    

            Sean Decatur, the New York museum’s president, promised tribes will hear from officials soon. He said staff these past few months have been reexamining the displayed objects in order to begin contacting tribal communities.
    

            The museum also plans to open a small exhibit in the fall incorporating Native American voices and explaining the history of the closed halls, why changes are being made and what the future holds, he said.
    

            Museum officials envision a total overhaul of the closed Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains halls — akin to the five-year, $19 million renovation of its Northwest Coast Hall, completed in 2022 in close collaboration with tribes, Decatur added.
    

            “The ultimate aim is to make sure we’re getting the stories right,” he said.
    

            Lance Gumbs, vice chairman of the Shinnecock Indian Nation, a federally recognized tribe in New York’s Hamptons, said he worries about the loss of representation of local tribes in public institutions, with exhibit closures likely stretching into years.
    

            The American Museum of Natural History, he noted, is one of New York’s major tourism draws and also a mainstay for generations of area students learning about the region’s tribes.
    

            He suggests museums use replicas made by Native peoples so that sensitive cultural items aren’t physically on display.
    

            “I don’t think tribes want to have our history written out of museums,” Gumbs said. “There’s got to be a better way than using artifacts that literally were stolen out of grave sites.”
    

            Gordon Yellowman, who heads the department of language and culture for the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said museums should look to create more digital and virtual exhibits.
    

            He said the tribes, in Oklahoma, will be seeking from the New York museum a sketchbook by the Cheyenne warrior Little Finger Nail that contains his drawings and illustrations from battle.
    

            The book, which is in storage and not on display, was plucked from his body after he and other tribe members were killed by US soldiers in Nebraska in 1879.
    

            “These drawings weren’t just made because they were beautiful,” Yellowman said. “They were made to show the actual history of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people.”
    

            Institutions elsewhere are taking other approaches.
    

            In Chicago, the Field Museum has established a Center for Repatriation after covering up several cases in its halls dedicated to ancient America and the peoples of the coastal Northwest and Arctic.
    

            The museum has also since returned four items back to tribes, with another three pending, through efforts that were underway before the new regulations, according to spokesperson Bridgette Russell.
    

            At the Cleveland Museum in Ohio, a case displaying artifacts from the Tlingit people in Alaska has been reopened after their leadership gave consent, according to Todd Mesek, the museum’s spokesperson. But two other displays remain covered up, with one containing funerary objects from the ancient Southwest to be redone with a different topic and materials.
    

            And at Harvard, the Peabody Museum’s North American Indian hall reopened in February after about 15% of its roughly 350 items were removed from displays, university spokesperson Nicole Rura said.
    

            Chuck Hoskin, chief of the Cherokee Nation, said he believes many institutions now understand they can no longer treat Indigenous items as “museum curiosities” from “peoples that no longer exist.”
    

            The leader of the tribe in Oklahoma said he visited the Peabody this year after the university reached out about returning hair clippings collected in the early 1930s from hundreds of Indigenous children, including Cherokees, forced to assimilate in the notorious Indian boarding schools.
    

            “The fact that we’re in a position to sit down with Harvard and have a really meaningful conversation, that’s progress for the country,” he said.
    

            As for Baker, he wants the Ohtas returned to its tribe. He said the ceremonial doll should never have been on display, especially arranged as it was among wooden bowls, spoons and other everyday items.
    

            Museum officials say discussions with tribal representatives began in 2021 and will continue, even though the doll technically does not fall under federal regulations because it’s associated with a tribe outside the US, the Munsee-Delaware Nation in Ontario.
    

            “It has a spirit. It’s a living being,” Baker said. “So if you think about it being hung on a wall all these years in a static case, suffocating for lack of air, it’s just horrific, really.”

CNN_38,Tom Daley ‘happiest I’ve been’ as novel approach with Noah Williams produces Olympic silver,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/sport/tom-daley-paris-olympics-diving-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 21:45:00,world,"
            Days before taking part in the Paris Olympics, Tom Daley already felt like he had won a gold medal, such was his joy at having his kids at the competition with him.
    

            On Monday, the British diver got his hands on an actual medal, too, winning silver alongside partner Noah Williams in the men’s synchronized 10-meter platform. That marked the fourth medal of Daley’s long Olympic career, dating all the way back to the Beijing Games in 2008 when he competed as a fresh-faced 14-year-old.
    

            “It’s the happiest I’ve been in diving in all these years because diving wasn’t necessarily my top priority,” he told reporters. “Of course, it is extremely important, but there is nothing more important than my children and being able to spend time with them.”
    

            Daley and Williams, who only started diving together in June last year, produced an excellent performance to score 463.44 at Paris’ Aquatics Center to finish behind a near-flawless display from the Chinese duo of Lian Junjie and Yang Hao. Canada’s Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray, meanwhile, won a tight battle over Mexico and Ukraine for third.
    

            The silver medal adds to the gold and two bronzes that Daley already owns, but the 30-year-old has many titles besides Olympic medal winner. He’s a dad, a father and a voice for the LGBTQ+ community, drying himself with a rainbow-striped towel at the side of the pool in Paris.
    

            In recent years, he’s added knitting aficionado to that list, with an Instagram page showcasing his creations boasting 1.2 million followers.
    

            It looked like Daley’s diving days would be behind him when he stepped away from the sport after the Tokyo Olympics, and just 15 months ago, he was enjoying his new life in Los Angeles with his husband, Oscar-winning writer Dustin Lance Black, and their two children, Robbie and Phoenix.
    

            An injury to Matty Lee, Daley’s gold medal partner in Tokyo, created the opportunity to partner with Williams, but even then their training time was limited, with Daley living in LA and Williams in London.
    

            “We only ever trained at the competitions,” Daley explained. “So we would turn up and wing it together and compete.”
    

            Aside from that, Daley would train at UCLA while balancing child care and time with his family. The unusual approach proved successful in Paris as the duo produced their biggest individual score at an international event, headlined by high scores on their fourth and sixth dives.
    

            “I feel like that might be our strength, that we don’t need to do as much synchro together,” said Daley. “I think that our tactic this time was maybe to focus more on the individual dives because, with the good individual dives, you get the good execution.
    

            “I think our fourth dive today was the best in terms of timing and synchronization. That was one that we’ve been working on a lot.”
    

            The silver medal capped off a memorable few days for Daley in the French capital having also been chosen as one of Great Britain’s flag bearers at the opening ceremony, alongside rower Helen Glover.
    

            The question now, having been the youngest and oldest member of the British Olympic diving team, is whether Daley will extend his career by another four years, and the 2028 Games, of course, will be held on his doorstep in LA.
    

            But Daley wants that to be a consideration for another day. “Right now, I’m going to enjoy this moment,” he said. “We’ll see how it goes on.”

            Victim interviews are a routine part of criminal investigations, but are voluntary.
    

            Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, told reporters on a conference call Monday that investigators have focused their efforts on uncovering the motive of the 20-year-old would-be assassin.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was “highly intelligent” and had a growing interest in shooting, Rojek said. While officials had already revealed that Crooks searched “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy” before the shooting, Rojek said Monday that he also made searches related to “power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices and the attempted assassination of the Slovakian Prime Minister earlier this year.”
    

            His primary social circle “appears to be limited to his immediate family, as we believe, he had few friends and acquaintances throughout his life,” Rojek said.
    

            “While the FBI investigation may not yet have determined a motive, we believe the subject made significant efforts to conceal his activities,” Rojek said. “Additionally, we believe his actions also show careful planning ahead of the campaign rally.”
    

            Crooks also used aliases to make firearms-related purchases online.
    

            “Starting in the spring of 2023, the subject made more than 25 different firearms related purchases from online firearms vendor using an alias,” Rojek said.
    

            In the first half of 2024, Crooks also made “six chemical precursor-related purchases online of materials used to create the explosive devices recovered in the subject’s vehicle and home,” Rojek said.
    

            “For those purchases he used aliases,” Rojek added.

Wildfires are raging out of control in the Western United States and Canada – destroying homes, forcing evacuations and injuring residents. One inferno has reportedly destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah. Another has scorched more than 360,000 acres of California – an area larger than the city of Phoenix. Here’s the latest:


            • Borel Fire ravages historic mining community: The fire in Kern County, California, “swept through the community of Havilah and Piute Meadows Ranches,” CalFire said. Havilah was discovered in 1864 and for more than 20 years served as an active mining center, according to California State Parks. The Borel Fire had burned more than 50,000 acres and had zero containment as of Sunday night.

It was 12% contained as of Monday morning but evacuations warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. Lower winds from the south could help take pressure off the fire’s eastern edge. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official.
    

            • Arson suspect to be arraigned Monday: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the Park Fire. The man is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, spreading flames that caused the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.

Wildfire danger for the southern areas of the province remain very high to extreme, according to Melissa Story, spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. “This area did not see the moisture as the other areas of the province did,” Story said.

            The number of homes and businesses destroyed in Havilah – population 250 – is still being assessed, fire officials said at a weekend news conference. But evacuation orders have been in effect, according to Jim Snow, one of the incident commanders.
    

            Fueled in part by red-flag conditions – such as warm temperatures, very low humidities and strong winds – the Borel Fire has exploded in growth. It scorched 30,000 acres in a 24-hour period, Snow said.
    

            Despite 1,200 personnel assigned to the inferno, the blaze was 0% contained as of Sunday.
    

            “Some of those edges of the fire, with rapid growth, we’re having to chase down rather than stand in front of it,” Snow said. “We have had some light injuries on the incident – a lot of heat-related injuries.”
    

            Cloud and smoke coverage allowed firefighters to increase containment lines around the Park Fire Saturday, but the challenges returned on Sunday, CalFire Incident Commander Billy See said.
    

            While some areas were downgraded from evacuation orders to warnings, spot fires prevented officials from lifting or changing more orders and warnings, officials said.
    

            “We are working really hard to get people back into their house as soon as possible,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea.

            Conditions have not been favorable for crews, Yuba City Fire Department spokesperson and firefighter Jeremy Hollingshead told CNN.
    

            “It was a wind-driven fire, it was a topography-driven fire, fuel-driven fire, everything was stacked against us,” Hollingshead said. “At that point in time, we threw everything we had at it, but again, we’re not going to put anybody at the head of this thing. What we had to do was put crews in the high-risk areas, where structures could possibly burn and do the best work they can there.”
    

            He added firefighters took advantage of more favorable conditions to try and get a better handle on the blaze.
    

            “Firefighters right now, from the sky to the ground, they’re taking advantage of the break we do have in the weather, so hopefully in the next few days we can mitigate a lot of that threat,” Hollingshead said.
    

            Chico, California, the largest city in Butte County where the Park Fire is ongoing, will see temperatures in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday, a significant drop from the triple digit temperatures of last week. Winds continue to decrease for the Park Fire area as well, with sustained winds below 10 mph Monday, and as low as 5 mph by Tuesday.
    

            There is even a weak storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest, expected to bring some shower chances. This amount of rainfall is helpful as it doesn’t lead to as great of flash flooding risk for burn scars.
    

            The massive Park Fire, believed to be the result of arson, forced thousands to flee their homes after igniting Wednesday near Chico, California, consuming thousands of acres per hour, burning dozens of structures and leaving behind graveyards of burned trees and cars.
    

            Retired Chico firefighter John Maretti told CNN he has lost his house in the Park Fire despite preparing as best he knew how.
    

            “I bought a bulldozer. We cleared things out. We made sure that we had a Class A roof and non-flammable walls. We did a lot. We had sprinklers. We had hoses. I mean, I’m a firefighter. I set this up for maximum opportunity for the house to make it and it did not, Maretti said. “There’s just no way that anybody could have survived with this house.”
    

            Despite the destruction of his property, Maretti said he felt fortunate the household – including two dogs and a cat – had escaped unharmed – something he credited, in part, to breaking his ankle last Monday.
    

            “I felt very capable staying. And I have hoses, I have all sorts of equipment, but with a broken ankle, there’s just no choice. I had to leave. And fortunately, because I had the broken ankle, I probably saved my life, because I probably would have stayed and tried to fight it, which would have been the wrong decision,” he said.
    

            Maretti said the speed at which the fire had spread wasn’t what he was used to.
    

            “So this was just a lot faster fire than I’d ever seen,” Maretti said. “This is just an angry fire, and completely different than anything I’ve ever seen before.”
    

            A Tehama County resident described to CNN affiliate KOVR fleeing the Park Fire on the only exit road out of their neighborhood – which the blaze had already jumped.
    

            “When we saw the fire coming over the ridge, which it did, it was coming at us. We thought that was bad. And then we put everything in the car and took off,” Jim Young told KOVR.
    

            “We get on the highway and it is burning on both sides for 10 miles. It was like driving through an inferno,” Young said.
    

            The Park Fire is burning in Butte County, where California’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            Bruce Hey and his brother-in-law Christopher Apel told KOVR that the blaze had forced them to evacuate their adjoining properties in the Cohasset area.
    

            “We had a lot of people who were staying there from the Camp Fire and … and everything is burning,” Apel told KOVR.
    

            Hey said that he drove through the blaze to safety, but burned his arm in the process.
    

            “I tried to outrun it,” he said. “I wouldn’t have gotten burned if I hadn’t rolled down the window to look in the rearview mirror. I was right in the middle of it and I was trying to put it in reverse.”
    

            Jasper, a popular tourist town in the middle of Alberta’s Jasper National Park, has seen widespread destruction due to the wildfire there, which has scorched just under 90,000 acres.
    

            The park remains closed and more than 17,000 people are still under evacuation orders, Jose Tilney, deputy managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday afternoon.
    

            Almost 40% of all structures in the city have been destroyed by the Jasper Wildlife Complex fire, data released Saturday by the Municipality of Jasper show.
    

            Of the 1,113 structures in the town, 410 were reported to be destroyed, and 10 sustained visible damage, the Jasper Rapid Visual Damage Assessment said.
    

            The fire remains “out-of-control and is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather,” Parks Canada said.

            Following the US Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, nearly two dozen US states have banned or limited access to the procedure. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity.
    

            The fight over abortion is well underway in state legislatures and courts. Most recently, the Iowa Supreme Court upheld a six-week abortion ban passed by the state legislature last year. The ban is expected to go into effect on July 29, replacing the previous 22-week limit.
    

            The Supreme Court ruled to allow emergency abortions in Idaho for now and unanimously rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to regulating mifepristone, the first of two drugs used in medication abortion. The abortion pill will continue to be available to patients via mail, without an in-person doctor’s visit.
    

            CNN is tracking these legal challenges as they make their way through the courts. Here’s where abortion access currently stands in the United States.

CNN_42,The ‘blue man’ at this year’s opening ceremony defends memorable Olympic moment,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/sport/blue-man-olympics-opening-ceremony-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-29 22:54:00,world,"
            It was one of the more memorable moments of arguably the most unique opening ceremony in history, but one that has sparked controversy around the world.
    

            The scene in question has been described by some critics as a parody of “The Last Supper” and one which featured drag artists and multiple dancers.
    

            The performance and scene in question also included Philippe Katerine, a French entertainer who featured as the Greek god of wine Dionysus and quickly became known as the “semi-naked blue guy.”
    

            In the scene, Katerine sang a song while lying on a table, seemingly without clothes and covered head-to-toe in glittery blue paint.
    

            His appearance went viral on social media, watched by millions of people around the world. In an interview with CNN, Katerine said his song “Nue” – or “Naked” – was a message for peace, inspired by war, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine.
    

            “Would there have been wars if we’d stayed naked? The answer is perhaps not because you can’t hide a gun or a dagger when you’re naked,” he said.
    

            “So you’ve got this idea of harmlessness when it comes to the naked man. And the idea of the origins of the Olympic Games in Greece, which are represented today because when you see paintings, they’re of naked athletes too, also with the idea that they can’t carry weapons when they’re naked.
    

            “This was also the idea behind the origins of the Olympic Games. So there I came, simply, to sing this song.”
    

            Olympic organizers have since apologized for the scene after it was criticized by the Catholic church and Christian groups.
    

            The French Catholic Church said the festivities “included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity.”
    

            Paris 2024 spokesperson Anne Descamps later said there was “clearly never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,” while the director of the opening ceremony, Thomas Jolly, insisted that “The Last Supper” – a mural painted by Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci – wasn’t the inspiration behind the scene.
    

            Katerine said he was “deeply sorry” if his appearance shocked people but confirmed it was never his intention and the fallout has been driven by a “misunderstanding.”
    

            “I was brought up as a Christian and the best thing about Christianity is forgiveness. For me, it’s the most beautiful thing there is: forgiveness,” he added.

            “So I ask for forgiveness if I have offended anyone, and the Christians of the world will grant me that, I’m sure, and will understand that it was mostly a misunderstanding. Because when it comes down to it, it wasn’t about representing ‘the Last Supper’ at all.”
    

            Katerine quickly became aware of criticism and said he re-watched his performance to work out why people would be upset.
    

            “I saw something very colorful, reconciliatory and peaceful,” he said, adding he was left “surprised.”
    

            The singer said it was the first time he had sung the song and was frustrated the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had refused to use subtitles, leading in part, he says, to the confusion that followed.
    

            Despite receiving criticism from some, Katerine was also praised for creating one of the lasting memories from the lavish ceremony.
    

            He said it took three make-up artists three hours to create his glittery blue look. His image also required a full-body wax – dedication indeed.
    

            “On stage, I’m always very, very happy to perform and show off, within the limits of reason, of course,” he said.
    

            “But in life, I’m very shy and like to hide and observe others without being seen. That’s what I prefer. So it’s true that it amuses me to see myself like this, but there you have it.”

CNN_43,FBI to ask for Trump’s ‘perspective’ in shooting probe witness interview,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/trump-shooting-fbi-details/index.html,2024-07-29 23:34:00,politics,"
            Donald Trump has agreed to sit for a victim interview with the FBI, which is investigating this month’s attempted assassination, an agency official said Monday.
    

            Victim interviews are a routine part of criminal investigations, but are voluntary.
    

            “The interview of the former president will be consistent with any other victim interview that we do,” Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, told reporters on a conference call Monday. The FBI wants to “get his perspective on what he observed, just like any other witness to the crime.”
    

            “It is a standard victim interview, like we would do for any other victim of crime under any other circumstances,” Rojek said.

Minute-by-minute: Visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt


            FBI investigators continue to focus their efforts on uncovering the motive of the 20-year-old would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks.
    

            Crooks was “highly intelligent” and had a growing interest in shooting, Rojek said. While officials had already revealed that he searched “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy” before the shooting, Rojek said Monday that he also made searches related to “power plants, mass shooting events, information on improvised explosive devices and the attempted assassination of the Slovakian Prime Minister earlier this year.”
    

            His primary social circle “appears to be limited to his immediate family, as we believe, he had few friends and acquaintances throughout his life,” Rojek said.
    

            “While the FBI investigation may not yet have determined a motive, we believe the subject made significant efforts to conceal his activities,” Rojek said. “Additionally, we believe his actions also show careful planning ahead of the campaign rally.”
    

            Crooks also used aliases to make firearms-related purchases online.
    

            “Starting in the spring of 2023, the subject made more than 25 different firearms related purchases from online firearms vendor using an alias,” Rojek said.
    

            In the first half of 2024, Crooks also made “six chemical precursor-related purchases online of materials used to create the explosive devices recovered in the subject’s vehicle and home,” Rojek said.
    

            “For those purchases he used aliases,” Rojek added.
    

            Crooks used foreign-based encrypted email accounts to purchase firearm components, chemicals and other explosive components, investigators said Monday.
    

            Bobby Wells, assistant director of the Counterterrorism Division at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, said that the bureau had trouble initially gaining access to the accounts because of their encryptions. But since they accessed the accounts, investigators found that the shooter was using the emails primarily to make online purchases.
    

            “We also identified some additional accounts and identifying information, including aliases he was using on these encrypted platforms,” Wells said.
    

            While Crooks had explosive components in his home and purchased chemical precursors previously, investigators said his parents didn’t have clear reasons to report on their son prior to the shooting.
    

            “As far as what was in the home, the chemicals and explosive-related materials,” Rojek said, “it’s our understanding from the parents and others that the shooter had a long interest in science and things like this, doing experiments and things like this over a period of time.”
    

            He added that because of that, his parents “weren’t concerned” that the materials could have been “focused on committing an attack of this nature or harming other people.”
    

            “He wasn’t hoarding ammunition” or doing things that would raise clear red flags for his parents, Rojek said, adding that they have been “extremely cooperative” with the FBI.
    

            Describing Crooks’ isolation from others, Rojek highlighted his lack of friends both online and in person.
    

            “Even in his gaming chatrooms, we see very little interaction” with others, Rojek said, adding that it was unusual to see such a lack of activity there. “To date, we have not found anyone that is really close in any type of social circle.”

CNN_44,1 injured after flash flooding hits Dollywood theme park,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/dollywood-theme-park-flooding/index.html,2024-07-29 23:03:00,us,"
            Dolly Parton’s theme park was a bucket list item for Zoe Ballesteros. So when the California resident started planning a trip to Philadelphia to see Arsenal play this week, she added a stop in Tennessee to check Dollywood off her list.
    

            But instead of soaking up the energy, amusement park food, rides and shows the famous country singer’s theme park and resort has to offer, Ballesteros’ short-lived, two-hour visit ended with her soaked in murky floodwaters from a torrential downpour mother nature instead decided to deliver Sunday evening to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where Dollywood is located.
    

            A flash flood warning had been issued at 5:39 p.m. for central Sevier County in east Tennessee, which includes Pigeon Forge, according to the National Weather Service. At the time of the alert, “Between 1.5 and 2.5 inches” of rain had fallen in the previous hour. When the warning was extended at 9:33 p.m., the weather service said between 4 and 5 inches had fallen in the Pigeon Forge area. A local road at the park’s entrance collapsed as a result of the rain, Pigeon Forge Police said.

            Dollywood patrons fled the park as brown floodwaters gushed throughout the walkways and spilled into the parking lot where social media images show patrons helping each other wade through knee-deep water, some carrying small children in an effort to return to their vehicles – which in some cases were also submerged in high waters.
    

            Among those fleeing the park were Sarah Myers and her family of six. Myers, who lives 45 minutes from the park, grew up going to Dollywood as a young child. The family members are season pass holders and have been to the park while it has rained before but Myers said Sunday’s rainstorm “was definitely different” in nature.
    

            “It went from being, oh, this is a funny, ironic situation to this is a scary situation,” Myers recalled as her husband carried their 6-year-old in his arms while she lugged a stroller and her 8-, 12- and 14-year-old slowly walked through the floodwaters to their van.
    

            “At one point, my husband said he felt like we were competing in the Oregon Trail because it was just like ‘who’s gonna make it out alive,’” Myers said.
    

            One minor injury was reported, according to a Dollywood park statement from Sunday night. Dollywood could not confirm specific details of the injury, Wes Ramey, Dollywood’s public relations director, told CNN by email Monday.
    

            “Dollywood is supporting guests whose vehicles were affected by this weather event, and cleanup crews have been deployed,” the statement said.

            Despite the park’s effort to keep patrons informed on social media, some guests expressed frustration on X, complaining more wasn’t done to help attendees reach safety.
    

            Ballesteros and two family members bought tickets at 5:18 p.m., she said, while the parking lot was already beginning to flood but she wasn’t aware of the situation inside the park until she got inside.
    

            “Once we got into the actual park, it was only a few hundred yards before we saw the murky water rushing down,” she said. “There were a handful of shops and the Dolly Experience that were open, but no rides or shows.”
    

            “Most employees said they’d never seen anything like it,” Ballesteros said, who plans to return at a later date and is hopeful she’ll be refunded almost $300 she spent on tickets.
    

            Dollywood policy is to offer rain checks and refunds to guests if they request either, Ramey said.
    

            The park plans to open at noon on Monday, its regularly scheduled time, it said.

            An ancient Christian monastery in Gaza has been added to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the ongoing conflict in the region.
    

            The move, taken in New Delhi by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which oversees the preservation of sites of historical importance and value around the world, was prompted by fears about how Israel’s military campaign might affect the archaeological remains.
    

            The Monastery of St. Hilarion, known locally as Tell Umm Amer, was simultaneously added to the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, according to an announcement by UNESCO on its website on Friday.
    

            “This decision recognizes both the site’s value and the need to protect it from danger,” the organization explained online.

            The remains are located on coastal dunes and in olive groves some six miles south of Gaza City. They span more than four centuries, from the late Roman Empire of the fourth century CE to the Umayyad period (661-750 CE), according to conservation nonprofit the World Monuments Fund.
    

            The monastery was founded by St. Hilarion and was home to the first monastic community in the Holy Land, according to UNESCO.
    

            Its location on the border of Africa and Asia put it on a trade route that meant the monastery prospered during the Byzantine period. It was also at the center of religious and cultural exchanges between the two continents.

            “Characterized by five successive churches, bath and sanctuary complexes, geometric mosaics, and an expansive crypt, this Christian monastery was one of the largest in the Middle East,” the World Monuments Fund said on its website.
    

            But it was abandoned after an earthquake in the seventh century and was only uncovered by local archaeologists in 1999.
    

            UNESCO stated: “In view of the threats to this heritage site posed by the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, the World Heritage Committee used the emergency inscription procedure provided for in the World Heritage Convention.
    

            “In accordance with the terms of the Convention, its 195 States Parties are committed to avoid taking any deliberate measures likely to cause direct or indirect damage to this site, which is now inscribed on the World Heritage List, and to assist in its protection.”
    

            The organization explained that inclusion on the danger list automatically opened the door to technical and financial help for the site, and if necessary, help with restoring it.

CNN_46,Olympic moment of the day: The love story between Rafael Nadal and Paris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/sport/rafael-nadal-paris-olympic-moment-of-the-day-spt/index.html,2024-07-29 23:35:00,world,"
            It’s a love affair that began almost 20 years ago and the passion clearly hasn’t fizzled out at all.
    

            Paris and Rafael Nadal are a match made in heaven. And for a brief spell in the second set of the Olympic men’s singles tennis tournament’s most anticipated match between the Spaniard and his longtime rival Novak Djokovic, it seemed like it might be enough to spur the 14-time French Open champion to a comeback that seemed impossible just minutes before.
    

            What started out as the most highly-anticipated match of these Olympics quickly threatened to turn into a snoozer. Djokovic wildly outplayed Nadal in the opening set and the beginning of the second, looking unstoppable with a 6-1 first set and going up 4-0 in the second.
    

            The roars from Court Philippe-Chatrier in support of Nadal winners and the chants of “Rafa! Rafa!” had gone from a roar to a plea. Sweat poured from the King of Clay’s brow in between games and he looked no match for the Serb’s power and speed.
    

            But when Nadal took the fifth game of the second set, time seemed to suddenly roll back.
    

            When Djokovic sent the ball into the net, the crowd cheered. Djokovic double faulted in the next game to give Nadal a break point, the crowd roared. And as Nadal took the next two games, Roland Garros exploded in unison as it tried one more time to carry its favorite champion.
    

            “I always feel like playing at home when I play here,” Nadal said afterward. “It’s so special for me. I enjoyed the fans, and they gave me the advantage at the moment that things started to change a little bit, so I can’t thank enough all the people here who, you know, made me feel so special.”
    

            It’s a relationship developed over the years and covered in glory. Nadal’s performances on the red Parisian clay are the stuff of legend and he dominated the French Open like no other man in history.
    

            Over those 19 years of playing at this famous stadium, a relationship has been built between the Spaniard and the Paris crowds who pack the stands. On Monday, Djokovic was cheered.
    

            But Nadal? He was loved.
    

            “This, for me, is amazing to have and to have the feeling that I feel very, very well supported and loved. It’s the most important place of my career,” the 22-time grand slam champion said.
    

            In the end, it wasn’t enough. Djokovic took the final two games of the second set and continued his quest in search of his first gold medal: the one honor his extraordinary career lacks.
    

Nadal will still be playing in the Paris Games, teaming with fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles competition.
    

            The Spanish legend is reluctant to say that he’s done playing at Roland Garros or playing against Djokovic. When asked about retirement after the match, he seemed frustrated with the question.
    

            “Every day? Every day you want me to retire, every day, guys,” Nadal said.
    

            “You know, I am trying to do my best every single day, you know? … I cannot live every single day with the feeling that it’s going to be or not going to be my last match,” Nadal said.
    

            “I come here, I try my best, I play my best, and when I decide to stop playing or when I decide to keep going, I will let you know. I don’t know, I just try my best every single day trying to enjoy a thing that I have been enjoying for so much time.
    

            “I have been suffering a lot of injuries the last two years, so if I feel that I am not competitive enough to keep going or physically I’m not enough ready to keep going, I will stop and I will let you know, you know?”
    

            A prolonged standing ovation for the Spaniard marked his exit from the court on Monday. It certainly seems that Paris isn’t ready for its romance with Nadal to fade away just yet.

CNN_47,Biden administration announces new $1.7 billion lethal aid package for Ukraine,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/ukraine-lethal-aid-package-us/index.html,2024-07-30 00:33:00,politics,"
            The Biden administration announced on Monday a new lethal aid package for Ukraine totaling about $1.7 billion and largely consisting of missiles and ammunition for missile, artillery and air defense systems the US has previously provided to Ukraine.
    

            The US is committing $1.5 billion in new weapons and equipment to Ukraine through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which will include “capabilities to augment Ukraine’s air defenses, fires, and anti-tank weapons, as well as funding to sustain equipment previously committed by the United States,” according to a Defense Department news release.
    

            The Defense Department is also sending Ukraine up to $200 million worth of weapons and equipment directly from US Department of Defense stockpiles via Presidential Drawdown Authority, which includes “air defense interceptors; munitions for rocket systems and artillery; and anti-tank weapons,” according to the news release.
    

            The administration says this is their 20th “USAI package and sixty-second tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine and since August 2021,” according to the release.
    

            The USAI package includes missiles for Ukraine’s National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), a key air defense platform.
    

            It also includes ammunition for Ukraine’s High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a weapons platform that Ukraine has recently been using to strike effectively in Russian territory.
    

            The package also includes artillery ammunition, one of Ukraine’s top requests.

CNN_48,Dollywood patrons wade through knee-deep water as theme park floods,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/dollywood-theme-park-flooding/index.html,2024-07-30 00:11:00,us,"
            Dolly Parton’s theme park was a bucket list item for Zoe Ballesteros. So when the California resident started planning a trip to Philadelphia to see Arsenal play this week, she added a stop in Tennessee to check Dollywood off her list.
    

            But instead of soaking up the energy, amusement park food, rides and shows the famous country singer’s theme park and resort has to offer, Ballesteros’ short-lived, two-hour visit ended with her soaked in murky floodwaters from a torrential downpour mother nature instead decided to deliver Sunday evening to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, where Dollywood is located.
    

            A flash flood warning had been issued at 5:39 p.m. for central Sevier County in east Tennessee, which includes Pigeon Forge, according to the National Weather Service. At the time of the alert, “Between 1.5 and 2.5 inches” of rain had fallen in the previous hour. When the warning was extended at 9:33 p.m., the weather service said between 4 and 5 inches had fallen in the Pigeon Forge area. A local road at the park’s entrance collapsed as a result of the rain, Pigeon Forge Police said.

            Dollywood patrons fled the park as brown floodwaters gushed throughout the walkways and spilled into the parking lot where social media images show patrons helping each other wade through knee-deep water, some carrying small children in an effort to return to their vehicles – which in some cases were also submerged in high waters.
    

            Among those fleeing the park were Sarah Myers and her family of six. Myers, who lives 45 minutes from the park, grew up going to Dollywood as a young child. The family members are season pass holders and have been to the park while it has rained before but Myers said Sunday’s rainstorm “was definitely different” in nature.
    

            “It went from being, oh, this is a funny, ironic situation to this is a scary situation,” Myers recalled as her husband carried their 6-year-old in his arms while she lugged a stroller and her 8-, 12- and 14-year-old slowly walked through the floodwaters to their van.
    

            “At one point, my husband said he felt like we were competing in the Oregon Trail because it was just like ‘who’s gonna make it out alive,’” Myers said.
    

            One minor injury was reported, according to a Dollywood park statement from Sunday night. Dollywood could not confirm specific details of the injury, Wes Ramey, Dollywood’s public relations director, told CNN by email Monday.
    

            “Dollywood is supporting guests whose vehicles were affected by this weather event, and cleanup crews have been deployed,” the statement said.

            Despite the park’s effort to keep patrons informed on social media, some guests expressed frustration on X, complaining more wasn’t done to help attendees reach safety.
    

            Ballesteros and two family members bought tickets at 5:18 p.m., she said, while the parking lot was already beginning to flood but she wasn’t aware of the situation inside the park until she got inside.
    

            “Once we got into the actual park, it was only a few hundred yards before we saw the murky water rushing down,” she said. “There were a handful of shops and the Dolly Experience that were open, but no rides or shows.”
    

            “Most employees said they’d never seen anything like it,” Ballesteros said, who plans to return at a later date and is hopeful she’ll be refunded almost $300 she spent on tickets.
    

            Dollywood policy is to offer rain checks and refunds to guests if they request either, Ramey said.
    

            The park plan was scheduled to open at noon Monday, its regularly scheduled time.

CNN_49,Former BBC News presenter Huw Edwards charged with making indecent images of children,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/media/bbc-huw-edwards-charged-intl/index.html,2024-07-30 00:21:00,us,"
            Former BBC News presenter Huw Edwards has been charged with three counts of making indecent images of children, London’s Metropolitan Police said Monday.
    

            The charges related to images allegedly shared on WhatsApp, a police spokesperson said.
    

            Police charged Edwards, a former anchor of the BBC’s News at Ten bulletin, last month, the statement said. He was arrested in November last year, police revealed.
    

            “The offences, which are alleged to have taken place between December 2020 and April 2022, relate to images shared on a WhatsApp chat,” the statement said.
    

            “Edwards was arrested on November 8 2023. He was charged on Wednesday June 26 following authorization from the Crown Prosecution Service.”
    

            Edwards is accused of having six category A images – the most serious classification in English law – 12 category B pictures and 19 category C photographs on WhatsApp. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to 10 years.
    

            The 62-year-old is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Wednesday, police said, reminding media and members of the public not to publish information on social media or elsewhere that could prejudice future court proceedings.
    

            Edwards stepped down from his role at the BBC in late April after a 40-year career during which he became one of the most recognized faces in British television news.
    

            The BBC’s annual report, published last week, revealed that Edwards was paid between £475,000 ($610,000) and £479,999 ($616,000) in the period from April 2023 to March 2024. He was the BBC’s third highest-paid employee in that time.

CNN_50,"Far-right lawmakers break into Israeli detention camp, protesting probe into soldiers’ alleged abuse of prisoner",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/middleeast/sde-teiman-protests-idf-investigation-intl/index.html,2024-07-30 00:25:00,world,"
            Far-right lawmakers and protesters breached the perimeter of a controversial Israeli detention facility for Palestinians on Monday, after the Israeli military confirmed it was investigating soldiers over the alleged abuse of a prisoner.
    

            Footage posted to social media showed chaotic scenes at the Sde Teiman base in Israel’s Negev desert, where far-right Knesset member Zvi Sukkot was filmed slipping through a fence and entering the facility as crowds gathered outside, in protest against the probe. Another video showed people crowding the perimeter of the base as guards held them back.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier in a statement that its Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) was formally looking into the “suspected substantial abuse of a detainee” at the shadowy base, where prisoners from Gaza have allegedly been held under extreme conditions.
    

            In a CNN investigation released in May, Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described widespread abuse at Sde Teiman, including blindfolding and handcuffing.
    

            “The break-in at the Sde Teiman Base is extremely serious and against the law,” Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the IDF’s Chief of the General Staff, said in a statement Monday, adding that the military was “working to restore order at the base.”

            “Breaking into a military base and disturbing the order there is severe behavior that is not acceptable in any way. We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state,” his statement said.
    

            Opposition leader Yair Lapid also condemned the breach, criticizing the “dangerous criminality of (Knesset members) who weaken and dismantle the IDF, weaken and dismantle the state of Israel, gnawing away at the foundations of our power from within.”
    

            “The country is facing an existential threat if these people do not get out of the government and of our lives,” he said  in a post on X.
    

            President Isaac Herzog slammed elected officials for their involvement, and for encouraging what he said was a “dangerous, illegal and irresponsible act.”
    

            Sukkot, who was among those at Sde Teiman on Monday, is a member of the ultra-nationalist Religious Zionism party, which is led by the far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for immediate calm at Sde Teiman and condemned the break-in at the base in a statement on Monday.
    

            Earlier this month, following an international outcry over reports of abuse at the detention facility, Netanyahu told Israel’s Supreme Court that he had ordered an end to long-term imprisonment at the detention center, limiting its use to initial interrogations and a temporary holding facility. The vast majority of prisoners had already been transferred out of the desert facility, according to the Israeli government’s statement to the court at the time.
    

            The Israeli military has previously acknowledged partially converting three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks: Sde Teiman in the Negev desert, as well as Anatot and Ofer military bases in the occupied West Bank.
    

            Last month, Halevi said the military had launched a probe into allegations of mistreatment at Sde Teiman, as well as at Anatot and Ofer.
    

            As part of CNN’s investigation into Sde Teiman, three Israeli whistleblowers said that Palestinian detainees at the base were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners’ limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said. The account tallied with details of a letter authored by a doctor working at Sde Teiman published by Ha’aretz in April.
    

            Several Israeli and Palestinian rights groups, as well as local and international media outlets, also detailed alleged torture and mistreatment at the camp.
    

            Responding to CNN’s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 investigation, the Israeli military said in a statement: “The IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.”
    

            “Detainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.”
    

            The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.

CNN_53,More than half of American renters who want to buy a home fear they’ll never afford one,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/business/millions-of-renters-fear-theyll-never-be-able-to-buy-a-home/index.html,2024-07-30 01:13:00,us,"
            The dream of homeownership feels out of reach for many American families.
    

            The vast majority (86%) of current renters in the United States say they would like to buy a home — but can’t afford one, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS released Monday.
    

            Among those same renters who can’t afford to buy a home right now, 54% think it’s unlikely they’ll ever be able to, the poll found.
    

            The findings underscore the damage done by the one-two punch of surging home prices and elevated mortgage rates, creating an affordability crisis. And given that homeownership is the ticket to wealth generation in America, that pessimism exacerbates the risk that the divide between the haves and have-nots will only grow.
    

            Younger people especially are having trouble buying a home right now. The CNN poll found that 90% of renters younger than 45 say they’d like to buy but can’t afford it, compared with 79% of those age 45 and above.
    

            Not surprisingly, younger Americans are more hopeful that situation will change.
    

            Most adults (53%) younger than 45 who want to buy but can’t afford it believe it’s at least somewhat likely they’ll eventually be able to buy a home. That’s compared with just 32% of those 45 and older.
    

            Even some working parents in high-paying jobs are struggling to keep up with the spike in home prices.
    

            Brent Bjornsen, a 39-year-old pediatrician and father of two in Phoenix is renting a home as he digs out from student debt.
    

            “Buying a home is absolutely something we would love to do,” Bjornsen told CNN. “It seems out of reach.”
    

            Bjornsen said his wife works part-time at an elementary school. The couple was dealt a financial setback when Hurricane Harvey flooded their Houston apartment.
    

            “We’re straddled with seemingly insurmountable debt,” he said. “Homeownership seems impossible…and that hurts for two kids of Baby Boomers and feels like a disappointment.”
    

            Two-thirds of Americans currently renting (68%) say their family owned a home when they were growing up, according to the CNN poll.
    

            The good news is that mortgage rates — one of the main obstacles to homeownership — have eased a bit. in recent months. And if the Federal Reserve is able to deliver interest rate cuts this fall and winter, rates could fall further.
    

            However, home prices continue to rise. A price spike that began during the pandemic has pushed home ownership out of reach for many.
    

            The median existing-home price climbed to a record of $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was 4.1% higher than a year earlier and the second straight month of record home prices on data going back to 1999.
    

            Among renters who want to buy but can’t afford it, 40% say the biggest barrier is saving for a down payment, according to the CNN poll.
    

            Nearly a third (31%) say the biggest obstacle to buying a home is high interest rates. Just 17% say the inability to qualify for a mortgage is the biggest hurdle.
    

            Jeremy Andersson, a digital marketing specialist living north of Atlanta, is among those Millennials who have lost hope.
    

            “We have given up on homeownership,” Andersson told CNN.
    

            The 40-year-old father of twin toddlers wanted to buy a home when his wife became pregnant in 2019.
    

            “We felt the societal pressure to buy a house because that’s the American Dream, right? Have a family and buy a house,” he said.
    

            Seventy percent of Americans call owning a home essential to achieving the American dream, the CNN poll found. That includes about two-thirds (65%) of those currently renting.
    

            But like other families, Andersson and his wife were dismayed by what they could afford.
    

            “I’m not going to pay $350,000 for a run-down house. It almost seems laughable. We can’t find anything affordable for a family of four,” he said. “I’m not going to play your game anymore. I’m done.”
    

            In some markets, starter homes are fetching nearly three times that price.
    

            According to Zillow, the typical starter home is now worth $1 million or more in 237 cities. That’s up from just 84 cities in 2019 before Covid.
    

            Perhaps that’s why many homeowners don’t think they’ll be able to buy in this market.
    

            The CNN poll found that just about one-third (32%) of current homeowners think they could afford to buy a similar home in their neighborhood today.
    

            Even among households earning $100,000 a year or more, most doubt they’d be able to afford to buy something similar today.
    

            “We did everything we were supposed to do. We went to college. We did well. We got jobs. We’re not felons,” Andersson said. “I’ve worked my tail off and so has my wife.”
    

            This situation has taken an emotional toll on Andersson.
    

            “At first, I wondered if I was a failure as a father or husband because I can’t get my kids a lawn to play on,” he said. “It’s taken a lot of soul-searching to understand this is not my fault. It’s the fault of a poorly planned system.”
    

  The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from June 3-24, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21, among a random national sample of 2,021 adults initially reached by mail, and 407 adults reached by random digit dialing to a sample of prepaid cellphone numbers. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

CNN_54,"At least eight injured, including children, after knife attack in northern England",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/uk/northern-england-stabbing-intl/index.html,2024-07-30 01:13:00,world,"
            At least eight people, including children, were injured in a knife attack close to a Taylor Swift-themed yoga class in a town in northern England, according to police and eyewitnesses.
    

            Merseyside Police said it received reports of a stabbing in Southport, north of Liverpool. Emergency services were called to a “major incident” in the town at around 11:50 a.m. local time (6:50aET). A 17-year-old boy was arrested at the scene.
    

            “At this early stage, enquiries are ongoing to establish the motive for this tragic incident and we would urge people not to speculate while the investigation is ongoing,” police said. “We can also confirm that the incident is not currently being treated as terror-related and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.”
    

            Local business owner Colin Parry was one of the people who called the police, said the incident in Southport was like a “scene in a horror movie,” according to PA Media.
    

            Parry said he believed a number of young girls had been stabbed. “The mothers are coming here now and screaming. It is like a scene from a horror movie,” Parry said, adding that “police have got him.”
    

            The businessman said he had directed police to an address in Hart Street behind the Hart Space studios, where one of the events listed at the time of the stabbings was aTaylor Swift-themed yoga class for children ages six to 11, according to its website.
    

            “It’s like something from America, not like sunny Southport,” Parry said.
    

            One resident, who lives in Hart Street but did not wish to be naed, told PA Media that a woman pulled up outside his house in her car, screaming. He said: “She was screaming ‘my daughter’s been stabbed’.
    

            “The woman was in hysterics. Then two police cars rushed up the street the other way. It was a mum with her 10-year-old daughter who had been stabbed.”
    

            “I helped to get her back up to where the police cars and ambulances were. She didn’t look great but my focus was on getting her back up the street to  get help.
    

            “When I got back up the street there were a couple of kids on the floor being seen to by paramedics and, as I came back, more police cars were going down and more ambulances gradually started to arrive.”
    

            The Alder Hey Children’s Hospital Trust in Liverpool, about 20 miles from Southport, declared a “major incident.”
    

            “The Trust is working with other emergency services to respond to this incident and our Emergency Department is currently extremely busy,” the hospital said in a statement posted to its website. “We ask parents to only bring their children to the Emergency Department if it is urgent,” it said.
    

            The British MP representing Southport, Patrick Hurley says he was “deeply concerned” about the “incident.”
    

            “I am hoping for the best possible outcomes to the casualties affected. My thoughts go out to all those affected, their loved ones and to the entire community,” Hurley said on X.

CNN_55,Here’s what a Harris presidency could look like,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/27/politics/kamala-harris-key-issues/index.html,2024-07-30 02:56:00,politics,"
            A week after announcing her run for president, Kamala Harris has yet to tell voters how she will address the key issues facing the nation.
    

            The vice president’s platform will likely be in the same vein as that of President Joe Biden, whom she has supported for the past four years.
    

            But Harris is expected to put her own stamp and style on matters ranging from abortion to the economy to immigration. Also, she’ll have to walk a fine line of taking credit for the administration’s accomplishments while not being jointly blamed by voters for its shortcomings.

Of 49 US VPs, only 4 accomplished what Harris is attempting


            Her initial presidential campaign speeches offer some insights into her priorities, though she’s mainly voiced general talking points and not more nuanced plans. Like Biden, she intends to contrast her vision for America with that of former President Donald Trump.
    

            “In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” she told members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta at an event in Indianapolis on Wednesday. “And with your support, I am fighting for our nation’s future.”
    

            That path forward focuses on lifting up working and middle-class Americans, enabling them to join unions, retire with dignity, live without the fear of gun violence and obtain affordable health care, she said. Harris has also touted the Biden administration’s efforts to lower drug costs, reduce child poverty, forgive student loan debt and remove medical debt from credit reports.
    

            Here’s what we know about Harris’ views:
    

            Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic.
    

            On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions.
    

            Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger.
    

            High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath.
    

            In her early campaign speeches, Harris has echoed many of the same themes as Biden, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead. She’s particularly concerned about making care – health care, child care, elder care and family leave – more affordable and available.
    

            A look at her 2020 campaign promises reveals a more progressive bent than Biden.
    

            As a senator and 2020 presidential candidate, Harris proposed providing middle-class and working families with a refundable tax credit of up to $6,000 a year (per couple) to help keep up with living expenses. Titled the LIFT the Middle Class Act, or Livable Incomes for Families Today, the measure would have cost at the time an estimated $3 trillion over 10 years.
    

            Unlike a typical tax credit, the bill would allow taxpayers to receive the benefit – up to $500 – on a monthly basis so families don’t have to turn to payday loans with very high interest rates.
    

            As a presidential candidate, Harris also advocated for raising the corporate income tax rate to 35%, where it was before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through Congress reduced the rate to 21%. That’s higher than the 28% Biden has proposed.
    

            Affordable housing was also on Harris’ radar. As a senator, she introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would establish a refundable tax credit for renters who annually spend more than 30% of their gross income on rent and utilities. The amount of the credit would range from 25% to 100% of the excess rent, depending on the renter’s income.
    

            Harris called housing a human right and said in a 2019 news release on the bill that every American deserves to have basic security and dignity in their own home.
    

            Hefty debt loads, which weigh on people’s finances and hurt their ability to buy homes, get car loans or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Harris.
    

            As vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far forgiven more than $168 billion for nearly 4.8 million borrowers. In mid-July, Harris said in a post on X that “nearly 950,000 public servants have benefitted” from student debt forgiveness, compared with only 7,000 when Biden was inaugurated.
    

            A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a program aimed at cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly 3 million borrowers enrolled in a repayment plan the administration implemented last year.
    

            The vice president has also been a leader in the White House efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills.
    

            In a late July statement praising North Carolina’s move to relieve the medical debt of about 2 million residents, Harris said that she is “committed to continuing to relieve the burden of medical debt and creating a future where every person has the opportunity to build wealth and thrive.”
    

            Harris advocated for shifting the US to a government-backed health insurance system but stopped short of wanting to completely eliminate private insurance during her 2020 campaign. The measure called for transitioning to a Medicare-for-All-type system over 10 years but continuing to allow private insurance companies to offer Medicare plans.
    

            The proposal would not have raised taxes on the middle class to pay for the coverage expansion. Instead, it would raise the needed funds by taxing Wall Street trades and transactions and changing the taxation of offshore corporate income.
    

            When it comes to reducing drug costs, Harris previously proposed allowing the federal government to set “a fair price” for any drug sold at a cheaper price in any economically comparable country, including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Japan or Australia. If manufacturers were found to be price gouging, the government could import their drugs from abroad or, in egregious cases, use its existing but never-used “march-in” authority to license a drug company’s patent to a rival that would produce the medication at a lower cost.
    

            Harris has been a champion on climate and environmental justice for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. During her 2020 campaign, she supported a fracking ban but walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate.
    

            Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Democrats and climate activists are planning to campaign on the stark contrasts between Harris and Trump, who vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments.
    

            If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement.
    

            Biden tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
    

            Harris has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. But she put her own stamp on the administration’s efforts, engaging the private sector.
    

            Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region.
    

            Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments.
    

            The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October.
    

            After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza.
    

            “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent,” she said.

            Harris echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.”
    

            However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.”
    

            She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time.”
    

            Harris emphasized the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity, naming the eight Israeli-American hostages – three of whom have been killed.
    

            But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.”
    

            Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana.
    

            Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, having met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announcing last month $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs and other aid for the war-torn country.
    

            At the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, Harris said: “I will make clear President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine. In partnership with supportive, bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress, we will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. And let me be clear: The failure to do so would be a gift to Vladimir Putin.”
    

            “More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known,” she said.

CNN_56,US calls on Venezuelan government to release specific data on election,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/us-calls-venezuelan-election-data/index.html,2024-07-30 02:07:00,politics,"
            The United States is calling on the Venezuelan government to “immediately” release specific data regarding its presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of strongman leader Nicolas Maduro’s victory.
    

            Senior Biden administration officials on Monday said Venezuelan election authorities must release the “detailed precinct level results” from the election. One senior administration official noted that this data is required under Venezuela law and should be immediately available. Another said that if the election results are credible, “then this should be a very simple act and one that they would be able to fulfill quite easily.”
    

            “If there is resistance to providing that additional information, then I think that becomes highly problematic when it comes to the ability of the United States or other members of the international community to judge whether these elections were in fact inclusive and credible,” the second official said.
    

            “Our deepest concern at this juncture is that the analysis and data that we have about this election – which is independent from the National Electoral Council results – is at odds with the results as they were announced by the Venezuelan authorities. And so that discrepancy, in our view, needs to be investigated and addressed before we can close the books on this election,” the second official added.
    

            The officials declined to give specifics on the actions the US or international community would be prepared to take if the Venezuelan authorities do not release the data or if the results are determined to be fraudulent, but they did not rule out sanctions. However, “it is not currently under consideration that we would retroactively alter licenses that have previously been given,” like that of Chevron, the second official said.
    

            The first official said they would begin to have conversations in forums like the Organization of American States (OAS) and the G7 about the “collective way forward.”
    

            “We will continue to assess our sanctions policy towards Venezuela in light of overall US national foreign policy interests, the actions and non-actions that are taken by Maduro and his representatives, and the overall direction of travel as it relates to our broader US bilateral engagement with Venezuela,” the second official said.
    

            The officials defended the sanctions relief given under the Biden administration, suggesting that Sunday’s election would not have taken place as it did without that relief.
    

            “Despite all the problems which we’re discussing now, the fact that Venezuela did in fact hold an election yesterday, which allowed an opposition candidate to be on the ballot and for voting process to unfold only came about as a result of the calibrations that we’ve done with our sanctions policy over the last year,” the second official said. “Now that we are faced with potentially a new scenario, we are going to take that into account as we map forward where we may had with respect to sanctions towards Venezuela.”
    

            The first official argued that Sunday’s election, at which international observers were present, “gives us a tremendous amount of data about the will of Venezuelan voters in the face of a lack of transparency by the Venezuelan (election commission).”
    

            “I would argue that we’re in a much better position now than we were three years ago,” the official said.

CNN_57,A historic mining community is decimated as the Park Fire and other massive wildfires rage in the Western United States,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-paradise-california-chico/index.html,2024-07-30 02:31:00,us,"
Wildfires are raging out of control in the Western United States and Canada – destroying homes, forcing evacuations and injuring residents. One inferno has reportedly destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah. Another has scorched more than 360,000 acres of California – an area larger than the city of Phoenix. Here’s the latest:


            • Borel Fire ravages historic mining community: The fire in Kern County, California, “swept through the community of Havilah and Piute Meadows Ranches,” CalFire said. Havilah was discovered in 1864 and for more than 20 years served as an active mining center, according to California State Parks. The Borel Fire had burned more than 50,000 acres and had zero containment as of Sunday night.

            • Hope for stopping wildfires’ spread: The weather forecast for the Northwest calls for lighter winds than the area has seen in recent days, giving firefighters some optimism about slowing the progress of the Park Fire, along with more than 100 large wildfires burning across the region, consuming thousands of acres. Temperatures across much of the West will be at or below average to start this week, with forecast highs through Tuesday ranging between the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and the 70s and 80s in the inland Pacific Northwest.
    

            • Park Fire is largest active wildfire in the US: The Park Fire, the seventh-largest wildfire in California history, is now at more than 360,000 acres or 560 square miles. The fire has destroyed 100 structures and threatens thousands more, according to CalFire. It was 12% contained as of Monday morning but evacuations warnings or orders remained in Butte, Tehama, Plumas and Shasta counties. Lower winds from the south could help take pressure off the fire’s eastern edge. President Joe Biden has directed his administration to do everything possible to support ongoing fire suppression efforts, according to a White House official.
    

            • Arson suspect to be arraigned Monday: A 42-year-old man, identified as Ronnie Dean Stout II, has been arrested after being accused of igniting the Park Fire. The man is suspected of pushing a burning car 60 feet into a gully, spreading flames that caused the inferno, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said.

            • Progress fighting Durkee Fire in Oregon: The Durkee Fire is the largest wildfire burning in Oregon, at more than 288,000 acres. It has injured three people and destroyed four residences. The fire was 49% contained as of Monday morning, according to InciWeb, and the figure could improve as winds calm and humidity levels moderate.
    

            • Crews to see more challenges in Jasper, Alberta: Though weekend rain helped firefighters combat the Jasper Wildfire Complex – the park’s largest wildfire in more than a century – warmer weather in the days ahead might present further challenges. Temperatures in the area have dropped and there is a chance of showers Monday, with highs expected in the upper 60s to mid-70s and rising through the week. Wildfire danger for the southern areas of the province remain very high to extreme, according to Melissa Story, spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. “This area did not see the moisture as the other areas of the province did,” Story said.
    

            • Air tanker pilot who died fighting fire in Oregon identified: James Bailey Maxwell, an experienced pilot who logged about 24,000 hours of flight time in his 54 years of flying, died after his single-engine air tanker crashed while working near the Falls Fire in Oregon Thursday, according to a statement from the US Forest Service – Malheur National Forest. “He is survived by and will be missed by family members in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington,” the statement said. The Falls Fire began on July 10 and has since burned more than 142,000 acres and is 57% contained as of Sunday, according to InciWeb.
    

            The Borel Fire has destroyed the historic mining community of Havilah, with only a few buildings left standing, the Los Angeles Times reported.
    

            “We lost everything — it’s all gone,” resident Sean Rains told the Times on Sunday. “This whole town burned down. Multiple people, friends that I know — everybody lost everything.”

            The number of homes and businesses destroyed in Havilah – population 250 – is still being assessed, fire officials said at a weekend news conference. But evacuation orders have been in effect, according to Jim Snow, one of the incident commanders.
    

            Fueled in part by red-flag conditions – such as warm temperatures, very low humidities and strong winds – the Borel Fire has exploded in growth. It scorched 30,000 acres in a 24-hour period, Snow said.
    

            Despite 1,200 personnel assigned to the inferno, the blaze was 0% contained as of Sunday.
    

            “Some of those edges of the fire, with rapid growth, we’re having to chase down rather than stand in front of it,” Snow said. “We have had some light injuries on the incident – a lot of heat-related injuries.”
    

            Cloud and smoke coverage allowed firefighters to increase containment lines around the Park Fire Saturday, but the challenges returned on Sunday, CalFire Incident Commander Billy See said.
    

            While some areas were downgraded from evacuation orders to warnings, spot fires prevented officials from lifting or changing more orders and warnings, officials said.
    

            “We are working really hard to get people back into their house as soon as possible,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea.
    

            Conditions have not been favorable for crews, Yuba City Fire Department spokesperson and firefighter Jeremy Hollingshead told CNN.
    

            “It was a wind-driven fire, it was a topography-driven fire, fuel-driven fire, everything was stacked against us,” Hollingshead said. “At that point in time, we threw everything we had at it, but again, we’re not going to put anybody at the head of this thing. What we had to do was put crews in the high-risk areas, where structures could possibly burn and do the best work they can there.”
    

            He added firefighters took advantage of more favorable conditions to try and get a better handle on the blaze.
    

            “Firefighters right now, from the sky to the ground, they’re taking advantage of the break we do have in the weather, so hopefully in the next few days we can mitigate a lot of that threat,” Hollingshead said.
    

            Chico, California, the largest city in Butte County where the Park Fire is ongoing, will see temperatures in the low 90s for Monday and Tuesday, a significant drop from the triple digit temperatures of last week. Winds continue to decrease for the Park Fire area as well, with sustained winds below 10 mph Monday, and as low as 5 mph by Tuesday.
    

            There is even a weak storm system approaching the Pacific Northwest, expected to bring some shower chances. This amount of rainfall is helpful as it doesn’t lead to as great of flash flooding risk for burn scars.
    

            The massive Park Fire, believed to be the result of arson, forced thousands to flee their homes after igniting Wednesday near Chico, California, consuming thousands of acres per hour, burning dozens of structures and leaving behind graveyards of burned trees and cars.
    

            Retired Chico firefighter John Maretti told CNN he has lost his house in the Park Fire despite preparing as best he knew how.
    

            “I bought a bulldozer. We cleared things out. We made sure that we had a Class A roof and non-flammable walls. We did a lot. We had sprinklers. We had hoses. I mean, I’m a firefighter. I set this up for maximum opportunity for the house to make it and it did not, Maretti said. “There’s just no way that anybody could have survived with this house.”
    

            Despite the destruction of his property, Maretti said he felt fortunate the household – including two dogs and a cat – had escaped unharmed – something he credited, in part, to breaking his ankle last Monday.
    

            “I felt very capable staying. And I have hoses, I have all sorts of equipment, but with a broken ankle, there’s just no choice. I had to leave. And fortunately, because I had the broken ankle, I probably saved my life, because I probably would have stayed and tried to fight it, which would have been the wrong decision,” he said.
    

            Maretti said the speed at which the fire had spread wasn’t what he was used to.
    

            “So this was just a lot faster fire than I’d ever seen,” Maretti said. “This is just an angry fire, and completely different than anything I’ve ever seen before.”
    

            A Tehama County resident described to CNN affiliate KOVR fleeing the Park Fire on the only exit road out of their neighborhood – which the blaze had already jumped.
    

            “When we saw the fire coming over the ridge, which it did, it was coming at us. We thought that was bad. And then we put everything in the car and took off,” Jim Young told KOVR.
    

            “We get on the highway and it is burning on both sides for 10 miles. It was like driving through an inferno,” Young said.
    

            The Park Fire is burning in Butte County, where California’s deadliest wildfire, the Camp Fire, killed more than 85 people and destroyed thousands of homes in 2018.
    

            Bruce Hey and his brother-in-law Christopher Apel told KOVR that the blaze had forced them to evacuate their adjoining properties in the Cohasset area.
    

            “We had a lot of people who were staying there from the Camp Fire and … and everything is burning,” Apel told KOVR.
    

            Hey said that he drove through the blaze to safety, but burned his arm in the process.
    

            “I tried to outrun it,” he said. “I wouldn’t have gotten burned if I hadn’t rolled down the window to look in the rearview mirror. I was right in the middle of it and I was trying to put it in reverse.”
    

            Jasper, a popular tourist town in the middle of Alberta’s Jasper National Park, has seen widespread destruction due to the wildfire there, which has scorched just under 90,000 acres.
    

            The park remains closed and more than 17,000 people are still under evacuation orders, Jose Tilney, deputy managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday afternoon.
    

            Almost 40% of all structures in the city have been destroyed by the Jasper Wildlife Complex fire, data released Saturday by the Municipality of Jasper show.
    

            Of the 1,113 structures in the town, 410 were reported to be destroyed, and 10 sustained visible damage, the Jasper Rapid Visual Damage Assessment said.
    

            The fire remains “out-of-control and is expected to become more active over the coming days with warmer weather,” Parks Canada said.

CNN_58,Two children killed and nine injured in knife attack at dance class in northern England,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/uk/northern-england-stabbing-intl/index.html,2024-07-30 02:25:00,world,"
            Two children have been killed and nine others injured in a knife attack targeting a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in a town in northern England on Monday, police said.
    

            Merseyside Police’s Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said six of the injured children are in critical condition, and added that the attack has also left two adults in critical condition.
    

            Kennedy said that the police understands the attacker walked into the premises armed with a knife and started to attack the children.
    

            “We believe that the adults who were injured were bravely trying to protect the children who were being attacked,” she said at a news conference on Monday evening.
    

            Merseyside Police said it received reports of a stabbing in Southport, north of Liverpool. Emergency services were called to a “major incident” in the town at around 11:50 a.m. local time (6:50aET). A 17-year-old boy was arrested at the scene.
    

            “The investigation is in its early stages and the motivation for the incident remains unclear. However Counterterrorism Police Northwest have offered their support,” Kennedy said.
    

            The police said earlier the incident was not treated as terror-related.
    

            Local business owner Colin Parry was one of the people who called the police, said the incident in Southport was like a “scene in a horror movie,” according to PA Media.
    

            Parry said he believed a number of young girls had been stabbed. “The mothers are coming here now and screaming. It is like a scene from a horror movie,” Parry said, adding that “police have got him.”
    

            The businessman said he had directed police to an address in Hart Street behind the Hart Space studios, where one of the events listed at the time of the stabbings was aTaylor Swift-themed yoga and dance class for children ages six to 11, according to its website.
    

            “It’s like something from America, not like sunny Southport,” Parry said.
    

            One resident, who lives in Hart Street but did not wish to be naed, told PA Media that a woman pulled up outside his house in her car, screaming. He said: “She was screaming ‘my daughter’s been stabbed’.
    

            “The woman was in hysterics. Then two police cars rushed up the street the other way. It was a mum with her 10-year-old daughter who had been stabbed.”
    

            “I helped to get her back up to where the police cars and ambulances were. She didn’t look great but my focus was on getting her back up the street to  get help.
    

            “When I got back up the street there were a couple of kids on the floor being seen to by paramedics and, as I came back, more police cars were going down and more ambulances gradually started to arrive.”
    

            The Alder Hey Children’s Hospital Trust in Liverpool, about 20 miles from Southport, declared a “major incident.”
    

            “The Trust is working with other emergency services to respond to this incident and our Emergency Department is currently extremely busy,” the hospital said in a statement posted to its website. “We ask parents to only bring their children to the Emergency Department if it is urgent,” it said.
    

            The British MP representing Southport, Patrick Hurley says he was “deeply concerned” about the “incident.”
    

            “I am hoping for the best possible outcomes to the casualties affected. My thoughts go out to all those affected, their loved ones and to the entire community,” Hurley said on X.

CNN_59,"Iran using covert influence campaign to undermine Trump candidacy, US intelligence says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/iran-covert-influence-campaign-trump/index.html,2024-07-30 03:57:00,politics,"
            Iran is using covert social media activity and related influence operations in an effort to undercut the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, a US intelligence official said Monday in an updated assessment of threats to the November election.
    

            The US intelligence community has “observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,” the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.
    

            The recent Iranian influence activity has come in the form of “covert social media accounts and related activity,” the official from ODNI said at a media briefing when CNN asked for examples of the activity.
    

            Iran’s preference for a US presidential candidate has not changed since 2020, the ODNI official said. In the 2020 election campaign, Iran “carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut former President Trump’s reelection prospects,” according to a declassified US intelligence report.
    

            Russia’s preferences for the presidential race also haven’t shifted since 2020, when Moscow conducted a range of influence operations in support of Trump and aimed at denigrating Joe Biden, the ODNI official said.
    

            “Iran does not engage in any objectives or activities intended to influence the U.S. election,” the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations said in a statement to CNN. “A significant portion of such accusations are characterized by psychological operations designed to artificially pep up election campaigns.”
    

            As president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani’s death.
    

            The alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.
    

            US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. There’s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, was connected to the Iranian plot.
    

            Iran has denied the assassination plot allegations.
    

            Foreign influence actors have used the attempted assassination of Trump “as part of their narratives, portraying the event to fit their broader goals,” the ODNI official said without offering examples.
    

            Iran is also attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the Israel-Hamas conflict by posing as activists online and in some cases providing financial support to protesters, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said this month.
    

            “Tehran relies on vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation and have notably been active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict,” the ODNI said in its statement on Monday.
    

            The updated intelligence assessment covers a range of covert and overt influence activity, showing that the number of foreign actors targeting US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin’s sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.
    

            “Russia remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,” ODNI said in its assessment on Monday. Moscow is using Russia-based “influence-for-hire” firms that are getting better at tailoring content to American audiences, US officials said.
    

            CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. The Russian government regularly denies US allegations of election influence.
    

            China “probably does not plan to influence the outcome” of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could “denigrate down-ballot candidates,” the updated assessment says.
    

            Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN previously reported.

            An earthquake shook the Los Angeles region Monday afternoon.
    

            The US Geological Survey reported a 4.9 magnitude quake with an epicenter near Barstow, California – about 103 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The quake was at a depth of nearly five miles, according to the USGS.
    

            The magnitude was downgraded from an initial report of 5.1.
    

            The USGS also reported quakes of 3.5 and 2.7 magnitude in the minutes following the first earthquake.

CNN_61,"Joaquín Guzmán López, son of ‘El Chapo,’ surrendered to authorities, Mexico says, citing US authorities",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/sinaloa-cartel-arrests-monday/index.html,2024-07-30 03:33:00,us,"
            Joaquín Guzmán López, the son of Mexican drug lord “El Chapo,” surrendered to US authorities on Thursday, leading to the arrest of alleged cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, Mexico’s Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection Rosa Icela Rodríguez, citing information from American officials.
    

            At a news conference Monday, Rodríguez presented a chronology of the arrest, based on an official report US authorities provided Saturday at the request of the Mexican government.
    

            According to the report, US authorities were notified on several occasions Guzmán López was considering surrendering, but it was not until that same day his intention was confirmed without prior notice, according to the report.
    

            “US law enforcement authorities were informed at approximately 2:40 p.m., once the plane was in the air, that Ismael Zambada García might also be on board the aircraft,” Rodríguez said.
    

            The comments offer further details about the stunning arrests of two central figures in the infamous Sinaloa cartel last week in a case which featured dramatic allegations of a high-level power struggle, the betrayal of one co-founder by another co-founder’s son and a secret flight ending in American law enforcement’s custody.
    

            Zambada, the cartel’s alleged co-founder, and Guzmán López, one of the “Chapitos,” or sons of “El Chapo,” were arrested Thursday by US authorities in El Paso, Texas. They face several charges for allegedly leading the criminal operations of what is considered to be one of the world’s most powerful and deadly drug trafficking operations.
    

            US law enforcement officials told CNN the arrest came after Guzmán López duped Zambada and orchestrated their arrest. Zambada thought the two were flying to northern Mexico to look at real estate, but instead, their small private plane landed north of the border near El Paso, where US authorities were waiting on the tarmac, officials said.
    

            Rodríguez had said Friday the Mexican government was not part of any operation to detain the alleged drug lords, and the country’s president called on the US to explain what happened.
    

            “The government of the United States has to give a complete report. It can’t be just general statements,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday. “There has to be transparency.”

One of the biggest cartel busts in recent memory began with an act of betrayal


            A law enforcement source familiar with the situation told CNN US officials were hesitant to brief Mexican counterparts in advance due to fears the operation could have been compromised. Details on the operation were also highly restricted within the US government until Zambada and Guzmán López were taken into custody, the source said.
    

            In a phone conversation and a statement sent to CNN, Zambada’s attorney Frank Pérez said Zambada was kidnapped.
    

            “Joaquín Guzmán López forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied, and a black bag was placed over his head,” Pérez said in a statement.
    

            “He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane, his legs tied to the seat by Joaquin, and brought to the US against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquín and my client.”
    

            The cartel, one of the world’s most powerful narcotics trafficking organizations, is thought to be responsible for the trafficking of vast amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the United States. US Drug Enforcement Administration chief Anne Milgram said the arrests strike “at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.”
    

            Zambada, 76, entered a not guilty plea to all charges in US District Court in El Paso on Friday and is scheduled to appear in-person in the same court for a status conference August 1 at 11 a.m. local time, according to Perez and filed court documents.
    

            Guzmán López, 38, is expected to appear in federal court Tuesday in Chicago, his attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, told CNN. He was previously indicted by a federal grand jury in Illinois on narcotics, money laundering and firearms charges, according to a statement last year from the US Justice Department.
    

            The Sinaloa cartel was founded in the late 1980s and led by El Chapo, who twice escaped from Mexican prisons before being detained by Mexican authorities in 2016.
    

            The cartel has been blamed for having a key role in the drug war that plagued Mexico for years, leaving tens of thousands of people dead, as well as contributing to the ongoing high levels of violence across the country.
    

            In the early 2010s, estimates indicated the cartel controlled roughly 40% to 60% of Mexico’s drug trade, earning as much as $3 billion annually, according to a Congressional Research Service report.


            El Chapo was extradited to the US in 2017 and convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, drug trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy to commit murder. He is serving a life sentence in US federal prison.
    

            Since then, experts believe the cartel has faced several challenges after breaking into factions – including some led by Zambada and Guzman’s sons – and with the rise of rival cartels.

What we know about the Sinaloa cartel and its leaders


            FBI Director Christopher Wray said both Zambada and Guzmán López had “eluded law enforcement for decades.”
    

            Zambada was indicted by a northern Illinois grand jury in 2009, according to the US State Department, and faces various criminal charges. In 2021, the US raised the reward for information leading to his arrest to $15 million.
    

            “Ismael Mario Zambada Garcia is the long-time leader of the Zambada Garcia faction of the Sinaloa Cartel,” according to the US State Department. “Zambada Garcia is unique in that he has spent his entire adult life as a major international drug trafficker, yet he has never spent a day in jail.”
    

            Meanwhile, Guzmán López is one of the “Chapitos,” a term for the powerful sons of former cartel boss El Chapo.
    

            “The Chapitos are alleged to have repeatedly and consistently transported lethal amounts of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl,” the Justice Department said last year.
    

            Zambada’s son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, admitted during testimony at Guzman’s 2018 trial to passing along orders for murders and kidnappings. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2019 by a federal judge in Chicago. He began cooperating with the US government in 2011, prosecutors said in a May 2019 filing.

CNN_62,Google’s Olympics ad went viral for all the wrong reasons,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/tech/googles-ai-olympics-ad-backlash/index.html,2024-07-30 04:15:00,us,"
            Remember the universal childhood experience of writing a fan letter to someone you admire? (Mickey Mouse, I hope you still have that note I gave you at Disneyland in 1999.)
    

            Well, a new Google ad says artificial intelligence can now do that for you. It’s not going over well.
    

            In case you haven’t seen it, the TV advertisement — which played during ad breaks from the Olympics — shows a father describing his daughter’s love for American Olympic track star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. It shows the young girl training to compete like her hero, thanks to hurdling technique tips generated by Google’s AI search feature. Then the dad says “she wants to show Sydney some love,” and asks Google’s Gemini chatbot to generate a letter from his daughter to McLaughlin, including a line noting that the young girl “plans on breaking her world record.”
    

            The ad demonstrated the Google AI tool’s ability to generate increasingly human-sounding text, a capability the company has said could be used for everything from writing work emails to trip plans. But to many critics online, the ad appeared to be the latest example of a Big Tech company being disconnected from real people. The ad inspired dozens of posts on Threads, X, LinkedIn and elsewhere, where many people who watched it were asking: Why would anyone want to replace a child’s creativity and authentic expression with words written by a computer?
    

            It’s a striking miss for the tech giant, which has positioned Gemini as its answer to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and is working to incorporate the AI technology throughout its suite of products, including Google Search and Gmail.
    

            “The Google commercial where the dad has his daughter use AI to construct a note to her favorite athlete rather than encourage her to write what she actually wants to tell her hero takes a little chunk out of my soul every time I see it,” writer and founder of sports blog Deadspin Will Leitch said on X, in a post that was reposted more than 3,000 times.
    

            “These people have lost the plot,” another person said of the ad in a post on Threads, calling AI ads in general “just mortifying.”
    

            The backlash underscored a broader fear about artificial intelligence, as the technology permeates more and more areas of our lives: Tech companies have promised that AI will make our lives easier by removing the need for humans to complete menial tasks, like grocery shopping, coding or translation, that could otherwise be done by computers, freeing them up to spend time on more meaningful pursuits. But many early AI tools seem to do the opposite, instead enabling computers to generate traditionally human creative outputs such as art, music and stories.
    

            Some creatives, including musicians and visual artists, have already raised alarms about AI replacing them — and it was a central issue in last year’s Hollywood writers’ strike. And others have sued tech firms over the alleged use of their copyrighted works to train their AI models.
    

            And yet tech firms have forged ahead with rolling out AI tools that can create new emojis, speak and even generate videos.
    

            “I flatly reject the future that Google is advertising,” Shelly Palmer, professor of advanced media at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, said in a blog post on Sunday. “I want to live in a culturally diverse world where billions of individuals use AI to amplify their human skills, not in a world where we are used by AI pretending to be human.”
    

            Apple faced similar backlash earlier this year when it released an ad for that showed symbols of human creativity – paint cans, musical instruments, a sculptural bust of a human head – being crushed by a giant hydraulic press and replaced by an iPad Pro, to the tune of Sonny & Cher’s “All I Need Is You.” Apple quickly apologized for “missing the mark” with the advertisement.
    

            Google did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the backlash to the Gemini ad.

CNN_63,Protest erupts in Venezuela as questions grow over strongman Maduro’s victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/americas/venezuela-election-results-maduro-opposition-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-30 04:56:00,world,"
            Protests broke out in several Venezuelan cities on Monday after authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro was formally declared a winner by the county’s electoral authority in a presidential race marred by accusations of electoral fraud.
    

            In the capital of Caracas, protesters blocked roads, while hundreds more were seen walking down a main road banging pots and pans in protest against Maduro’s victory on Sunday. At the city’s main military base, where Maduro lives, people were seen setting fire to the strongman’s election posters.
    

            Protests were also reported in other cities, including Maracay, where opposition activist Esthefania Natera told CNN that people were on the streets “to yell and demand to tell the truth because we know the real results.” She said police were using teargas on peaceful protesters. In the coastal state of Falcón, demonstrators toppled a statue of Maduro, video on social media showed.
    

            The next 24 hours will be key in seeing how Maduro responds to the allegations against him. Analysts say there could be a new wave of unrest in the country if there are widespread protests against the regime. Street demonstrations in previous years were crushed by the country’s military, which has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.
    

            Maduro smiled as he entered the National Electoral Council (CNE) before a Monday ceremony at which he was declared the winner, receiving cheers and congratulations from many in the audience. The CNE, which is stacked with Maduro allies, has yet to issue final vote tallies from Sunday’s election.
    

            “Venezuela has the best electoral system in the world!” CNE president Elvis Amoroso announced before proceeding with the formal announcement.
    

            But the vote was riddled with claims of irregularities. It included opposition witnesses being denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters as votes were counted and the electoral authority allegedly prevented more votes from being processed.
    

            Maduro’s government controls almost all state institutions, including the CNE, which was accused in 2017 of manipulating turnout figures by a software company that provided the voting technology. The CNE previously denied the assertion.
    

            The opposition coalition, headed by Maria Corina Machado, earlier rejected Maduro’s win, saying the opposition’s records show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez received 70% of the votes against Maduro’s 30%. “We won, and everyone knows it,” Machado said. The coalition plans on making a statement later on Monday.
    

            Machado is part of a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. Its energized campaign, which enjoyed strong polling figures prior to Sunday’s vote, was seen as the biggest challenge to Maduro’s rule.
    

            The United States is among regional leaders, including Peru and Chile, that have raised questions about the validity of the result.
    

            Brazil, an important regional player, was softer in tone but said it was awaiting “the publication by the National Electoral Council of data broken down by polling station, an essential step for the transparency, credibility, and legitimacy of the election results,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
    

            The US on Monday joined Venezuelan civil society groups and the opposition by calling on Venezuela’s government to “immediately” release specific data on the presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s victory.
    

            Senior Biden administration officials on Monday said Venezuelan election authorities must release the “detailed precinct level results” from the election. One senior administration official noted that this data is required under Venezuela law and should be immediately available. Another said that if the election results are credible, “then this should be a very simple act and one that they would be able to fulfill quite easily.”
    

            “If there is resistance to providing that additional information, then I think that becomes highly problematic when it comes to the ability of the United States or other members of the international community to judge whether these elections were in fact inclusive and credible,” the second official said.
    

            “Our deepest concern at this juncture is that the analysis and data that we have about this election – which is independent from the National Electoral Council results – is at odds with the results as they were announced by the Venezuelan authorities. And so that discrepancy, in our view, needs to be investigated and addressed before we can close the books on this election,” the second official added.
    

            The officials declined to give specifics on the actions the US or international community would be prepared to take if the Venezuelan authorities do not release the data or if the results are determined to be fraudulent, but they did not rule out sanctions.
    

            US sanctions against Venezuela were first imposed in 2017 and gradually increased as the South American country’s political crisis deepened in the following years. The opposition’s accusations cast doubt on Venezuela’s return to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.
    

            The first official said they would begin to have conversations in forums like the Organization of American States (OAS) and the G7 about the “collective way forward.”

CNN_64,"Dozens of Russian mercenaries killed in rebel ambush in Mali, in their worst known loss in Africa",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/africa/russian-mercenaries-wagner-killed-mali-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-30 04:05:00,world,"
            The video is as triumphant as it is gruesome. Rebel fighters, rifles slung over their shoulders, step among more than a dozen bodies strewn across the sand and rocks. Off camera, the pop of gunshots can be heard.
    

            The scene is from another battle in the vast deserts of northern Mali – except that this time the victims were Russians. At the end of the video, the camera pans to a bearded white man on the ground, apparently begging for mercy.
    

            A different video shows several white men, still alive, kneeling amid the wreckage of a vehicle, as guerrilla fighters encircle them. A pickup truck with militants approaches the men, as others kick them in the head.
    

            The Russian mercenaries appear to have been attacked as they were accompanying Malian government troops on patrol last week near the Algerian border, a vast, forbidding region where jihadi and Tuareg groups have long been active.
    

            The attack was claimed by a Tuareg rebels group along with the al Qaeda affiliate in the Sahel, JNIM (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin). Known for ad hoc cooperation, they appear to have collaborated to trap the Russian convoy.
    

            JNIM claimed Sunday that a “complex ambush” had wiped out the convoy, killing 50 Russians and a number of Malian soldiers, and published videos showing several vehicles ablaze as well as dozens of bodies in the area. A Tuareg militant group spokesman said some Malian troops and Russian fighters had also been captured during the battle.

Putin says ‘fragments of hand grenades’ found in remains of dead on Wagner boss’s crashed plane


            According to some unofficial Russian Telegram channels, as many as 80 Russians were killed.
    

            That would make it by far the worst loss for Russian paramilitaries in several years of operating in Africa, as the Kremlin has sought to use proxy forces to challenge Western influence across the Sahel and central Africa and prop up unstable regimes.
    

            In an extraordinary twist Monday, a Ukrainian official claimed Kyiv had provided the militants with intelligence.
    

            Andriy Yusov, a representative of Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), said on Ukrainian television that “the rebels received necessary information, which enabled a successful military operation against Russian war criminals.”
    

            “We won’t discuss the details at the moment, but there will be more to come,” Yusov added.
    

            Channels associated with the Wagner group, a private military contractor active in Africa which is now part of what the Russian Defense Ministry calls the African Corps, said that at first its fighters had inflicted heavy losses on the militants.
    

            But the militants had regrouped and the command of Wagner “decided to transfer additional forces to the combat area.”
    

            In a battle lasting from Thursday through Saturday, the jihadis increased the number of massive attacks, “using heavy weapons, UAVs [drones] and suicide vehicles,” according to one Telegram account associated with Wagner.
    

            The Russian contingent’s last radio message – late Saturday – said: “There are three of us left, we continue to fight,” according to the channel.
    

            The commander, Sergei Shevchenko, was among those killed in battle, according to a second Wagner channel.
    

            Also among the dead, according to several Russian Telegram channels, was one of Russia’s most popular military bloggers, Nikita Fedyanin, whose Grey Zone channel has more than half-a-million subscribers.
    

            Fedyanin’s death cannot be independently verified, but a photograph from the scene closely resembled him. A long-time Wagner analyst told CNN that the Grey Zone channel has stopped being updated. “I think the story is true; he probably did die.”
    

            A former commander of the ambushed contingent said on Telegram that more than 80 men were killed and more than 15 had been captured. The commander – call-sign Rusich – said on Telegram he was trying to convey a message to the Russian Defense Ministry. “I am ready to provide myself and all those people who are ready to follow me absolutely free of charge, in order to save the guys.”

Who is the new Wagner leader in the Central African Republic? CNN investigates


            Another Wagner-linked social media account spoke of a “heavy unequal battle, as a result of which both our fighters and the Malian military heroically died.” It pledged that whoever the enemy, “world terrorism, the henchmen of Western countries or the enraged Ukrainian heresy… we know that the Russian warrior will definitely continue his journey.”
    

            There is no way to verify the exact number of Russian casualties (some Russian channels say the death toll was not as high as 80), nor how many Malian troops were killed. The Malian armed forces said Friday that only two soldiers had died but that clashes were taking place in a region that “remains a bastion of concentration of terrorists and smugglers of all stripes.”
    

            CNN is reaching out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Korotkov, who works with the London-based Dossier Center, noted that “not a single official body of the Russian Federation has spoken on this issue. Neither the Ministry of Defense, nor the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor the Kremlin commented on the deaths of dozens of Russian citizens in clashes on the African continent outside the special military operation zone.”
    

            Wagner and other Russian mercenary groups are accustomed to losses – in Syria, the Central African Republic, Mozambique and Mali over recent years. The Wagner PMC lost hundreds and probably thousands of men in taking the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut two years ago. And in Syria five years ago, a disastrous attack by Russian mercenaries on an oil refinery led to dozens of casualties.
    

            But beyond eastern Ukraine, Russian mercenaries have rarely suffered a setback on this scale.
    

            Amid upheavals in Mali, the Central African Republic, Niger and Burkina Faso, Russian elements with the backing of the Kremlin have stepped in to usurp traditional French influence, beginning in CAR in 2018. The military regime in Mali turned to Wagner soon after seizing power in 2021.
    

            After the death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in a mysterious plane crash near Moscow last year, many of his fighters were subsumed into a Russian African Corps directed by Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov.
    

            Yevkurov has been an occasional visitor to Mali and on its Telegram channel the African Corps said in January it planned to increase its strength in Mali from 100 to 300 men.
    

            The latest clashes also indicate that a coalition of militant groups is growing in strength, in Mali and beyond.
    

            There are constantly shifting alliances among rebel groups in the Sahel, but Tuareg groups have sometimes made common cause with al Qaeda’s affiliate in the region, JNIM.
    

            JNIM has claimed to have attacked Wagner contingents in Mali in the past. It has been especially active recently in both northern Mali and several parts of west Africa. In the last week alone, JNIM claimed five attacks in different regions of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist groups. One of them was an IED attack on a Russian vehicle in the same region of Mali as the latest devastating assault.
    

            In addition it carried out a rare attack on a military base in northern Togo last week, expanding its range of operations.
    

            But it’s the ambitious attack on the Russian-Malian convoy near the Algerian border that will catapult JNIM’s operations to a much broader audience.

CNN_66,"Biden calls for major Supreme Court reforms, including term limits, at Civil Rights Act event Monday",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/biden-supreme-court-reform/index.html,2024-07-30 05:55:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden called for major Supreme Court reforms Monday, a long-shot move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation’s highest court operates.
    

            Biden’s proposals — a constitutional amendment stripping the president of immunity for crimes committed while in office, term limits for Supreme Court justices, and a binding code of conduct for the high court — stand little chance of going anywhere with a divided Congress. But they serve as an election-year message designed to excite the Democrats’ progressive base. Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, quickly endorsed the proposed changes, which come at a time of deep unpopularity for the high court.

            Biden’s announcement, which he made at an event in Austin, Texas, commemorating the Civil Rights Act, follows this month’s monumental decision by the Supreme Court granting presidents full immunity for some actions taken while in office and after a tide of revelations about justices accepting vacations and gifts from wealthy conservative donors. Democrats on the campaign trail frequently point to the Supreme Court’s conservative majority – solidified by former President Donald Trump – to underscore what they see as the high stakes of the 2024 election.
    

            “In recent years, extreme opinions that the Supreme Court has handed down have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections,” Biden said Monday, listing a litany of recent cases, including the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and this month’s immunity decision.
    

            Biden is also calling for an amendment dubbed the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” which will state the Constitution “does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as President.”
    

            “I share our Founders’ belief that the president must answer to the law,” Biden said.
    

            In what would be another major change, Biden also called for term limits for Supreme Court justices, who serve lifetime appointments. That move, Biden said, would make the timing for the nomination process “more predictable and less arbitrary.”
    

            The reforms Biden is proposing would require congressional approval, which would be difficult to achieve before his term ends, as Republicans control the House and Democrats have a slim majority in the Senate. The constitutional amendment, meanwhile, would require a more complicated process involving the states that seems nearly impossible to succeed.
    

            The reforms, which will face heavy resistance, are meant to “restore trust and accountability when it comes to the presidency and the United States Supreme Court,” a White House official said.
    

            Ahead of Biden’s announcement, White House officials acknowledged the reform package faces an uphill battle, declining in a gaggle with reporters Monday to say whether Biden believes the proposal is “realistic.”
    

            Steve Benjamin, the White House director of public engagement, said the proposed reforms “will require some type of legislative action,” but he struck a hopeful tone that voters will be able to sway their representatives in Congress.
    

            CNN reported this month that Biden was seriously considering endorsing major Supreme Court reforms, actions that liberal lawmakers and groups have been pushing in recent years.

Analysis: Biden’s 41-year evolution on Supreme Court reform


            Biden’s proposals drew sharp and swift pushback from Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Johnson said the proposal would go nowhere in the House, assuming Republicans retain control of the chamber next year.
    

            “It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the court’s recent decisions,” Johnson said. “This dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris administration is dead on arrival in the House.”
    

            Biden, asked about Johnson’s assertion that the proposal would be dead on arrival in the House, responded after landing in Texas: “I think that’s what he is. Dead on arrival.”
    

            Pressed on how he’d pass the measures on Capitol Hill, Biden said, “We’re going to figure a way.”
    

            Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said “the Supreme Court is under attack” in a speech on the Senate floor Monday, calling for Biden and Harris to accept rulings from the court instead of responding “with a full schedule attack on the justices who ruled against them.”
    

            Leonard Leo, a conservative legal advocate whom Democrats accuse of playing a central role in some of the ethics controversies swirling around the court, also criticized the Biden administration proposals in a rare statement.
    

            “No conservative justice has made any decision in any big case that surprised anyone, so let’s stop pretending this is about undue influence,” Leo said. “It’s about Democrats destroying a court they don’t agree with.”
    

            Leo, board co-chairman of the influential Federalist Society, was subpoenaed by Senate Democrats in April. The Senate Judiciary Committee is seeking to better understand whether specific individuals and groups have used undisclosed gifts to gain access to the justices. Leo called the subpoena “unlawful” and “politically motivated” and told CNN at the time that he was “not capitulating” to that request.
    

            Others praised the administration’s ideas.
    

            Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee who has proposed legislation to tighten ethics rules at the court, described the Biden announcement as a “strong” proposal.
    

            “This court has proven time after time that it cannot police itself,” he said.
    

            Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin acknowledged that there is only a “remote possibility” that the chamber could pass court ethics legislation, but noted that they are “urging” Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring up Whitehouse’s bill before the end of the year.
    

            The Monday announcement comes more than three years after Biden created a commission to study structural changes at the Supreme Court, including term limits and proposals to increase the number of justices. The group submitted its report to the White House in late 2021, but the administration did not pursue any of the ideas discussed in the document.
    

            The debate over proposed structural changes at the Supreme Court has become deeply partisan, with Republicans widely opposed. But the issue has drawn renewed attention after it was reported in May that controversial flags were previously hoisted on properties owned by conservative Justice Samuel Alito. Both of the flags were flown by rioters during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, though Alito has denied any connection to that incident and has said his wife hoisted them for different reasons – including a spat with neighbors.
    

            Meanwhile, the court handed down several controversial decisions this summer that drew sharp criticism on the left, including the stunning 6-3 ruling that granted Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Justice Elena Kagan says Supreme Court’s code of conduct needs an enforcement plan


            Last year, the high court adopted its own code of conduct. But the measure was heavily criticized by ethics experts because it included no way to enforce its requirements. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan defended the code of conduct in remarks last week but also conceded it would be more effective if it included an enforcement mechanism.
    

            Biden’s proposal comes as polling indicates support for the court is hovering near historic lows. A Marquette Law School poll in May found that 61% of Americans disapprove of the job the court is doing. Just four years ago, the same poll found the court had a 66% approval rating.
    

            Democrats have sought to use public disapproval of the court – particularly its 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade – to drive voters. Biden and Harris have made that decision a central part of their campaign arguments, hoping the issue of abortion rights will galvanize voters heading into November.
    

            Harris endorsed the proposed changes in a statement released by her campaign Monday, saying they would “restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law.”
    

            She also said there was a “clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.”
    

            “In the course of our Nation’s history, trust in the Supreme Court of the United States has been critical to achieving equal justice under law,” Harris wrote. “President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must have confidence in the Supreme Court. Yet today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent.”
    

            White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday that Harris was closely involved in the proposal.
    

            “The president consulted her closely,” Jean-Pierre said. “Let’s not forget that she was a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as a former attorney general, so he certainly listened to her expertise in this arena as well.”
    

            Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who has resisted calls from his party to expand the court, has become increasingly critical of its makeup. He has described the Supreme Court as “out of kilter” and has warned of the impact a second Trump presidency could have on the nation’s highest court.
    

            Biden, who is making his first trip since bowing out of the 2024 race, called for the changes at the presidential library honoring President Lyndon B. Johnson, who ended his own reelection bid in 1968. Biden also used his remarks to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the landmark legislation that cemented Johnson’s legacy.

            It’s funny, really. In an election where the two leading presidential candidates are miles apart on weighty issues from abortion rights to border policy, for some reason both sides are talking about how Vice President Kamala Harris laughs and former President Donald Trump doesn’t.
    

            Trump, trying out new material to mock Harris, has dubbed his opponent as “Laffin’ Kamala.”
    

            “She’s crazy. She’s nuts,” he said at a recent rally in Michigan, implying there is something maniacal about her laugh.

Right-wing media figures target Kamala Harris with race and gender-based attacks


            His supporters might hear a funny joke, but hers hear a sexist attack in line with the resurfaced comments of JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, who described childless Democrats in a 2021 interview as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.”
    

            If you don’t hear any sexism in any of this, consider that Trump also mocked Hillary Clinton for her laughter.
    

            Democrats, meanwhile, are trying a new tactic to deal with Trump’s most outrageous claims – laughing at them to take their power away.
    

            Allies of Harris are shifting gears to emphasize not the danger they think Trump poses to the country but instead how “weird” he sounds when he makes outlandish claims.
    

            “Listen to the guy,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” of Trump. “He’s talking about Hannibal Lecter, and shocking sharks, and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind. And I thought we just give him way too much credit.”
    

            Calling Trump and Vance “weird” helps “ratchet down some of the scariness,” Walz, a potential vice presidential pick, said. He went on to add that Trump is rarely seen laughing.
    

            “If he has laughed, it’s at someone, not with someone. That is weird behavior. And I don’t think you call it anything else. It’s simply what we’re observing,” Walz said.
    

            It is certainly true that Trump rarely laughs. CNN’s Gregory Krieg wrote about it in 2016. The magician/comedian Penn Jillette, who spent time with Trump during “The Apprentice” years, has talked about how Trump does not laugh. And so has former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump controversially fired back in 2017.
    

            While Trump himself rarely laughs, his supporters often dismiss his more controversial statements as jokes.
    

            For instance, look at when he told a gathering of conservative Christians on Friday that if they vote for him in November, they won’t have to vote again in four years because “it’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine.” What’ll be fixed? The next election? Division in the country? We don’t know.
    

Tapper asked Sen. Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, how he interpreted Trump’s baffling remark.
    

            “I think he’s obviously making a joke,” Cotton said.
    

            That’s a recurring theme among Trump supporters – that outrageous claims are clearly jokes. No, Trump doesn’t really want to be “dictator” for a day, it’s just a joke he said with a straight face, they’ll argue, adding that people who don’t get the jokes need to stop taking things so seriously.
    

            Jokes don’t require laughter, obviously, but laughter certainly helps people know when you’re joking.
    

            Trump’s niece Mary, who is no fan of her uncle, has said Trump gets his intentionally straight face from his father, her grandfather, who “also didn’t laugh.”
    

            “Laughing is to make yourself vulnerable, it’s to let down your guard in some way, it’s to lose a little bit of control,” Mary Trump told Virginia Heffernan of Slate in 2020. “And that can’t happen. That is not allowed to happen.”
    

            While Democrats are using Trump’s lack of laughing as evidence of his larger “weirdness,” Republicans hope that sharing clips of Harris belly laughing will make her seem “weird” to the people who don’t yet have much of an impression of her. It’s a tactic that so far seems to have backfired, since Harris supporters also like to share clips of her laughing.
    

            She’ll laugh at herself in the midst of a speech, like the viral “coconut tree” moment that has gotten so much attention. She’ll laugh in the midst of a press conference or during a “60 Minutes” interview – otherwise serious moments when another politician might try to keep a straight face throughout.
    

            Harris likes to bring up the subject of her laughter, as she did with Drew Barrymore a few months ago.
    

            “Apparently some people love to talk about the way I laugh,” Harris said.
    

            “I have my mother’s laugh. And I grew up around a bunch of women in particular, who laughed from the belly. … They would sit around the kitchen and drinking their coffee, telling big stories with big laughs.”
    

            Harris said she’s not going to tone down her laughter because it’s important to remind each other and teach younger people a lesson.
    

            “Don’t be confined to other people’s perception about what this looks like, and how you should act in order to be,” she said.

CNN_68,Judge declines to appoint monitor for NRA but bars former CEO Wayne LaPierre from working for group,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/nra-civil-trial-wayne-lapierre/index.html,2024-07-30 05:40:00,us,"
            A New York judge on Monday banned Wayne LaPierre, the former head of the National Rifle Association, from holding a paid position with the organization for a decade, but he declined to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the gun rights group’s finances.
    

            The split decision from Judge Joel Cohen came on the final day of arguments in the second stage of the civil trial of the NRA brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    

            Ruling from the bench, Cohen said the state’s request for a monitor was not the correct remedy, suggesting the outside oversight mechanism would be “time-consuming, disruptive and will impose significant costs on the NRA without corresponding benefits.”
    

            Cohen also said he had concerns about “speech-chilling government intrusion on the affairs of the organization.”
    

            He said the same First Amendment concerns did not apply to whether LaPierre could serve anytime soon in the organization.
    

            “This relief is about the privilege, not the right, to serve as an officer or director of a New York not-for-profit,” he said.
    

            Earlier Monday, LaPierre, told the judge that appointing a monitor to oversee the gun rights group’s finances would be “equivalent to putting a knife straight through the heart of the organization and twisting it.”
    

            He described the appointment of a monitor as an existential threat to the group because it would send a message to prospective members and donors that the NRA was “being surveilled by this attorney general in New York.”
    

            If the monitor is appointed, he said, “General James will have achieved her objective to fulfill that campaign promise of, in effect, dissolving the NRA for a lack of money and a lack of members.”
    

            Following the trial’s first phase earlier this year, a jury found LaPierre and another deputy liable for misspending millions of dollars on personal expenses. James was seeking an independent monitor to oversee the group’s finances and compliance with whistle-blower policies. She was also seeking to bar LaPierre, the organization’s mouthpiece for decades, from returning to the NRA.
    

            It’s unclear what effect, if any, the 10-year ban on LaPierre serving with the NRA might have.
    

            In her closing statements, NRA attorney Sarah Rogers said the group had no plans to rehire LaPierre, even as she described him as a “visionary leader who commanded a lot of respect and deference.”
    

            She said the group has implemented strong internal controls that made the appointment of a monitor unnecessary.
    

            LaPierre served as the group’s CEO and executive vice president for more than three decades. He resigned in January on the eve of the first phase of the trial.
    

            Those proceedings cast a spotlight on the leadership, culture and financing of the organization, with state lawyers accusing LaPierre of siphoning millions of dollars from the organization to fund his lavish lifestyle, including trips on private jets and other personal gifts.
    

            The jury ordered LaPierre to repay almost $4.4 million to the organization, while the NRA’s retired finance chief, Wilson “Woody” Phillips, was ordered to pay back $2 million.
    

            The second phase of the proceeding was a bench trial, meaning there was no jury and the judge handed down the verdict.
    

            Earlier this month, Jeffrey Tenenbaum, a lawyer testifying for the state as an expert in nonprofit law, said the NRA had made some strides toward transparency but could backslide without the appointment of an independent monitor. He described the organization’s policy manual as “a dumpster fire.”
    

            State attorneys noted that LaPierre hadn’t been reprimanded by the organization. Although the NRA has touted a change a leadership, several LaPierre loyalists remain in its upper echelons. The NRA has lost more than 1.3 million members since 2018, according to an expert witness called by the group.
    

            James sued the NRA and its executives in 2020 under her authority to investigate not-for-profits registered in the state. She originally sought to have the entire organization dissolved, but the judge ruled in 2022 that the allegations did not warrant a “corporate death penalty.”

CNN_70,‘Biohazard’ prompts United Airlines flight diversion,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/travel/united-airlines-biohazard-diversion/index.html,2024-07-30 05:17:00,world,"
            A “biohazard” on a United Airlines flight is the latest midair incident to trigger an unplanned, early landing of a commercial plane.
    

            United Airlines says one passenger’s “medical issue” caused flight 2477 to land in Virginia, where the plane had to be “deep cleaned.” FlightAware shows the flight departing Houston on Sunday morning, then diverting to Washington Dulles International Airport about two hours into the trip. The flight was bound for Boston Logan International Airport.
    

Audio posted on X by Thenewarea51 captured a flight crew member describing a “biohazard” on board the flight.
    

            “It sounds like it’s quite bad back there,” the recording captured. “The crew is vomiting and passengers all around are asking for masks.”
    

            In a statement, United says “we deep cleaned the aircraft and it departed for Boston later that afternoon.”
    

            This is the latest gross incident on board a commercial flight.
    

            Earlier this month, a Delta flight diverted to New York when spoiled food made passengers sick. In April, a United flight had to return to San Francisco when a toilet began overflowing.

CNN_71,"Text messages, radio chatter show confused communications around tracking Trump’s would-be assassin",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/trump-shooting-text-messages/index.html,2024-07-30 06:54:00,politics,"
            Text messages and radio chatter released Monday show that law enforcement officers lost sight of Donald Trump’s would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, and further illustrate the confused communications around tracking him at the July 13 rally.
    

            According to documents released by Sen. Chuck Grassley’s office, law enforcement officers knew of and raised the shooter’s presence at the rally more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof and fired eight rounds at Trump.
    

            At 5:14 p.m, an officer took photos of Crooks sitting outside. Twenty minutes later he sent those images to a group chat, the texts show.
    

            “Kid learning around building we are in,” one text reads. “I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.”
    

            Messages show that 10 minutes later, an officer sends the images to a second group chat and tells the other members to forward it: “if you wanna send this to whoever at command.” Six minutes later, at 5:51 p.m., someone responds: “Sent.”
    

            One of the members of that same group chat also said they had lost track of where the shooter had gone just 15 minutes before the shooting.
    

            “They are asking for a direction of travel,” one person wrote at 5:59 p.m., referring to the command center.
    

            Someone responded  a minute later: “Not sure. He was up against the building. If I had to guess towards the back. Away from the event.”
    

            Grassley’s office also released the Beaver County ESU after-action report that contained redacted entries on a timeline that appear to detail the flow of information in the crucial minutes after a local officer first saw a young man later identified as Crooks with a range finder.
    

            The redacted entries reveal the communications as the information is passed up the chain.

CNN_72,"Fact check: Vance falsely claims Harris is calling to end the child tax credit, which she is actually calling to increase",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/politics/fact-check-vance-false-harris-child-tax-credit/index.html,2024-07-30 06:35:00,politics,"
            Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance is facing criticism over his previous comments about people without children, including one 2021 remark denouncing “childless cat ladies” in government and another in which he said that, in order to “tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good,” people without children should pay a higher tax rate than people with children.
    

            Vance is now trying to turn the tables on the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, Vance said, “I think a lot of parents and a lot of non-parents look at our public policy over the last four years and ask, ‘How did we get to this place? How did we get to a place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?’”
    

Facts First: Vance’s claim that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit is false. In fact, it is the opposite of reality: Harris has called for years to increase the child tax credit. As vice president, she has advocated for the permanent adoption of the enhanced child tax credit that was temporarily in effect in 2021 under a pandemic relief law – a law that was signed by President Joe Biden after it was passed by Congress with only Democratic support.


            Spokespeople for Vance and the Trump-Vance campaign did not immediately respond to CNN’s Monday requests to offer any substantiation for Vance’s claim. But a Vance spokesperson, William Martin, argued to ABC News last week that “the policy Senator Vance proposed is basically no different than the Child Tax Credit, which Democrats unanimously support.”
    

            That’s a far more debatable assertion than Vance’s own claim on Fox News that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit, which is just wrong. Erica York, senior economist and research director at The Tax Foundation think tank, said in a Monday email that Vance’s claim is “false.”
    

            “VP Harris has not called to end the child tax credit, has regularly highlighted the significant expansion of the credit the Biden-Harris administration oversaw during the pandemic, and has a history of supporting expansions to the credit,” York said.
    

            Vance prefaced his 2021 comments about tax policy and children by speaking of his desire to use policy to “reward the things that we think are good” and “punish the things that we think are bad.”
    

            York noted that the “ultimate effect” of the child tax credit is that people with children have lower tax rates than people without children, but she said Vance “misleadingly” equated the Harris campaign’s criticism of his 2021 comments with opposition to the existence of the child tax credit.
    

            Vance’s claim on Fox News was not a one-time slip. He made a similar comment last week in an interview with conservative host Megyn Kelly, saying, “Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning, Megyn, and saying that we should not have the child tax credit?” The Harris campaign has not said that.
    

            Harris’ support for an expanded child tax credit predates her vice presidency. In 2018, as a US senator for California, Harris co-sponsored a Democratic bill to increase the credit. She co-sponsored another version of that expansion bill in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary.
    

            As vice president, Harris has made numerous comments in support of returning to the enhanced child tax credit that was authorized as a one-year temporary measure by Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan pandemic relief law.
    

            The temporary expansion – which increased the maximum amount of the credit, made the credit fully refundable so the lowest-income families could qualify and sent out half of the credit in monthly payments – was a major contributor to a steep decline in child poverty in 2021. Child poverty then spiked in 2022, roughly to pre-pandemic levels, after Congress allowed the expanded credit to expire against the wishes of Biden and Harris.
    

            A bipartisan House bill that would expand the child tax credit again has stalled in the Senate this year amid Republican opposition.
    

            Harris posted on social media in March: “President Biden and I cut child poverty nearly in half after expanding the Child Tax Credit for millions of working families. It’s time for Congress to restore the full expanded Child Tax Credit.” She posted in March 2023: “The expanded Child Tax Credit cut the child poverty rate nearly in half during the first year of our Administration. Our budget restores this tax credit permanently because we believe it is our duty to invest in our nation’s children.”
    

            She has also talked up the 2021 expansion of the child tax credit on the campaign trail in recent weeks.
    

            In a July 18 speech before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, she said, “Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires, we gave tax cuts to families through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in America by half.” She touted the expansion again in a speech to a historically Black sorority after Biden dropped out, saying, “We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, which is why I helped pass the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half and cut Black child poverty even more.”

CNN_73,Protests erupt in Venezuela as questions grow over strongman Maduro’s victory,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/29/americas/venezuela-election-results-maduro-opposition-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-30 07:01:00,world,"
            Protests broke out in several Venezuelan cities on Monday after authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro was formally declared a winner by the county’s electoral authority in a presidential race marred by accusations of electoral fraud.
    

            In the capital of Caracas, security forces deployed tear gas to disperse a large crowd of protesters, while crowds of people were seen walking down a main road banging pots and pans as anger rose over Maduro’s victory on Sunday. PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights organization, said pro-Maduro armed groups shot at peaceful demonstrators in Avenue Urdaneta.
    

            Protests were also reported in other cities, including Maracay, where opposition activist Esthefania Natera told CNN that people were on the streets “to yell and demand to tell the truth because we know the real results.” In the coastal state of Falcón, demonstrators toppled a statue of Maduro, video on social media showed.
    

            The next 24 hours will be key in seeing how Maduro responds to the allegations against him. Analysts say there could be a new wave of unrest in the country if there are widespread protests against the regime. Street demonstrations in previous years were crushed by the country’s military, which has long supported Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.
    

            Maduro smiled as he entered the National Electoral Council (CNE) before a Monday ceremony at which he was declared the winner, receiving cheers and congratulations from many in the audience. The CNE, which is stacked with Maduro allies, has yet to issue final vote tallies from Sunday’s election.
    

            “Venezuela has the best electoral system in the world!” CNE president Elvis Amoroso announced before proceeding with the formal announcement.
    

            But the vote was riddled with claims of irregularities. It included opposition witnesses being denied access to the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters as votes were counted and the electoral authority allegedly prevented more votes from being processed. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.

            The US on Monday joined Venezuelan civil society groups and the opposition by calling on Venezuela’s government to “immediately” release specific data on the presidential election, citing concerns about the credibility of Maduro’s victory.
    

            Maduro’s government controls almost all state institutions, including the CNE, which was accused in 2017 of manipulating turnout figures by a software company that provided the voting technology. The CNE previously denied the assertion.
    

            The opposition coalition, headed by Maria Corina Machado, earlier rejected Maduro’s win, saying the opposition’s records show that opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez received 70% of the votes against Maduro’s 30%. “We won, and everyone knows it,” Machado said. The coalition plans on making a statement later on Monday.
    

            Machado is part of a unified opposition movement that overcame their divisions to form a coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. Its energized campaign, which enjoyed strong polling figures prior to Sunday’s vote, was seen as the biggest challenge to Maduro’s rule.
    

            The United States is among regional leaders, including Peru and Chile, that have raised questions about the validity of the result.
    

            Brazil, an important regional player, was softer in tone but said it was awaiting “the publication by the National Electoral Council of data broken down by polling station, an essential step for the transparency, credibility, and legitimacy of the election results,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
    

            Venezuela’s government, in turn, said it was expelling diplomatic staff from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Uruguay, calling them “right-wing Washington-subordinate governments” who were committed to “the most sordid fascist ideological positions.”
    

            Only a very limited number of election observers were allowed to monitor the vote. These included The Carter Center and the United Nations, which also called on the country’s election commission (CNE) to publish polling station-level results.
    

            “The Carter Center has a big responsibility on their shoulders,” Laura Cristina Dib, the Venezuela Program director at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), told CNN, explaining that it is the only international technical observation mission that can issue a public report on the results. It is unclear when it will be issued.
    

            Senior Biden administration officials said Venezuelan election authorities must release the “detailed precinct-level results” from the election. One senior administration official noted that this data is required under Venezuela law and should be immediately available. Another said that if the election results are credible, “then this should be a very simple act and one that they would be able to fulfill quite easily.”

            The officials declined to give specifics on the actions the US or international community would be prepared to take if the Venezuelan authorities do not release the data or if the results are determined to be fraudulent, but they did not rule out sanctions.
    

            US sanctions against Venezuela were first imposed in 2017 and gradually increased as the South American country’s political crisis deepened in the following years.
    

            The opposition’s accusations cast doubt on Venezuela’s return to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.
    

            The vote’s outcome is expected to be felt across the Americas – including the US – in the form of migration.
    

            Under Maduro’s watch, up to 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country amid unprecedented levels of poverty and economic mismanagement – thousands of whom have trekked north to the US’s southern border. If Maduro remains in power, one poll conducted in June estimates up to a third of the population is considering leaving the country after the election.
    

            According to Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, such a situation “could be a really bad October surprise for the Democrats” in the upcoming US presidential election.
    

            If Maduro is inaugurated next January, it would be his third consecutive six-year term and the continuation of “Chavismo,” the left-wing populist ideology named after Chávez.
    

            Chávez ruled Venezuela for 14 years until his death in 2013. His policies were dominated by nationalization and the redistribution of the nation’s huge oil wealth to the marginalized and poorest communities, as well as a constant push to protect Venezuelan sovereignty against “imperialist” powers.
    

            But the oil-rich nation has in the past few years experienced the world’s worst peacetime economic crash in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime on the downturn, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”
    

            A loss in the election could have devastating consequences for Maduro, who is facing drug trafficking and corruption charges in the US and is under investigation for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. If he was to relinquish control, he could end up in prison.

WaPo_1,"For fencer Lauren Scruggs, an Olympic silver and a piece of history",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/lee-kiefer-lauren-scruggs-fencing-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 08:00:02.926980,,"PARIS — If his life had not made other plans, Peter Westbrook would have been here Sunday inside Grand Palais. He would have watched Lauren Scruggs, a young woman he loves, fence under the nave and glass ceiling and make the kind of history he once did.Westbrook has stage-four liver cancer, so he cannot be around crowds. The first Black man from the United States to win an Olympic fencing medal stayed home. He watched on television with his wife as Scruggs — 40 years after his achievement — became the first Black woman from the United States to win an Olympic fencing medal.Westbrook’s condition comes with doctor’s orders: He is not supposed to move in a way that jostles his liver. That would not stop him.“Hell, no,” Westbrook said by phone Sunday night, chuckling at the question. “I did jumping jacks.”A rising senior at Harvard from Queens, Scruggs won the silver medal in the women’s foil at the Paris Olympics. After her semifinal victory clinched a medal, Scruggs covered her face with her right arm, one of the few moments of stillness all day. She fenced with audacity and performed with sheer confidence, setting the terms against bigger, more experienced opponents, screaming after points and exhorting family members in the crowd.Scruggs lost only to fellow American Lee Kiefer, who defended her gold medal from Tokyo with a 15-6 victory in the final. Before Kiefer claimed gold at the Tokyo Olympics, the United States had never won an individual medal in the women's foil. Sunday, Americans took gold and silver. Kiefer became the second American woman after Mariel Zagunis to win two fencing golds.Scruggs made the kind of history that could have lasting impact. Westbrook recalled more Black men entering the sport after he won his bronze medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. He sees the same effect coming after Scruggs’s triumph. “They tried fencing because of me,” Westbrook said. “They’re going to try fencing because of Lauren.”“Fencing has largely certainly been a non-Black sport,” Scruggs said. “I hope that people who look like me, girls who look like me, feel they have a place in this sport.”Scruggs started fencing at about age 7. Her brother, Nolen, loved “Star Wars” as a kid and viewed fencing as his way to duel with a lightsaber. Their mother spotted an ad for a local club and signed him up. Nolen wanted to quit after a few lessons, but their mother already had paid for the equipment and wouldn’t allow it. Scruggs kept tagging along.Scruggs realized she was good right away. Today, she views the barriers to expanding the pool of fencers as both financial and cultural. It is an expensive sport associated with prep schools and the Ivy League. Black kids who sign up at a club may not see people who look like them.“From a young age, I really had to prove myself to get respect,” Scruggs said. “It’s the little things. Maybe no one’s cheering for you, things like that.”As she won tournaments, her stepdad, who is White, contacted Westbrook through her coach, Sean McClain. In Westbrook’s recollection, Scruggs’s stepfather wanted Westbrook to provide a Black male influence for her.Westbrook accepted Scruggs into the Peter Westbrook Foundation, which Westbrook started in 1991 to support and mentor underrepresented youth through fencing. More than 4,000 kids have come through the program, which touts a 100-percent graduation rate. Scruggs still returns every Saturday when she is home from Harvard to volunteer and coach. When she walked onto the piste Sunday morning, Scruggs became the 17th Olympian produced by Westbrook’s foundation.Through Scruggs was an Olympic rookie, she arrived with a full resume. She won the 2020 junior world championship and the 2023 NCAA championship. She has made all-American all three years of her college career and entered the Olympics ranked 11th in the world.Just 21, Scruggs refused to back down. She attacked every match, every point with confidence derived from growing up in New York City. She locked in before bouts by blasting music in her headphones. She danced across the piste in bright red shoes. During one timeout, she sipped a bottle of Coca Cola — “sugar and caffeine,” she said.In the round of 16, Scruggs beat Canadian Jessica Guo, the Harvard teammate who beat her in the NCAA title match this year. After she won, Scruggs slashed the air with her weapon, then pressed her face into a television camera on the corner of the piste and screamed into the lens. In her boldness, Scruggs carried Westbrook’s presence to Paris.“A lot of the energy you saw tonight is the energy he tells us to bring at the tournaments,” Scruggs said. “He’s a very energetic guy. A lot of charisma and machismo. So I brought that energy today. I was thinking him about him while I was fencing.”For a moment, it appeared Scruggs had been eliminated. In a heart-racing quarterfinal, Scruggs seized an 8-2 lead over world No. 2 Arianna Errigo of Italy, then watched it wither to 14-14. The next point would win. Scruggs and Errigo lunged at one another, and as is constantly the case in fencing, it was unclear who struck first. The judge awarded Errigo the match.Scruggs pulled off her mask and pointed at the replay screen on an end wall, certain the attack had been hers. Errigo celebrated, equally certain. Judges reviewed the point. The head referee brought the fencers to the center and notified them they had reversed the call. Errigo dropped to her knees and shrieked at the judges. Scruggs dropped her mask and raised her foil, pacing toward the far corner where her family was sitting.The victory pushed Scruggs to an epic stage. When introduced during the medal rounds, fencers emerged from behind an arched wooden door, waved their weapons from a gilded balcony and traipsed 50 steps down a curved staircase made of stone. They walked through a tunnel to a piste under a spotlight, 150 feet beneath the great glass dome. When a fencer scored, neon lights on their side of the floor glowed.In the semifinal, Scruggs dominated Canadian Eleanor Harvey. After fencing to a 5-5 tie, Scruggs won seven straight points and won, 15-9. Scruggs pulled off her mask. She had clinched a medal, one that one man understood more than anyone else could.“When you do something like that, man, there’s so many layers,” Westbrook said. “You do it for your country. You do it for your sport. You do it for Black people. You’re uplifting so many different levels.”At the medal ceremony, Scruggs stood on the podium and placed her right hand over her heart. She stared at the American flag as the “Star-Spangled Banner” played. She had won a medal that may inspire people who look like her to follow. She had uplifted a sick man she knows well and loves very much.“Oh, my gosh,” Westbrook said from back in New York. “I’m just so proud.”"
WaPo_2,"DJ Herz feels a breeze, but Nats fall short of a sweep in St. Louis",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/28/dj-herz-nationals-cardinals/,2024-07-29 08:00:02.926980,,"ST. LOUIS — DJ Herz doesn’t have elite velocity. His fastball averages a little under 94 mph — good enough to get him to the major leagues but unlikely to wow anyone with a radar gun these days.Yet that’s what made his outing in the Washington Nationals’ 4-3 loss Sunday afternoon at Busch Stadium all the more impressive. Many of the St. Louis Cardinals’ swings made it appear Herz was throwing 100. No matter how many times he attacked with his fastball, the Cardinals almost always were a tad late.Herz struck out eight in five innings and was in line to earn the win after James Wood tripled and former Cardinal Juan Yepez drove him in with a sacrifice fly to break a 2-2 tie in the sixth. But the Cardinals responded with a run in the seventh before Paul Goldschmidt slugged a walk-off homer against Dylan Floro, who hadn’t allowed a home run since September, in the ninth.“A hitter like Goldschmidt, I’ve faced him quite a few times,” said Floro, whose 2-2 sinker got too much of the plate. “He kind of knows, has an idea, and when I don’t execute a pitch, that’s what’s going to happen.”Floro entered in the seventh but threw just 10 pitches before the ninth, so Manager Dave Martinez stuck with him instead of going with closer Kyle Finnegan. The loss denied the Nationals (49-57) a sweep of the Cardinals (54-51), but they still won the series after getting swept by San Diego at home. And they got a strong performance from their rookie left-hander, who has allowed two runs in each of his two outings since the all-star break.“[Herz] didn’t rely on his off-speed stuff,” Martinez said. “He got ahead and stayed with the fastball, which was good. Our [scouting] reports were to try to get the ball up on some of these guys, and he did a great job, especially those lefties. … He was very, very effective.”In the first inning, Herz allowed a second-deck solo homer to Willson Contreras. Pedro Pagés followed with an RBI triple in the second to extend the Cardinals’ lead to 2-0. The Nationals answered in the third when CJ Abrams hit an RBI groundout before Lane Thomas laced a double down the left field line to even the score. By that time, Herz noticed his fastball had extra life on it.“I could feel it out of the hand. I could see it,” he said. “... I told [catcher Riley Adams], and then we kind of rode with it. Pretty much majority fastball, and when we needed to flip in an off-speed or a change-up, we did.”Entering Sunday, Herz had induced whiffs on 32.1 percent of swings at his fastball, a very strong mark. But he was better than usual Sunday: Of the 79 pitches Herz threw, 49 were fastballs. The Cardinals swung at 27 of the fastballs and whiffed on 15. Six of his strikeouts came on the pitch.Herz seemed to get better as his outing rolled along — he struck out the side in the third and fifth innings and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced. His change-up — typically his best pitch — and his slider were effective, too. He finished his outing by striking out Masyn Winn with a slider.The Nationals optioned out Herz ahead of the all-star break to get extra bullpen help — and to give him a breather. He threw 111⅓ innings a season ago, including a stint in the Arizona Fall League. After Sunday, he is up to 80⅔ this season.As the Nationals head down the stretch, Martinez has reiterated that his team will be careful with its young pitchers while also pushing them to pitch the whole year. He has hinted at a six-man rotation. He said he’s limiting Herz to 80 pitches (or five innings) as he builds him up after the all-star break. But Herz will have every opportunity to prove he’s worthy of being in the rotation beyond this season.“I’m getting ahead. I’m attacking. I’m being efficient,” he said. “That’s all the things I want to see for myself, and that’s their main goals for me. ”On Sunday morning, the Nationals announced they acquired right-hander Tyler Stuart from the New York Mets for outfielder Jesse Winker. Stuart, 24, has spent this season with the Mets’ Class AA affiliate and has a 3.96 ERA in 17 starts.The Mets selected him in the sixth round of the 2022 draft out of Southern Mississippi, where he primarily was a reliever. As a pro, he has made 41 appearances — 40 of them starts — with a 3.09 ERA. Stuart, who stands 6-foot-9, uses a fastball, slider, change-up and cutter. His slider is considered his best pitch."
WaPo_3,Autistic child found dead in Maryland pond after 26-hour search,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/28/missing-autistic-child-gaithersburg-fawzan-hassan/,2024-07-29 08:18:02.926980,,"Six-year-old Fawzan Hassan and his family arrived at a Montgomery County park Saturday afternoon for a community event. The 3-foot-tall youngster, who is nonverbal, autistic and loves to climb, hit the playground.“His family looked to the playground,” an assistant police chief said, “and no longer saw him there.”A day later, after frantic searching by police officers, firefighters, volunteers and family members, the worst outcome arrived at 5:25 p.m. Sunday. The body of a child surfaced on a nearby pond. Police soon confirmed the death and  said it was Fawzan.“Our hearts go out to the family,” said Shiera Goff, a Montgomery County Police spokeswoman, speaking Sunday evening after police had led a 26-hour search of the area. “We all had been hoping for a different outcome.”Lt. Kristina Hedgepeth, in response to a question of what she would tell parents, said watching children is always difficult, and only more so when children have special needs.“It’s a tough thing to say to anyone in this situation,” Hedgepeth said, “but I just know as a parent myself, your head’s got to be on a swivel. You have to constantly be watching. And it’s even harder when you have a child with special needs.”More than 100 police officers, firefighters and volunteers had spent more than a day searching in and around Bohrer Park in Gaithersburg. Officials who called a news conference earlier Sunday  struck a confident tone.“We are committed to locating Fawzan and locating him safety,” Montgomery County Assistant Police Chief Nicholas Augustine said Sunday, appealing for help from the public as the search was extended outward from the park.“He could be hunkered down and just scared,” said Montgomery County police officer Laurie Reyes, who specializes in working with families of autistic children and helping find them when they go missing.Fawzan, who weighed 42 pounds, had last been last seen wearing a green shirt, blue jeans, and white and silver sneakers.Bohrer Park is bordered by neighborhoods on the southwest and southeast sides; by Frederick Avenue on the northeast side; and by Gaithersburg High School on the northwest side.Police had urged residents in the area to diligently search their property, including under porches and decks, and inside unlocked cars and sheds.Officers warned people not to approach the child because he might run away but to instead call 911.People with autism who go missing often are drawn to bodies of water, Reyes said. The Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service searched ponds in the area on Saturday and Sunday, said Pete Piringer, an agency spokesman.Officers with the Montgomery County Police Department, Gaithersburg Police Department, Maryland State Police and Maryland-National Capital Park Police had helped in the search, officials said. Drones with infrared sensing technology were flown over the area into the night.Police had encouraged residents to print out a flier from the department’s social media pages and hang it up in the Gaithersburg area.  Those driving in the area were asked to call police if they saw a young child sitting alone at a bus stop.Montgomery police offer this advice when approaching nonverbal autistic children:It is important to approach them calmly and slowly; avoid making sudden movements or loud noises that might startle them. Speak in a gentle, reassuring tone, even if the child does not respond verbally. Nonverbal autistic children might not respond to their name, so try to use other cues, such as visual signals or familiar objects, to get their attention.Most importantly, police said, ensure the child’s safety and wait for law enforcement to arrive.Advice to keep vulnerable people from wandering is available from the Montgomery Police Department’s Autism/Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD), Alzheimer’s and Dementia Outreach Unit."
WaPo_4,"Leon Marchand lands gold, an Olympic record and France’s collective heart",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/leon-marchand-400-individual-medley-gold-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 08:00:02.926980,,"NANTERRE, France — If you somehow could harness the energy pulsing through Paris La Défense Arena during the breaststroke leg of the men’s 400-meter individual medley final Sunday night — two lengths of the pool spanning a little more than a minute, some 15,000 fans on their feet, voices joined in a deafening and rhythmic sing-shout (“Allez! Allez!”) each time Leon Marchand’s swim-capped head bobbed up out of the water — it could power the rest of these 2024 Olympics, if not the rest of mankind’s stay on this beautiful, blue planet.Rarely has the combination of a transcendent athlete, a home-country setting, a global television audience and a runaway train of hype converged in one breathless moment — and then that moment met by an atmosphere and a performance that somehow exceeded its colossal buildup.Such was the effect of the tour de force unleashed Sunday night by Marchand, a 22-year-old from Toulouse, in the 400 IM — a race that is supposed to be the toughest in swimming but he made appear somehow easy.Marchand’s time of 4 minutes 2.95 seconds was good enough to win the race by 5.67 seconds — the largest margin of victory in history in this event — and broke the Olympic record set by Michael Phelps in Beijing in 2008. Only in the last 50 meters did he slip below his own world record pace from a year ago, when he announced his arrival as an international force by shattering Phelps’s 2009 world standard.“I was trying to focus on myself, but it’s really hard when 15,000 people are cheering for me,” Marchand said. “I did well in trying to use this energy to swim as fast as possible. I was trying to … go for it from the very beginning. The freestyle was a little tough at the end, but 4:02 is amazing, so I’m really amazed by today.”From the point Marchand touched the wall, the rest of his night was a whir of controlled chaos.He sat on the lane line and raised his fists, the crowd’s roar finding new levels of earsplitting with each gesture, then lifted his slender frame out of the pool. He found friends and family in the lower bowl of the stadium and hugged them. He appeared on the top stop of the medal stand and led the crowd in a stirring, unison, full-throated rendition of “La Marseillaise,” the French national anthem.“The emotions are very difficult to describe,” he said. “I think it’s very rare you get to experience this. I had the chance to be here and to be in form and to perform at my [top] level. I opened my eyes, I listened to everything going on around me, and that really pushed me to do a good race.”Before Marchand could make his way to his appointment with the media, he was handed a cellphone. On the other end was French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron appeared to be doing most of the talking, with Marchand’s face mostly locked into a toothy smile, but a practiced lip-reader could see the latter responding from time to time: “Merci beaucoup.”“He told me that he had watched the final with his whole family, that they had screamed, really enjoyed the moment,” Marchand later told French reporters. “It was cool.” The French president also wished him well with the rest of his Olympic program, which includes the 200 IM, 200 butterfly and 200 breaststroke.Scattered across La Défense Arena on Sunday were living, breathing segments of a human arc that collectively closed a great circle of life around Marchand.In the stands were his parents, both of them former French Olympic swimmers. His father, Xavier, was a noted medley swimmer and former national champion who once faced off against a young Phelps and lost to him by nearly nine seconds.In the NBC broadcast booth was Phelps himself, whose last remaining world record was dismantled by Marchand a year ago and who on Sunday night said goodbye to his Olympic record in the event.And on the pool deck was Bob Bowman, who built his name in the sport as Phelps’s coach, guiding the latter to an unprecedented 23 Olympic golds — his reputation such that, some four years ago, a young Marchand cold-emailed him asking whether he would be willing to train a then-18-year-old French kid with big dreams and some intriguing times in the IMs.“He’s the best in history in this event,” said Bowman, who would know perhaps better than anyone on the planet. “He can be better. He’s not reached his potential. That was a great swim. [But] he can definitely swim faster than that.”Two hours before the session began, lines to get in wrapped around the arena. Some fans carried air horns. Some wore homemade masks of Marchand’s face over their own. Face-painted French flags were de rigueur on the cheeks.Once settled into their seats, they did not have to wait long. The 400 IM final was the evening’s first race, with Marchand, in the center lane of the pool, the last to be introduced. Unlike Phelps’s glowering, brooding bundle of prerace intensity, Marchand sauntered onto the pool deck waving to the crowd with both arms. He even shot a warm smile at the television camera following him.In the moment, it seemed like maybe Marchand wasn’t prepared to meet the moment with the proper focus. In hindsight, you can conclude he simply knew what he was about to unleash.“He was in a very good mind-frame before the race. He was relaxed. He had taken a really good nap in the afternoon,” Bowman said. “And I was very confident because he was just being himself.”The French call the four medley strokes papillon (butterfly), dos (backstroke), brasse (breaststroke) and nage libre (freestyle), and Marchand crushed them all, going wire to wire in victory. He led by a half-second after the papillon and by nearly three seconds after the dos, the crowd growing higher in pitch and louder in volume with every length.But it was during the brasse that the dial was cranked to 11, the crowd meeting each of Marchand’s breaths with its collective exhortations. By the time he finished the race, chlorine-addled swimming lifers could find nothing in their memories to compare. Bowman, who had been with Phelps from Sydney to Athens to Beijing to London to Rio de Janeiro, could not remember a more electric atmosphere at a swim meet.“I’m not sure there’s been anything like this,” Bowman said. “It was amazing, really. It was crazy.”Marchand was billed during the run-up to these Games as the face of the Paris Olympics, a designation that may have baffled some, including many American viewers, who were barely familiar with his story.But on Sunday night, millions could finally put a face to the name. It is a baby face, a warm face. And from atop the medal stand, it was framed by a glowing smile and a golden, chiseled chunk of the Eiffel Tower dangling from his neck."
WaPo_5,Exit polling in Venezuela shows opposition beating Maduro by wide margin,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-29 08:00:02.926980,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan opposition was hopeful of an election victory Sunday that could bring an end to the authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro and the socialist state that has controlled this crisis-stricken South American nation for a quarter-century.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition candidate Edmundo González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Edison Research reported. Venezuelans were waiting for official results.The opposition, suffocated by Maduro’s autocratic rule and historically hobbled by infighting, sees its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of migrants, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.Maduro has barred the opposition’s chosen candidate, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. Still, the opposition says it can win — and by a landslide. A high turnout could provide a significant boost; by 4 p.m., González’s campaign estimated that 11.7 million Venezuelans had voted, a participation rate of more than 54 percent.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome remained far from certain. He and his team were confident they can win, according to people familiar with their conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the conversations. If he loses the vote, he’s not expected to cede power willingly.There were reports of blocked access, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital some 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo — armed Maduro supporters on motorbikes — rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Somerville, N.J.,-based Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”The opposition was betting it could turn out voters for a victory so overwhelming that Maduro will be forced to accept the results and begin to negotiate his exit.The number of eligible voters for the election is estimated at about 17 million. Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”If Maduro loses, the United States could play a critical role in a potential negotiated transition, offering legal incentives and relief from sanctions to give Maduro a way out that doesn’t lead him straight to prison.The United States stands ready to “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power,” a senior Biden administration official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration.A Maduro defeat would be a significant foreign policy win for the Biden administration. U.S. officials negotiated a deal last year in which Maduro pledged to hold a competitive election in exchange for some sanctions relief. With irregular immigration at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign, success in Venezuela could boost Vice President Harris’s bid against former president Donald Trump.Venezuela’s opposition candidate, the former diplomat Edmundo González, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. Now polls predict he could beat Maduro by double digits. He is a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focuses on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign has portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.The run-up to the election was far from free and fair. European Union observers who planned to monitor the vote were disinvited, leaving only small teams from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a U.N. panel of experts and a grass-roots group of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans who have been training to watch polling centers.Machado gave a call to action last week: Vote early, stay near the polls and alert the opposition to any suspicious activity. “We will all become citizen reporters,” she said.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Katia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Venezuelans are watching the armed forces and how they respond to any attempt to manipulate the election.Leopoldo López, an opposition leader, said members of the military should consider their own interests, “their own stability, their own future.”“Today, with Edmundo, a transition could be a better source of stability,” he said, “rather than Maduro telling them to go out to kill, to repress, to impose the state.”Maduro has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”Maduro’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said last week he would uphold the law. He called for “the one who won to take charge of his government project and the one who lost, go to rest.”"

Diplomats worked feverishly Sunday to blunt any Israeli retaliation. Lebanon’s government, which would suffer from any escalation, entreated the United States to urge restraint from Israel, Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told Reuters.Israel’s security cabinet — which met on Sunday afternoon after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from the United States — authorized the prime minister and defense minister to decide on the “manner and timing” of the response against Hezbollah, according to a statement issued by Netanyahu’s office Sunday evening.Israel, citing military intelligence and an assessment of the scene, blamed the Saturday strike in Majdal Shams on Hezbollah, as did the United States. “This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement Sunday. “It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control.”Hezbollah denied any connection to the attack.It was the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas rampaged through several communities near the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, drawing Israel’s military response there. The shocking scenes from the Golan — the bodies of children in weekend soccer clothes, blown apart — followed a flood of warnings from the United Nations and diplomats that months of largely contained fighting between Hezbollah and Israel along the border could ignite if given a deadly spark.Egypt’s foreign ministry warned Sunday of the “dangers of opening a new war front in Lebanon” that could push the Middle East into a regional conflict, echoing admonitions from other Arab states over the dangers of failing to secure a cease-fire in Gaza. Hezbollah has said it would end its attacks against Israel in the event of such a cease-fire.In a Sunday morning tweet, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he mourned the victims in Majdal Shams. “We live side by side and all suffer from Hezbollah’s terror,” he said in a message posted on X. “We will ensure Hezbollah, the proxy of Iran, pays a price for this loss.” Earlier, Netanyahu warned: “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expressed sorrow for the loss of life. “Every indication is that indeed … the rocket was from Hezbollah,” he told reporters in Tokyo, where he has been meeting with his Japanese counterparts.“This attack was conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement Sunday. “It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control.”Watson said the United States is “working on a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line that will end all attacks once and for all, and allow citizens on both sides of the border to safely return to their homes.”While the Biden administration believes Hezbollah carried out the attack, the working assumption is that it was an accident, according to a senior U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive assessments. The official cautioned that the administration hasn’t reached a conclusion about the intent behind the attack.Fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified in recent months with regular exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel’s military. The United States has pushed to de-escalate hostilities there. Blinken said he and other top U.S. policymakers were working to ease tensions and bring about a cease-fire in Gaza, which he said would reduce flare-ups on the Israel-Lebanon border.Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, told Reuters that the United States had asked the Lebanese government to pass on a message of restraint to Hezbollah, too.The daily tit-for-tat violence has already claimed dozens of lives. Before the strikes this weekend, at least 94 civilians and more than 300 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon, according to figures compiled this month by The Washington Post.Hundreds of mourners gathered Sunday in a community center in Majdal Shams, a predominantly Druze town in the Golan, for the funeral of those killed in the rocket attack. Sheikh Muwafek Tarif, spiritual leader of the Arab-speaking ethnic Druze in Israel, said it was a day of mourning. There’s much anger in the community, he told the Israeli news outlet Ynet, and he asked what the Israeli government had done for the area’s security.“Harming civilians is a black line,” he said. “The government must bring security to the residents.”Assad Abu Saleh, who lives in Spain but was visiting relatives in Majdal Shams when the projectile struck, said several of the victims belonged to his extended family. “It’s a catastrophe,” he told The Post during the funeral Sunday. He saw “parts of bodies,” he said, and headless torsos.“This war, this stupid war, has to come to an end,” Abu Saleh said, but he was not optimistic. “Both sides are too stubborn to settle for negotiations.”Majd Abu Saleh, an engineer, said he was about 160 feet away from the strike. “All our children, all the time, they are playing” on the field. His 9-year-old daughter had left about five minutes before the strike, he said, but three of her friends were killed.Footage he recorded when he arrived, which The Post reviewed, showed a terrible scene: at least nine children in soccer jerseys and cleats, motionless, their bodies contorted or pierced by shrapnel on the green field.Fawzi Abu Jaber, 72, said he has lived his whole life in Majdal Shams. “I wish to be finished with this tragedy and this crazy war,” he said. The United States, he said, “must back peace, not the war, and not the Israeli government, which doesn’t want peace. Not in Lebanon and in Gaza but in all the Middle East.”Paramedics arrived at the soccer field Saturday to a “very difficult scene,” said United Hatzalah, an Israeli emergency medical services organization. Dozens of children lay injured. Nine victims were declared dead on the scene based on the severity of their injuries, the group said. Israel’s military said the victims were between 10 and 20 years old.The Golan Heights is a 500-square-mile strip along the border between Syria and Israel that Israel seized in 1967 and formally annexed in 1981. In 2019, President Donald Trump upended years of the status quo by making the United States the only country apart from Israel to recognize it as Israeli territory.“There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Channel 12 on Saturday. “We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war against Hezbollah and Lebanon.” A 34-day-war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 left hundreds of soldiers and civilians wounded or dead on both sides. Hezbollah has since received large shipments of rockets and drones from Iran and produced its own weapons. It has air defense capabilities.The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Sunday that the last diplomatic chance to avert a wider war was to push Hezbollah forces away from Israeli territory as stipulated by the 18-year-old U.N. Security Council measure that ended the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.Resolution 1701 calls for the removal of armed personnel and weapons, apart from those belonging to the Lebanese army or a U.N. force, from an area between the temporarily negotiated border, the Blue Line, and Lebanon’s Litani River, which runs roughly parallel to the frontier about 18 miles north.An Israeli official familiar with internal deliberations said the militant group has long violated the resolution’s ban on forces and weapons in the area, encroachments that grew more blatant after the start of the Gaza war. Some Hezbollah positions are within yards of the Blue Line.“We pulled back across the Blue Line,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. “They are in gross violation. They need to pull back, and this is pretty much the last minute for them to.” Lebanon has accused Israel of thousands of violations of 1701, including routine and provocative Israeli encroachments of its airspace, and continued occupation of Lebanese territory in the border area.An earlier version of this story said that Egypt’s foreign ministry warned on Saturday of the dangers of opening a new war front. It made the statement on Sunday. The article has been corrected.Pannett reported from Wellington, New Zealand; Masih from London and Fahim from Beirut.

WaPo_8,Paris Olympics organizers sorry for Last Supper at Opening Ceremonies,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/28/paris-olympics-apology-last-supper/,2024-07-29 10:28:02.838825,,"Organizers of the Paris Olympics apologized on Sunday for a performance during Friday’s Opening Ceremonies that featured an apparent reenactment of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” amid mixed messages about the piece’s intent.The tableau included a woman with a halo-like crown in the role of Jesus as well as drag queens and gay icons as disciples; it was crashed by a scantily clad blue man wearing a headdress of fruit — Dionysus, the Greek god of fertility, wine and revelry.Church leaders and some conservative politicians condemned the performance as a perversion of the scene, recounted in the Bible, on the eve of Jesus’ trial and crucifixion.House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Saturday called the performance a “mockery [that] was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world.” A U.S. telecommunications firm, C Spire, said it was pulling its advertising from the Summer Games. The French Conference of Catholic Bishops also objected.In the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper, Jesus shares bread and wine with his disciples and instructs them to eat and drink in his memory — the basis for the Eucharist, or Communion, the central ritual in Christian worship.Organizers apologized during the Games’ daily news conference on Sunday.“Clearly there was never an intention to show disrespect to any religious group,” spokeswoman Anne Descamps told reporters. “If people have taken any offense we are, of course, really, really sorry.”On Friday, shortly after the performance, the Olympics posted photos of the blue man on X. “The interpretation of the Greek God Dionysus makes us aware of the absurdity of violence between human beings,” the post reads.It doesn’t mention the Last Supper, and some on social media insisted that the performance depicted a Dionysian feast.“The idea was to do a big pagan party linked to the gods of Olympus,” Opening Ceremonies choreographer Thomas Jolly told the Paris-based BFM network on Sunday, according to France 24. “You’ll never find in my work any desire to mock or denigrate anyone.”But organizers reportedly acknowledged Sunday that Jolly “took inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting to create the setting.”“[Jolly] is not the first artist to make a reference to what is a world-famous work of art,” Paris 2024 said in a statement to The Wrap. “From Andy Warhol to ‘The Simpsons,’ many have done it before him.”"
WaPo_9,‘House of the Dragon’ recap: Smallfolk movin’ on up,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/28/house-dragon-recap-season-two-episode-seven/,2024-07-29 10:04:02.838825,,"Elsewhere on this website you may have heard something about a big election coming up. “House of the Dragon,” too, is obsessed with what leadership represents to a citizenship. The show’s plots revolve around who deserves to be in charge, what it takes to get there and the burden of a heavy crown once it’s upon one’s head.Those ideas are best represented in Season 2’s penultimate episode by Rhaenyra’s determination to open up dragonriding to non-royals. The idea was forced upon her by her desperate prewar position and because one of the dragons at her castle, Seasmoke, got loose and chose a commoner as its rider. That commoner, Addam, is not so common: He’s the illegitimate son of Rhaenyra’s Hand, the Sea Snake Corlys. Now, with the knowledge that the pool of potential dragonriders could be much bigger than anyone ever thought, Rhaenyra starts recruiting.Daemon finally gets the support he’s been seeking from the Riverlords, led by newly minted Lord Paramount Plus, Oscar Tully. But this requires Daemon to acknowledge, publicly, that he’s a monster and that the Riverlands are joining Rhaenyra’s alliance despite his horrific actions. This and a strange dream make Daemon wonder whether everything he’s been doing to get to the Iron Throne is worth the trouble.Meanwhile, in King’s Landing, no one throne-adjacent is particularly happy. Aegon is in awful pain, recovering from his burns. Alicent goes camping to avoid the castle’s misery. And Aemond becomes uncomfortably aware that the dragon power dynamic between his side and Rhaenyra’s has flipped.Should control of a realm come to those who are born next in line, or paradigm-shifters who want to take the throne by force? Let’s recap how it played out:Team DaemonDaemon spent this season miserable at Harrenhal, a leaky haunted castle that was essentially the worst Airbnb experience ever. Now, he just needs to convince young Oscar Tully to rally the warring Blackwood and Bracken families to the Tully banner. Teen Tully is ambivalent about Daemon, reminding the Targaryen that he was dismissed as useless when his grandfather was still alive. Despite his distaste, though, Tully plans to honor the oath his house swore to King Viserys.At a meeting under the Godswood tree, Daemon is upstaged by a surprisingly savvy Teen Tully, who manages to thread the needle in front of the doubtful Riverlords. Tully convinces the older leaders they should keep their oath to Viserys despite finding Daemon “loathsome.” Daemon gets a little testy, but Tully makes it simple: “Will you have our army or not?” But there’s one more thing. For justice to be served, something must be done with Willem Blackwood, who led the horrifying campaign sanctioned by Daemon. Blackwood argues that he was just following orders, but Daemon puts him to the sword anyway.The killing leaves Daemon disoriented and out of sorts; inside the castle, he’s bleated at by a judgmental goat. The goat becomes desiccated Viserys, feebly holding a crown in his hand. He says it caused nothing but pain. “It crushes whoever wears it. Do you want it still?” he asks Daemon. For the first time, Daemon seems to think not.Team Alicent, Aemond and AegonSneaky Larys and Grand Maester Orwyle are helping Aegon recover with a new regimen of hobbling around the room on Orwyle’s arm and screaming a lot, followed by shaking exhaustedly in bed. Aegon looks healthier, relatively speaking, but he’s still more Crypt Keeper than king. Aegon wants to give up, but Larys won’t allow him to rest.Larys is also keeping a close eye on Aemond, who is settling in as king regent. Lord Jasper tells Larys he heard the dragon Seasmoke has a rider. But the information has come from such a long chain of sources that Larys advises him to keep the game of telephone to himself.Alicent, meanwhile, has gone from mournful and shellshocked to bored and disassociated. She tells Orwyle, who’s treating her wound from last week’s riot, that nothing she does matters. In the episode’s weirdest turn, Alicent decides to go glamping with a tent and Ser Rickard as her guard. She’s spends the rest of the episode hiking in full royal gear and then swimming in a lake in her undergarments. When Rickard asks when she’s returning to the city, she says she’s not sure she will. Congratulations if you had “Abrupt, Unnecessary Camping” on your Season 2 bingo card.Team RhaenyraRhaenyra is on a seashore with Syrax opposite Seasmoke and that dragon’s new rider, Addam of Hull. When she, queen of the Seven Kingdoms, demands to know how he got this dragon (there’s an unfortunate racial-profiling undertone), Addam says he had no designs on it and that the dragon chose him. Addam wishes to serve Rhaenyra, bent knee and all, and learn the ways of the dragonriders. When Rhaenyra probes his parentage, Addam says his mother was a shipwright and his father was “no one of consequence.” I can just see Corlys wincing at that. Rhaenyra lets her guard down enough to express relief. She says he’s done something impossible and she’s glad.Of course, Rhaenyra’s stodgy council is already talking smack about this unknown rider, saying that the “lowborn” can’t go around seizing dragons like Lime Scooters. Corlys, who is told the rider is a shipwright in his employ, stays quiet. When he meets with Addam later, Corlys agrees to grant his son leave from ship duties so he can pursue … a bachelor’s degree in the dragonly arts? A PhD in Burn Theory? “Well done,” is all Corlys can say. No hug. No high five.When Rhaenyra confers with her trusted associate turned lover, Mysaria suggests that there may be many more offspring given how randy the royals were at her old pleasure house. Rhaenyra has a change in thinking about loyalty and royalty after Mysaria reminds her that common-born folk such as her and Addam are risking their lives to serve while her half-brothers Aemond and Aegon are out for Rhaenyra’s blood. Rhaenyra is convinced: “Let us raise an army of bastards!” But maybe workshop the name a little.Jace is extremely annoyed with this plan, especially “lowborn” claiming dragons. Eek, don’t post that on social media, Jace, you’re gonna get canceled. Because Jace’s biological father wasn’t Laenor and he has dark hair, he now feels like his claim to the throne is in jeopardy. “You are my heir,” Rhaenyra reminds him. Still, Rhaenyra insists, they need more dragons, and this is the only available path. Her minions proceed to spread news that dragons are now available for long-term lease to anyone who might be Targaryen by blood.New facesRhaena, whom we’ve only seen briefly — she’s the sister of Baela and Daemon’s daughter from his previous marriage — wanders off from her caravan outside the Eyrie to investigate the dragon burnings nearby. How soon will it be before she encounters a wild beast and makes it her own?Team SmallfolkThe King’s Landing recruitment campaign reaches two characters we’ve been learning about all season: Ulf the barfly, who claims he’s half brother to Viserys and Daemon, and Hugh the blacksmith.Dozens of people, most with silver-blonde hair, board rowboats overseen by Alyn. Rhaenyra is blown away by how many show up. She gives an inspiring speech for the would-be riders, telling them she doesn’t know if it’s blood or worth that matters now, but she’s impressed that they’re walking away from their lives for a potentially transformative undertaking. She wants peace restored. And she wants a rider for Vermithor, the second-largest dragon in the world next to Vhagar.Everyone gathers at the Dragonpit: Ulf, Hugh, lots of blondes and at least four non-blondes. Vermithor, gigantic, appears. The dragon is becalmed by Rhaenyra, but when she walks away to let the rest vie for him, fire is unleashed. As everyone scrambles, some are incinerated on the spot. Vermithor chomps others, bodies still aflame like this is Fogo de Chão. But Hugh stands tall in front of Vermithor. The dragon bows and they look into each other’s eyes. The only thing missing is Taylor Swift singing, “All along there was some invisible string/ Tying you to me.” Meanwhile Ulf, who has fallen into the pit during the melee, hobbles along trying to escape. A different dragon, one called Silverwing, approaches him and bows. Ulf laughs in relief as they bond, too.We cut to King’s Landing, where a council meeting is interrupted by the sound of a dragon in flight. Ulf, up there on Silverwing, is having the time of his life. Riding Vhagar, Aemond follows Ulf all the way to Dragonstone where Rhaenyra stands on the shore defiantly with three dragons behind her. Wisely, Aemond and his dragon flee.Score one for Rhaenyra’s army of bastards as we head into next week’s season finale."
WaPo_10,"Venezuelans, hopeful for change, await results of tense election",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-29 10:19:02.838825,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan opposition was hopeful of an election victory Sunday that could bring an end to the authoritarian government of Nicolás Maduro and the socialist state that has controlled this crisis-stricken South American nation for a quarter-century.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition candidate Edmundo González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Edison Research reported. But Venezuelans were waiting for official results, and Maduro allies expressed optimism.“We can’t announce the results, but we can use our faces,” National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez told reporters and flashed a smile. The Maduro confidant alluded repeatedly to a government victory.Opposition leaders, meanwhile, denounced what they said was an order to voting center workers to refuse to hand over printouts of voting results to opposition poll watchers.As night fell, violence broke out at some polling centers. When opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — armed Maduro supporters — of at least 150 men on motorbikes arrived shouting pro-government chants.A Washington Post reporter saw the men, wearing black and hooded, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people. “Viva Nicolás,” they shouted.Leiner González, caught in the middle, was beaten and his shirt ripped.“Please, we need change in Venezuela,” the first-time voter, 25, said, “so that there is no more violence in our beloved country from a group of criminals. We demand peace, freedom and truth. Please, we want a transition.”While poll workers counted ballots, opposition leaders urged voters to stay at their local centers and support poll watchers.“We have to keep vigil,” María Corina Machado said in a news conference. “We’ve been fighting all these years for this day and these will be crucial minutes, decisive hours.”The opposition, suffocated by Maduro’s autocratic rule and historically hobbled by infighting, sees its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of migrants, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.Maduro has barred Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician, from running, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. Still, the opposition said it could win — and by a landslide.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome was far from certain. He and his team were confident they would win, according to people familiar with their conversations. If he loses the vote, he’s not expected to cede power willingly.Sunday saw reports of blocked access at voting centers, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital about 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”At midday, Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Somerville, N.J.,-based Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”The opposition was betting it could turn out voters for a victory so overwhelming that Maduro will be forced to accept the results and begin to negotiate his exit.The number of eligible voters for the election is estimated at about 17 million. Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”If Maduro loses, the United States could play a critical role in a potential negotiated transition, offering legal incentives and relief from sanctions to give Maduro a way out that doesn’t lead him straight to prison.The United States stands ready to “consider measures that would facilitate a peaceful transition of power,” a senior Biden administration official said Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration.A Maduro defeat would be a significant foreign policy win for the Biden administration. U.S. officials negotiated a deal last year in which Maduro pledged to hold a competitive election in exchange for some sanctions relief. With irregular immigration at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign, success in Venezuela could boost Vice President Harris’s bid against former president Donald Trump.Venezuela’s opposition candidate, the former diplomat Edmundo González, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. Now polls predict he could beat Maduro by double digits. He is a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focuses on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign has portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.The run-up to the election was far from free and fair. European Union observers who planned to monitor the vote were disinvited, leaving only small teams from the Atlanta-based Carter Center, a U.N. panel of experts and a grass-roots group of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans who have been training to watch polling centers.Machado gave a call to action last week: Vote early, stay near the polls and alert the opposition to any suspicious activity. “We will all become citizen reporters,” she said.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Catia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Venezuelans are watching the armed forces and how they respond to any attempt to manipulate the election.Leopoldo López, an opposition leader, said members of the military should consider their own interests, “their own stability, their own future.”“Today, with Edmundo, a transition could be a better source of stability,” he said, “rather than Maduro telling them to go out to kill, to repress, to impose the state.”Maduro has warned of a “bloodbath” if he loses.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”Maduro’s defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, said last week he would uphold the law. He called for “the one who won to take charge of his government project and the one who lost, go to rest.”"
WaPo_11,"In Sudan’s catastrophe, food runs out as guns flow freely",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/sudan-crisis-famine-guns/,2024-07-29 12:00:02.921247,,"You’re reading an excerpt from the WorldView newsletter. Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.One of the worst famines in decades is on the verge of breaking out in Africa’s third-largest country. Sudan is in the grips of more than 15 months of ruinous civil strife that’s led to untold calamity and horror. Though casualty figures are far from clear, the top U.S. envoy to the region recently suggested that some 150,000 people may have been killed since the conflict between two rival warlords exploded last year. Now, the United Nations claims that some 750,000 people are on the brink of starvation. Western officials liken what’s unfolding to the famine in Somalia in 2011, where a quarter of a million people died, half of whom were children.The war’s vast effects are already measured in superlatives: Sudan is home to the world’s biggest internal displacement crisis, with some 11 million people forced by the fighting to flee their homes. Sudan is home to the world’s largest education crisis, with most schools shuttered and some 19 million children unable to attend classes. And it’s home to the world’s biggest hunger crisis: An estimated 26.6 million people — more than half the population — is “food insecure,” according to U.N. agencies, while 14 areas in the country have been declared “at risk of famine.”The country is being torn apart by forces loyal to two former allies — Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, top commander of the Sudanese military, and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, universally referred to as Hemedti, chief of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, a faction that traces its antecedents to the genocidal campaigns of the Janjaweed militia in the western Darfur region two decades ago. Rather than burying the hatchet, both sides seem bent on further bloodying their enemies as the war sprawls across the country after flaring in the capital, Khartoum, in April 2023.They blame each other for the suffering unleashed on the civilian population, with numerous reports of massacres, mass rapes and other atrocities. Bombardments and airstrikes indiscriminately flatten neighborhoods. There are documented cases of war crimes, particularly involving the RSF and allied militias slaughtering ethnic non-Arabs in towns and cities they’ve seized. Widespread looting and violence wrecked harvests across Sudan’s agricultural sector, and relief groups complain of severe difficulties bringing aid into the country.A team of my Washington Post colleagues recently toured through five cities in Sudan and recounted the scale of the disaster. “In the emergency wards, the hennaed hands of mothers fanned the twig-like ribcages of babies struggling for breath, and other parents told of sleeping children killed in their beds when artillery shells crashed into their neighborhoods,” my colleagues reported. “Prisoners and soldiers alike spoke of young men shot far from home, their corpses decaying in the heat, before they were flung in unmarked graves.”The warring parties have agreed to participate in fresh negotiations, facilitated by a joint U.S. and Saudi-led effort and slated to be held in Switzerland next month. “The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement last week.The conflict has been punctuated by myriad false dawns, with repeated cease-fires and truces barely lasting days, even hours, after they’re clinched. Aid organizations warn that the Sudanese military — which represents the faction formally recognized as Sudan’s government by the United Nations — is impeding the flow of critical food assistance into western areas of the country controlled by the RSF. What supplies do cross the border are often subject to diversion or looting, while the RSF’s rampages across Sudan’s breadbasket regions contribute to the food shortages.For relief groups, access to imperiled communities and the resources needed to help them are both scarce. A Paris donor conference in April pooled some $2 billion in pledges for Sudan — just half of the figure requested by the United Nations — but the promised funds have yet to fully materialize.“In a survey released last week, Mercy Corps said that one quarter of children in central Darfur state were so malnourished that they could soon die,” reported the New York Times. “Experts say that only the World Food Program, the world’s largest humanitarian organization with a budget of $8.5 billion last year, has the resources and expertise needed to ramp up an emergency operation at scale. But without unimpeded access to the border, providing aid is proving extremely challenging.”The war rages on, shaped by a thicket of conflicting geopolitical interests. “The [Sudanese military] is currently supported politically or materially by Egypt, Iran and Ukraine,” noted Ilhan Dahir of the United States Institute of Peace. “Meanwhile, the RSF is allegedly supported by the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit, and the UAE, which has reportedly sent arms to support Hemedti in an effort to ‘roll back Islamist influence’ in Sudan as a part of the Emirates’ larger strategy in the region. Continued external interference in Sudan is likely to prolong the war.”A briefing by rights group Amnesty International last week charted “the constant flow of weapons” into the conflict. The group documented the presence of new arms and ammunition from countries as diverse as China, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, the UAE and Yemen, imported in “large quantities into Sudan” and then proliferating across its battlefields, including in the benighted Darfur region, which is subject to a two-decade-old U.N. arms embargo.“Our research shows that weapons entering the country have been placed into the hands of combatants who are accused of international humanitarian and human rights law violations,” said Amnesty’s Deprose Muchena in a statement. “It is clear that the existing arms embargo that currently applies only to Darfur is completely inadequate, and must be updated and extended to cover the whole of Sudan. This is a humanitarian crisis that cannot be ignored.”"
WaPo_12,Miss Manners: My well-off friend treats me to expensive outings,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/29/miss-manners-reciprocate-nice-restaurants/,2024-07-29 11:59:02.921247,,"Dear Miss Manners: I’m not well-off, and my friend is. She loves eating at nice restaurants. I can’t afford those, so I usually take her out for hamburgers. She knows my financial circumstances.I am very uncomfortable letting her treat me to fancy outings because I'm unlikely to ever be able to reciprocate. When I've asked her to take me to inexpensive hamburger joints, she will make excuses like she wants to try a restaurant she just heard about, and I'm the only one who can go with her.Should I refuse to accompany her? Or give up and figure that she can afford it, and that she doesn’t care that I can’t reciprocate?The latter is obviously the case, but you should still reciprocate — just not in a restaurant competition. Unless you can find a really good restaurant that is not yet well-enough known to charge high prices.Nah. Your friend would not be able to resist telling her rich friends about it, and the prices would soar. If you must stick with food, perhaps you can manage a good home-cooked meal.But you needn't; there are other ways to reciprocate. She must have interests besides eating well. You could give her a small, well-chosen present, such as a book that might interest her, or a gadget that could solve some problem she mentioned. Or volunteer to run an errand, saving her time or stress.You needn't do this at every meeting, as if in payment for lunch. Just often enough to show that you care about your friend and enjoy contributing to her happiness, as she does to yours. That is what reciprocation in friendship is.Dear Miss Manners: I’m in serious need of help. My husband and I are both considered leaders in our community, although my husband has a professional role as such, while I do not. I was quoted in a newspaper, and people have mentioned to my husband that my statement resonated with their own feelings. One gentleman said, “Your wife is becoming more famous than you.”While I thought this comment was rude and offensive, he insisted it was “just a joke.” Yet my husband's reply was, “Yes, well, one of us has to work.”I found his response disrespectful. I know this is all about his ego — which is why I was upset about the original comment, which I felt was a slight. However, I am deeply upset by his reply, which not only insulted me, but did so while speaking to someone else. I am even more hurt because I wanted to come to his defense about the “more famous” line, and before I could, he used it as an opportunity to put me down.I really don’t know what to do and wonder if I’m making too much of it.Now Miss Manners is in need of help. It seems to her that if anyone was insulted here, it would be your husband, for the implication that he was in competition with his own wife.But why make something of this trivial exchange instead of deflecting it, as your husband did? Is there some sinister subtext missing here?New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

WaPo_13,Carolyn Hax: Type A parent wants to tell chronically late partner to be on time,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/29/carolyn-hax-type-a-partner-late/,2024-07-29 11:59:02.921247,,"Adapted from an online discussion.Dear Carolyn: I’m for sure a type A personality, and my partner is, well, not. She’s got kind of a hippie vibe. I adore her but struggle with our different approaches to things, particularly because I feel hers has negative consequences.Today, our 6-year-old is starting swim lessons. My partner is taking him. I’m pretty confident they’re going to be late. We’ve been together 10 years, and I still have no idea how to tell her to not be late without her getting angry at me. What can I do?— Type AType A: Accept that they will be late, or make other arrangements. It’s not okay, but it’s also not changing. (See: 10 years.)Re: Late: The lateness is a problem, but you don’t solve it by telling another adult what to do when she isn’t your subordinate at work. You know this is who she is. Work with it or around it. You’re going to drive both of you crazy if you keep expecting her to change.— Anon 1Anon 1: Yes, 100 percent on the principle, thanks. And in practice, a reminder to Type A: Has telling her ever worked?Re: Late: I agree about “telling her,” but why shouldn’t we express to our partners the need to change behavior that is objectively problematic?— Anon 2Anon 2: Once? Sure. For 10 years? Nope.Re: Late: When it’s between you two, there is a pass. When it leaks down to kids, then is this what they want to teach them?— Anon 3Anon 3: See … no. This is a great example of when being right is wrong.Of course you don’t want the kids to miss part of their lesson, or to learn it’s okay to be late and burden the instructor, or to feel they’re not their parents’ priority, or whatever. There is no defense for being late.Which is good, because that’s not the point. The point is that even if it worked, which it doesn’t, adults in personal relationships don’t get to correct, scold, chastise, negatively review or supervise each other, not even as co-parents.If there’s an issue, then they can discuss the issue, sure. Like equals. But if it’s recurrent, then it’s time to switch the topic from promptness to the twin topics of autonomy and utility. 1. Loving adult life partners won’t stay that way long if one of them corrects the other like a problem employee. 2. Badgering someone is proof that badgering doesn’t work, or else there would be no need for badgering.So, to recap, having and re-having this conversation won’t get anyone anywhere on time, but will demoralize both partners, in at least partial view of the kids.So. Choose your partner, then trust your choice, lumps and all, addressing stuff on the margins as a team of equals — and any bigger stuff as needed with professional help.Re: Late: It’s possible your child will get upset if he is late. Having your son get mad might be different, so let them work it out between them.— Anon 4Anon 4: Fair, thanks.Re: Late: Many chronically late adults already feel significant shame as a result. (Undiagnosed ADHD is a common underlying issue.) You cannot shame anyone into improving. It doesn’t work.Try asking instead: “What can I do to help get Susie ready?” Or do it yourself if it’s that important to you.— Anon 5Anon 5: A hearty yes to this, thanks. Or hire it out. One caveat: Help offers can sound transparent and shamey if you’re not careful."
WaPo_14,Asking Eric: Sober couple continues to split the check with friends who drink,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/29/asking-eric-check-drinks-sober/,2024-07-29 11:59:02.921247,,"Dear Eric: For the past 10 years, my husband and I have enjoyed dining out with a couple of our friends, always splitting the check evenly.Recently, we embraced sobriety and no longer consume the expensive drinks that significantly add to the bill. Despite this, we continue to split the check evenly, which doesn't seem quite fair.We value our friendship and enjoy our time together, but we are unsure how to approach this topic. We don’t want to look cheap, but we also want to be fair. Is it weird, rude or impolite to request that we each pay for our own meals and drinks moving forward?— Sober DinerDiner: Ten years of shared bills is a long time. At a certain point, splitting the check stops being about the money and starts being a gesture of mutual good will.So, this about-face may feel like it’s coming out of nowhere for your friends. It’s also likely to bring up other possible inequities and invite “nickel and diming” into your meals. Did your friends once order only soup and salad while you dined on steak? Was that unfair? How much was the blue-plate special? Who ordered “gratuity”?If this is affecting your sobriety or your friendship, you should say something. I wouldn’t frame it using “fairness” — that way is littered with nickels and dimes. Tell them that though you’ve made this change in your lives, you still love dining with them. Tell them you’d rather not pay for alcohol. This should be easy for them to understand.Dear Eric: I had a conversation with some pals and disclosed that I am biased against seriously overweight people. I am talking about people who are so overweight they must use scooters to get from their car to anywhere. They are so overweight they are often afflicted with Type 2 diabetes. They have to take medication to moderate their excess fluids.I am disgusted when seeing overweight actors in commercials and television shows. I disagree with the normalization of being overweight. I believe it is not healthy or something noble.I myself am moderately overweight (5-6, 180 pounds), and I hate it. I had a professional career in the entertainment industry and fought my weight the entire time. The times I weighed less I got hired for more work. And I feel better and can function better when I weigh less.So am I the jerk?— Sizing Up OthersSizing: Yes, but …YES. Why are you thinking so much about other people's bodies? When people complain about fatness they like to state that obesity is an epidemic. But unless you're an epidemiologist, I'm not sure what you're adding to the conversation.Taking offense to another person's size is a waste of time.BUT: You are part of a culture and an industry that has taught you to hate fatness and to see being overweight as a moral failing. This is not your fault. No one is immune. A couple of years ago, celebrity rapper Cardi B received an Instagram comment from a fan who speculated she was pregnant. Cardi B shot back that she was not pregnant at the time and added “Let me fat in peace.” What a phrase!I don't think your disgust is really about these strangers you see on commercials. It's about yourself. You've been taught by casting directors and ads that if you look a certain way, you'll be more well-liked and more well-off. Of course you'd come to resent any weight gain.If you work on loving and accepting yourself more, you'll be happier, and other people's weight would bother you less. This is easier said than done, of course, but it's important work.Are you, at your core, a jerk? I don't think so. Go in peace (at whatever size works for you).Dear Eric: Having just read your column in the Boulder Daily Camera, I am inspired to write. Please discontinue the use of the phrase “rule of thumb.” Its origin is, I believe, from colonial days when it was legal for a man to beat his wife with a stick no larger than the circumference of his thumb. I point this out whenever I hear it and most people are unaware of its origin.Reader: Thank you so much for this education. Your letter prompted me to do some digging around. The phrase does have a complicated history of which I was unaware.From what I've read, it predates colonial times. Some sources say its origin is in the measuring of buildings or cloth. The usage you put forth is also frequently cited, though there is no evidence it is directly connected to any law sanctioning or directing the application of marital abuse.Either way, words and phrases often take on lives of their own. As someone who loves clarity and good communication, I won’t use it again.(Send questions to R. Eric Thomas at eric@askingeric.com or P.O. Box 22474, Philadelphia, PA 19110.

WaPo_15,Warring parties in Sudan accused of carrying out wave of rapes,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/sudan-war-rape-rsf-military/,2024-07-29 11:00:02.921247,,"Fighters on both sides of Sudan’s civil war have carried out a wave of rapes, including attacking women in front of their families, sexually assaulting them in the hospital and fatally injuring them during gang rapes, according to a report by Human Rights Watch released on Monday.The victims were between the ages of 9 and at least 60, and some were held captive over extended periods so they could be repeatedly raped, the report says.During a recent trip to Sudan, Washington Post journalists interviewed survivors who said they had been assaulted, including a woman and a girl in the city of Omdurman who recounted that fighters with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces had raped them and threatened their families to force them to become spies. The RSF has been engaged in a withering conflict with Sudan’s military after a power-sharing arrangement collapsed 15 months ago.The woman, who had graduated from a university after studying hospitality, said RSF fighters had detained her at a checkpoint and took her to a building with 15 other women and girls.“They suspected me” of being a spy, she said. “They beat my knees, then they beat my back. They beat me in the face,” she added, pointing to her missing teeth. “Then the rapes began.”Every three days, she said, a girl would vanish from detention. Sometimes they came back, and sometimes they didn’t. When asked, jailers said the girls had “gone to God,” she said.The women who were interviewed by The Post spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, and all the interviews were conducted in the presence of a Sudanese security officer.The university graduate, who spoke while in military detention, said the RSF had pressured her to spy for them and threatened her five young children, saying they knew where she lived. After 13 days of abuse, she agreed, but soon after she turned herself in to the military. She hasn’t seen her children since.“I just want to go home. I just want to see my children again. I want to bring them here,” she whispered, shredding a tissue between her bitten fingernails.The woman was held in the same military detention center as a 15-year-old girl who said she had also been detained by the RSF at a checkpoint and raped for two days. Her brother was beaten, she said, and the fighters threatened to kill him unless she became a spy. She agreed, she said, but was arrested when she arrived in a neighborhood controlled by the military.Neither victim had received medical attention since being detained, despite reporting their rapes, they said.The HRW report accuses both the Sudanese military and the RSF of committing rapes and focused on assaults that occurred in the capital, Khartoum. The report relies on testimony from 42 people who tended to the women, including health-care providers, counselors and social workers, because the war prevented HRW researchers from traveling to Sudan to speak with survivors.The group notes that most of its research focused on events that occurred in areas under RSF control but that rapes by the military increased after it took control of the city of Omdurman, across the Nile River from Khartoum.Among the cases cited by the report was a girl who sought help on social media after being raped but later died by suicide; a mother and her four daughters repeatedly raped in their own home; and a girl, her mother and her grandmother who were raped together. The report says some men had also been sexually abused.In a statement, the RSF said it “does not claim to eliminate all violations, but it seeks vigorously and professionally, in accordance with international humanitarian law and international human rights law, to eliminate them or reduce them.” A military spokesman said he had not seen the report and could not comment.The report says both warring parties had threatened and detained doctors, nurses and emergency-care responders because of their work, including providing support to survivors of rape. The military blocked the provision of medical supplies to RSF-held areas, the report says, a complaint repeated by other medical aid groups.The report says RSF fighters had also sexually attacked health-care providers and arrested and threatened to kill a health worker who documented rapes. Another doctor told The Post by phone that she had been raped when the RSF invaded her hospital.One women’s rights activist told HRW about two sisters held by RSF fighters for three days with many other women and girls from South Sudan and Ethiopia. They described being raped, beaten and starved. An emergency room volunteer in northern Khartoum said a teenage girl had been seized by the RSF in early June 2023, raped and held for a month alongside other women.In the town of Shendi, Post journalists spoke with an RSF fighter accused of committing rapes. While the fighter was stationed on the island of Tutti, once an upmarket Khartoum neighborhood, local residents alleged on Facebook that he carried out gang rapes, extortion and other crimes. The Facebook post, shared by a Sudanese intelligence officer, included the fighter’s name and photograph.The fighter, who was held by the military at the time of the interview, confirmed he had been stationed on Tutti but denied taking part in rapes. He said other RSF fighters would often enter homes and “then you would hear a woman screaming for help.”"
WaPo_16,Maduro’s electoral council declares him winner of Venezuelan election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-29 12:11:02.615069,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s electoral council declared the authoritarian socialist the winner of Venezuela’s election Sunday despite independent exit polling that suggested opposition candidate Edmundo González had captured twice as many votes.The opposition, which sent thousands of ordinary citizens to monitor voting centers across the country Sunday, was expected to challenge the result.The electoral council said Maduro won with 51 percent of the vote to González’s 44 percent.The opposition had seen the vote as its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States.As votes were being counted, opposition leaders denounced what they said was a government order to voting center workers to refuse to hand over printouts of voting results to opposition poll watchers.Alexis Cedeño, an opposition campaign coordinator for Caracas, said poll workers at a majority of voting centers in the capital were denying opposition poll watchers the physical copies, which are used to corroborate machine counts.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed opposition González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, Somerville, N.J.-based Edison Research reported.“The results are undeniable,” González said in a post on X. “The country chose change in peace.”As night fell, violence broke out at some polling centers. When opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — a gang of at least 150 Maduro supporters on motorbikes — arrived shouting pro-government chants.A Washington Post reporter saw the men, hooded and wearing black, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people. “Viva Nicolás,” they shouted.Leiner González, caught in the middle, was beaten, and his shirt was ripped.“Please, we need change in Venezuela,” the first-time voter, 25, said, “so that there is no more violence in our beloved country from a group of criminals. We demand peace, freedom and truth. Please, we want a transition.”While poll workers counted ballots, opposition leaders urged voters to stay at their local centers and support poll watchers.“We have to keep vigil,” María Corina Machado, the face of the opposition campaign, said in a news conference. “We’ve been fighting all these years for this day, and these will be crucial minutes, decisive hours.”Delsa Solórzano, an opposition’s electoral council observer, decried a “concerning, widespread pattern.” She said she and others had not been allowed into the council headquarters.She said the printouts the opposition had seen so far showed that “Venezuela has a reason to celebrate.”Perkins Rocha, another opposition council observer, said the opposition was “willing to defend the happiness citizens expressed today in the streets.”“The world’s eyes are upon Venezuela,"" he said. “Beware government officials: Don’t mock citizens. Just like you, we have the proof of what the votes were. It’s time to tell the truth.”In the runup to the vote Sunday, the government barred Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician, from running, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media.Still, the opposition said it could win — and by a landslide.But in a country where the electoral council, courts and military are controlled by Maduro, the outcome was far from certain.Sunday saw reports of blocked access at voting centers, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital about 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”At midday, Machado said problems at voting centers “were exceptions to a process that is developing peacefully.”“The way things are going, I think we are going to have, as they say, irreversible results,” she said at a voting center in Caracas.Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”Several voting centers saw long lines. It was not possible to determine whether this reflected the greater turnout that the opposition had said would be its key to victory, but some voters in Caracas said they hadn’t seen such long crowds in many years.“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”González, a former diplomat, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. But as the election loomed, polls predicted he could beat Maduro by double digits.He ran as a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focused on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Washington Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Catia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”Maduro had warned of a “bloodbath” if he lost.“The destiny of Venezuela depends on our victory,” he told rallygoers this month. “If we want to avoid a bloodbath or a fratricidal civil war triggered by the fascists, then we must guarantee the biggest electoral victory ever.”"

WaPo_18,Palestinians recount deadly abuse in Israeli prisons: ‘It is Guantánamo’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/palestinian-prisoners-israel-jails-abuse/,2024-07-29 13:59:02.794492,,"One Palestinian inmate died with a ruptured spleen and broken ribs after being beaten by Israeli prison guards.Another met an excruciating end because a chronic condition went untreated.A third screamed for help for hours before dying.The details of the prisoners’ deaths were recounted by eyewitnesses and corroborated by doctors from Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), who sat in on autopsies, the findings of which were shared with families and obtained by The Washington Post. The three men are among at least 12 Palestinians from the West Bank and Israel to die in Israeli jails since Oct. 7, according to PHRI. An unknown number of prisoners from the Gaza Strip have also died.Rights groups say conditions in Israel’s jam-packed prisons have deteriorated dangerously since the Hamas attacks on Israel. Former Palestinian prisoners described routine beatings, often carried out on entire cells or sections, usually with batons and sometimes with dogs. They said they were denied sufficient food and medical care and were subjected to psychological as well as physical abuse.The Post spoke to 11 former prisoners and half a dozen lawyers, examined court records and reviewed autopsy reports, revealing rampant, sometimes deadly violence and deprivation by Israeli prison authorities.While international attention and condemnation has focused on the plight of Gazan detainees — specifically at the notorious Sde Teiman military site — rights advocates say there is a deeper, systemic crisis in Israel’s penal system.“Violence is pervasive,” said Jessica Montell, executive director of the Israeli rights group HaMoked, which has worked for years with Palestinian inmates. “It’s very overcrowded. Every prisoner that we’ve met with has lost 30 pounds.”Tal Steiner, executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, attributes the abuses, in part, to an atmosphere of revenge in Israel following Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault. “It’s a combination of individual sentiments that are very negative and violent, of backing of the policymakers and of lack of accountability,” she said.Asked about the prisoners who have died behind bars since Oct. 7, as well the other allegations detailed in this story, Israel’s prison service said in a statement: “We are not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred. Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.”“All prisoners are detained according to the law,” the statement continued. “All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.”The International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant over Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Conditions in the country’s jails could lead to more international legal action, Israeli intelligence chief Ronen Bar warned in a letter to prison authorities on June 26.“Israel is having difficulty repelling claims against it, at least some of which are well founded,” he wrote in a letter viewed by The Post and first published by Ynet.The prison system, built for 14,500 inmates, was housing 21,000, the letter said, not including an estimated 2,500 detainees from Gaza, most held in military facilities.“The incarceration crisis creates threats to Israel’s national security, its foreign relations and its ability to realize the war goals it set for itself,” Bar concluded.Israel’s internal intelligence agency, the Shin Bet, did not respond to requests for comment on Bar’s letter.But Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister who oversees the prison system, has been unapologetic about his “war” on Palestinian detainees. In a post on X this month responding to Bar, he boasted that he had “dramatically reduced” shower time and introduced a “minimal menu.”The simplest solution to prison overcrowding, he said, would be capital punishment.Ben Gvir’s office did not respond to a request for comment.For Abdulrahman Bahash, 23, his prison stay became a death sentence.His family said he was a member of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades — listed as a terrorist group by Israel and the United States — and was arrested in connection with armed clashes with Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Nablus.Israel’s prison service said it could not detail what, if any, charges were brought against Bahash or the other prisoners in the story.Two of Bahash’s fellow inmates at Megiddo Prison, a facility in northern Israel where at least three prisoners have died since October, linked his killing to a particularly severe beating by guards on their block in December. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.Officers raided all cells on the wing and handcuffed the inmates before beating them, according to a 28-year-old prisoner who was detained in the same section. He said similar beatings happened twice a week while he was incarcerated.Guards went at them “in a crazy way,” the prisoner said. “They used their batons, they kicked us … all over our bodies.”After the beating, he said, Bahash and other members of his cell were taken to an area of isolation rooms nicknamed “Tora Bora,” after al-Qaeda’s Afghan cave network.“The noise of the screams was all over the section,” he said. Bahash returned with deep bruises, complaining his ribs might be broken. When he sought medical assistance, his prisonmate said, he was sent back with Acemol, a simple pain killer.“In the end, he was incapable of standing on his feet,” he said. “We helped him walk around as if he was a child.”Bahash died about three weeks later, on Jan. 1.A post-mortem “revealed signs of traumatic injury to the right chest and left abdomen, causing multiple rib fractures and spleen injury, potentially the result of assault,” read a report from Daniel Solomon, a doctor with PHRI who was given permission by prison authorities to sit in on the autopsy.Septic shock and respiratory failure following the injuries were listed as potential causes of death. The official autopsy results have been withheld from the family, as has Bahash’s body.Israel’s Prison Service did not respond to questions about why his body has not been returned to his relatives.Saeb Erekat, his brother-in-law, said the young man was in peak physical shape before prison. He described Megiddo as a “graveyard.”Bahash’s autopsy was one of five that doctors from PHRI were able to attend on behalf of prisoners’ families after applying for permission from the courts.Abdul Rahman al-Maari, 33, died in Megiddo on Nov. 13. A carpenter and father of four, Maari had been in prison since February 2023, according to his brother Ibrahim, who said he was arrested at a temporary checkpoint and accused of being affiliated with Hamas and possessing a firearm.Relatives lost touch with him after Oct. 7, when family visits were shut down. They are still trying to piece together the details of his death.A report by PHRI doctor Danny Rosin from his autopsy found that “Bruises were seen over the left chest, with broken ribs and chest bone underneath. … External bruises were also seen on the back, buttocks, left arm and thigh, and right side of the head and neck.”Khairy Hamad, 32, a prisoner in the same section, said Maari was kicked down a flight of about 15 metal stairs while handcuffed — a punishment for speaking back to guards during a room search as inmates were stripped and beaten.Hamad said he and his cellmates had been ordered to the ground floor and Maari landed about five yards away from him. He was conscious, he said, but bleeding from the head. Maari, too, was moved to isolation in Tora Bora. From the cell next door, 53-year-old lawyer Sariy Khourieh listened to him wail in pain for hours.“He was screaming all day and night,” Khourieh said. “I need a doctor,” he remembers him shouting, again and again.At 4 a.m., he finally fell silent.In the morning, Khourieh listened as the guards discovered the lifeless body and called a doctor. He heard them try to revive Maari with a defibrillator, then saw him taken out in a body bag.“In a modern society, things like this shouldn’t happen,” his brother said.Reports of medical assistance being denied are pervasive in the testimonies of former prisoners. The death of Muhammed al-Sabbar, 21, on Feb. 28 could have been avoided if his chronic condition had been treated properly, according to Rosin from PHRI, who sat in on his autopsy.Sabbar’s family said he was arrested for incitement in connection with posts he made online. He had suffered since childhood from Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition that causes severe, painful bowel blockages. He needed a special diet and medication.Sabbar’s stomach began to swell in October after he was denied his medication, said Atef Awawda, 54, one of his cellmates. A prison doctor had given him a single injection earlier that month, Awawda recalled, but told Sabbar not to tell anyone. “This was the last time we received medicine,” he said.“Mohammed’s death could have been avoided with stricter adherence to his medical needs,” Rosin’s letter to his family said, describing his colon as dilated and filled with a large amount of fecal matter.By the time he was rushed to an emergency room, “his condition was already such that the chance of saving him was slim,” the report concluded.A record 9,700 Palestinian security prisoners were being held in Israeli prisons in May, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoner rights organization. Some 3,380 were administrative detainees, the group said, held without charge or trial. The numbers do not include prisoners from Gaza; Israeli authorities will not reveal exactly how many have been detained or where they are held.Cells made for six sometimes held double that number, former inmates said, with mattresses placed on the floor.Some said coverings were removed from cell windows in the winter to expose them to the cold. Others said the Israeli national anthem was played incessantly at high volumes; lights were left on at night to disturb their sleep.One Palestinian prisoner was beaten in front of a judge as he joined a hearing via video link in November, according to his lawyer and court records reviewed by The Post.“We can hear now in the background cries of people being beaten,” the court minutes read. The shouts stopped when the judge intervened.“My nose is broken,” said the defendant, whose name was redacted in court records. “I ask that the hearing not end before they promise not to hit me.”Violence and medical negligence were accompanied by the withholding of food, former prisoners recounted. Each said they had lost significant weight in jail, shedding between 30 and 50 pounds.Journalist Moath Amarneh, 37, imprisoned for six months in Megiddo after filming demonstrations in the West Bank, said his six-person cell held up to 15 people during his stay.The inmates would share a plate of vegetables and yogurt for breakfast. For lunch, each prisoner received half a cup of rice, and the cell — however many men were in it — would divvy up a plate of sliced tomatoes or cabbage. On good days, there might be sausage or beans. Dinner was an egg and some vegetables, he said.“It’s barely enough to survive,” said lawyer Aya al-Haj Odeh, who said some clients reported being given as little as three slices of bread a day or a few spoonfuls of rice and having limited access to drinking water.The Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the Supreme Court in April over what it called it a “policy of starvation.” Ben Gvir wrote to the group taking credit for the policy, saying he was working to “worsen the conditions” of security prisoners to “create deterrence,” the ACRI said.Muazzaz Obayat, 37, could barely walk when he left Ktzi’ot, in southern Israel, last week. He was arrested in the aftermath of Oct. 7 on suspicion of ties to Hamas, but no charges were ever brought against him.His curly black hair and beard were unkempt; his cheekbones jutted out, and his eyes were sunken.At a clinic in the West Bank town of Beit Jala where he was receiving medical care, he said he wasn’t sure how old he was or the ages of his five children.“I know nothing but imprisonment,” he said.Once an amateur bodybuilder, he said he’d lost more than 100 pounds in nine months.He whispered as he described a guard sexually assaulting him with a broom. His doctors said he was suffering from post-traumatic stress and malnutrition.“It is Guantánamo,” he said.Hajar Harb in London and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed."
WaPo_19,Cabinet authorizes Netanyahu to decide response to Golan Heights strike,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,2024-07-29 13:50:02.794492,,"Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister to decide on the “manner and timing” of Israel’s response to a weekend rocket attack launched from Lebanon that killed 12 people, most of them teenagers and children, in the village of Majdal Shams, as global diplomats urge restraint to prevent the war in Gaza from spilling over into a regional conflict.Israel’s military struck a number of Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon on Sunday. But the response so far has stopped short of the fierce retaliation Netanyahu pledged after the strike on a soccer field in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday. It was the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage. The Israel Defense Forces released a list on Sunday of victims aged 10-16.The militant group Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has denied any connection to the attack, which followed months of cross-border skirmishes between Israel’s military and Hezbollah.In a sign of the escalating regional tensions, Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, hit back at vague suggestions Sunday from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Turkey could enter Israel as it had done in the past in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan.Erdogan did not provide any more detail in his remarks, which were made in a televised address in his hometown, according to Reuters. Turkey has vigorously criticized Israeli military operations in Gaza.Lebanon’s main airline, Middle East Airlines, rescheduled flights to and from the capital of Beirut on Sunday and Monday, citing “technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks.” Among the departures affected by the delays were Monday flights to Cairo; Nice, France; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. German airline Lufthansa announced it was suspending flights to Beirut through Tuesday, Reuters reported.At least 39,324 people have been killed and 90,830 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry, which is run by Hamas, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza."
WaPo_20,Simone Biles urged her to endure. Now she’s Biles’s top challenger.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/rebeca-andrade-simone-biles-olympics/,2024-07-29 13:00:02.794492,,"RIO DE JANEIRO — In the flat fluorescent light of the gym, Rebeca Andrade took off her glasses, rubbed a pinch of chalk into her palms and, readying herself, took flight — the world’s strongest challenger to the historic dominance of U.S. Olympian Simone Biles.Andrade, 25, snatched the lower of the uneven bars out of the air and began her routine, conveying the lithe beauty and explosive power that has lifted her from urban poverty, made her into one of Latin America’s most popular athletes, and now has brought her into the same conversation as Biles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, recipient of 30 Olympic medals.No one doubts that Biles, 27, is still the superior athlete. Not even Andrade’s own team contests it.But now, as they prepare for an anticipated showdown at the Paris Games, Biles has a real challenger for the first time in years. The room for error has shrunk. If a mistake mars Biles’s brilliance, it could be Andrade who ascends the podium’s final step.Despite the narrowing gap in their abilities, the relationship between the pair, who are of similar ages and backgrounds, bears little of the animus that often characterizes rivalries among elite performers. At competitions, they cheer each other on. And at crucial junctures in Andrade’s career, moments when she questioned whether she’d ever realize her potential, Biles has gone further, encouraging the athlete fated to be her top competitor.In 2018, Andrade was struggling to regain her form following a significant knee injury, the second of three. Biles took the younger athlete aside and told her she was too talented to give up. When Andrade managed to best Biles on vault at last year’s world championship, the American mimed lifting an imaginary crown off her head and placing it atop the Brazilian’s. That evening, Biles approached Andrade again at a party, and the world’s greatest gymnasts danced together.🇺🇸🤝🇧🇷👑🤝👑 pic.twitter.com/pC7wPNC7cS“I’ve grown such affection for her,” Andrade told The Washington Post.“I actually love competing with Rebeca,” Biles has said of Andrade. “She does push me.”Andrade is now ready to do more than push Biles. She wants to win. And there are some who think she has a chance.“We’re going to see a grand duel happen in Paris,” said Daiane dos Santos, the first Brazilian gymnast to win gold at the gymnastics world championship. “They’re going to come in full force, with the same objective, to show who in fact is the best: Who will win?”Their showdown is, in many ways, a triumph of the improbable.If Andrade’s aunt had not worked as a cook at a São Paulo gym that housed a program to combat poverty through gymnastics, she never would have recommended the 5-year-old. If Andrade’s older brother had not been so devoted to her success — he biked her often to practice — Andrade would have dropped out. And if that brother, Emerson Andrade, had not convinced a man to sell him an old bike for $3, rather than $4, they’d have had little way of getting there.But perhaps the most unlikely twist came in 2015, when it was clear Andrade was Brazil’s next great gymnastics talent. That was when Andrade, then 16, tore her right ACL. For a sport in which agility is everything and the slightest corporal alteration can differentiate victory from defeat, an ACL injury can wreck a career.“She was telling me, ‘My knee isn’t the same, it doesn’t bend right,’” Emerson Andrade said. “My mother couldn’t even watch, staying in the kitchen, because Rebeca was crying in pain.”But Andrade made it back. Only to tear the same ligament again in 2017.It was over, she told her coach. She’d never be the same. “She said, ‘Xico, I don’t want it anymore,’” coach Xico Porath recalled.Again, she underwent surgery, and again, she started preparing for a comeback. Her performance when she reached the 2018 world championships in Qatar was underwhelming. She didn’t medal in a single event. Doubts — potentially fatal to the individual athlete — began to invade her thoughts.When the meet was over, Andrade sat by herself, outside the hotel lobby on a bench. That was when she saw Biles. The American, already a superstar, had medaled in every event, the first woman to do so in decades. Andrade watched as the she glided past.Then the American turned. She sat down next to Andrade.“It was such a kind moment, so affectionate, because there was no one else around,” Andrade said. “She told me, ‘Don’t give up. You’re talented. And you’re going to get past this.’”Gymnastics rewards risk and daring. Even when an athlete fails to execute a difficult element, the fact that she attempted it factors into her final score.This is where Biles is without rival. Her kineticism enables skills no other female gymnast can match. Even when she doesn’t land them, the sheer difficulty of her routine puts her on the podium. One of her signature elements is a triple-twisting double tuck — also known as the Biles II. It’s a single leap from the floor in which, once in the air, she rotates her body around two axes simultaneously, flipping head over heels twice and twisting sideways three times. Once, she stayed afloat for nearly 1.2 seconds.Biles’s representatives did not respond to a request for an interview.To attempt such acrobatics requires the type of grit that Andrade has long found inspiring. “It can’t be easy,” she said.Andrade thought of Biles’s mental toughness in 2019, when her right ACL snapped a third time. Not even her coach expected her to attempt a third comeback. But she surprised him.“‘I’ve thought it over, and I’m not going to give up,’” she told Porath, according to the coach. “‘I’m going to try again.’”At the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics in 2021, she earned gold on vault and silver in the all-around competition, making her one of Brazil’s top sports starts. She looked for Biles. The American had bowed out of the games after suffering the twisties, a mental disconnect between mind and body. But even in that moment, Andrade could see the American athlete cheering her on.Andrade returned the affection, lauding Biles’s return to competition last year.“The best in the world was able to show us that things can happen, and you can get past it, and return,” Andrade said.Then: Last year’s world championships. For the first time, Andrade and Biles competing when both were healthy and in their prime. Biles won the all-around gold. Andrade earned silver.During the vault final, Biles fell on her Yurchenko double pike. Andrade landed her vault and snared the gold medal — and Biles’ imaginary crown.“Simone’s gesture showed that all of my work, all my effort, and everyone’s support, it was worth it,” she said. “I didn’t give up.”At an Olympic gymnastics facility in Rio de Janeiro this month, Andrade began training early — first floor, then bars, then beam. She was ready, she said.If both athletes perform at the peak of their abilities in Paris, the athlete’s team had concluded, Biles will win.“A Simone that sticks her landing is the champion,” Porath said.But if Biles stumbles, he continued, they’re prepared to capitalize. Andrade been practicing new skills. The Brazilian Olympic committee this month posted a video of the gymnast practicing a triple-twisting Yurchenko, an elaborate and dangerous twirl that has never been executed successfully in female competition.“We always train new things,” Andrade told The Post. “If we’re feeling good in the competition, we might do it.”Andrade wants to win. But mostly, she said, she wants to keep competing against Biles. Biles has not said publicly whether she will retire after this year’s games. But in a private conversation, Andrade said, Biles confided that Paris would be her final competition.“I said, ‘No, girl, don’t do this,’” Andrade said.When Andrade was at her lowest, Biles encouraged her to persevere. Now she wants to do the same for Biles.“I know that she wants to win, but she will continue rooting for me,” she said. “And she knows that I want to win, but I’ll keep rooting for her.”Emily Giambalvo contributed to this report."
WaPo_21,Maduro declared winner of disputed Venezuelan election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/28/venezuela-election-maduro-gonzalez/,2024-07-29 14:18:02.706314,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s electoral council declared the authoritarian socialist the winner of Venezuela’s election Sunday despite partial results and independent exit polling that suggested opposition candidate Edmundo González had captured twice as many votes.The Venezuelan opposition, which sent thousands of ordinary citizens to monitor voting centers across the country Sunday, swiftly rejected the results and said it had records showing a clear victory by González. The election outcome was immediately challenged by a host of foreign leaders, including U.S. officials.“We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,” said U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken. He called on the electoral council to publish the tabulation of votes. “It’s critical that every vote be counted fairly and transparently.”María Corina Machado, the face of the Venezuelan opposition campaign on behalf of González, said the opposition had received 40 percent of official printouts of voting center results, which showed González winning with 70 percent of the votes.“This is not one more fraud,” Machado said in a news conference at 1 a.m. local time. “This is a gross disregard and violation of popular sovereignty.”She stopped short of calling for protests but asked election observers and Venezuelan families to remain at voting centers well into the morning until all voting records arrive.The pro-government electoral council, delivering results shortly after midnight Monday, said Maduro won with 51 percent of the vote to González’s 44 percent.“I’m Nicolás Maduro, president-elect,” Maduro bellowed to a crowd of supporters outside the Miraflores presidential palace. “And I will defend our democracy, our law and our people.”The opposition had seen the election as its best chance in more than a decade to unseat the strongman, whom many here blame for this oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, hundreds of thousands of them to the United States. Maduro claimed reelection in a 2018 presidential vote that was condemned internationally as fraudulent and prompted a tightening of U.S. sanctions.In Caracas, the sounds of banging pots and pans echoed across buildings as soon as the results were announced — the sound of protest in Venezuela.“Maduro has a huge problem on his hands. If the government doesn’t actually back up the results with data, Maduro is inviting the biggest loyalty test he’s faced in years,” said Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who is focused on Venezuela. “This doesn’t end here. Maduro has to convince the ruling elite that he can keep things under control, but both he and the military know that he can’t govern a country in flames.”As votes were being counted, opposition leaders denounced what they said was a government order to voting-center workers to refuse to hand over printouts of voting results, which are used to corroborate the machine count, to opposition poll watchers.Delsa Solórzano, an opposition electoral council observer, decried a “concerning, widespread pattern.” Multiple voting centers had removed opposition witnesses, she said, and refused to transmit the results in the printouts.Elvis Amoroso, president of Venezuela’s electoral council, mentioned delays in transmitting results, and said he asked prosecutors to launch an investigation.Exit polling released after voting centers began to close Sunday evening showed González taking 65 percent of the vote, more than doubling Maduro’s 31 percent, according to Somerville, N.J.-based Edison Research.“Our fight continues, and we will not rest until the will of the people is respected,” González said in a news conference.As night fell, violence broke out at some polling centers. When opposition supporters at the Liceo Andrés Bello in Caracas complained of being denied access to the vote count, a colectivo — a gang of at least 150 Maduro supporters on motorbikes — arrived shouting pro-government chants.A Washington Post reporter saw the men, hooded and wearing black, begin to punch and kick those outside the polling center, injuring multiple people. “Viva Nicolás,” they shouted.Leiner González, caught in the middle, was beaten, and his shirt was ripped.“Please, we need change in Venezuela,” the first-time voter, 25, said, “so that there is no more violence in our beloved country from a group of criminals. We demand peace, freedom and truth. Please, we want a transition.”In the run-up to the vote Sunday, the government barred Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician, from running, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media.Sunday saw reports of blocked access at voting centers, delays and some violence. In Maturín, a state capital about 350 miles east of Caracas, local opposition leaders said a voting center coordinator and her mother were demanding access for opposition poll watchers when members of a colectivo rode up and shot the mother in the leg.Voting centers were scheduled to open 6 a.m. Sunday, but at a school in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas, a group of 18 people arrived three hours early. They would wait for more than six hours, amid delays opening some voting tables.By 9 a.m., some of the hundreds of people began to chant: “We want to vote!” Esther Pérez Villegas, whose husband was among those waiting, stepped in to help organize the lines. “Anxiety is high, very high, because of all of the uncertainty we feel,” she said.Noemi Tovar, 61, had been in line since 3 a.m. “If I have to wait all day, I’ll wait all day,” she said.“We’ve made lines here for many things — for food, for gasoline,” said Martha Salas, 62. “This is for so much more — for a vote.”Edison Research, which interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations, said González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.“Our exit poll projects a resounding victory for Edmundo González,” executive vice president Rob Farbman said. “The opposition candidate had broad support across nearly all demographic backgrounds.”In long lines at voting centers across Caracas, voters said they hadn’t seen such large crowds in an election in many years. The opposition described the turnout Sunday as “historic.”“I haven’t seen this kind of voter intention since Chávez,” said Vladimir Ramos, a 60-year-old engineer waiting in line. Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, founded Venezuela’s socialist state in 1999 and led it until his death in 2013.“I think people are no longer afraid,” said Natalie Moreno, 47.By 12:40 p.m., Maduro addressed the nation to announce the activation of Operation Remate — a word meaning “finish it off” — a government-led effort to rally supporters to the polls. Maduro campaign staff and supporters called people to pressure them to vote and offer food and supplies.“Let’s mobilize ourselves with force,” Maduro said in a message aired by state television. “Let’s vote with strength as was planned, and with the force of the” social programs.The government aid was flowing in the rural eastern state of Delta Amacuro. In an Indigenous community there, people were being offered bags of food in exchange of support, said Yoxsamar Jiménez, a poll watcher for the opposition.“But that’s normal here,” she said. More concerning, she said: Poll watchers were not allowed inside, and the center’s coordinator hit Jiménez.“To avoid violence, we couldn’t do anything so we had to leave the table,” Jiménez said. “The table is alone, and they’re doing whatever they want in that center.”González, a former diplomat, was unknown to most Venezuelans just months ago. But as the election loomed, polls predicted he could beat Maduro by double digits.He ran as a stand-in for longtime Maduro critic Machado, the “Iron Lady” who draws tens of thousands of Venezuelans to her near-messianic campaign caravans — and has been disqualified from running by Maduro’s supreme court.Her campaign focused on a simple message: Vote for us, and your loved ones can come home.“The central theme is family, in the sense that this could be the last opportunity to reunite our families,” she told The Post. “This is not just an electoral campaign. This is a redemption movement, for liberation.”Maduro’s campaign portrayed the opposition as an extreme, right-wing threat that would bring instability.Some voters in Caracas seemed to agree. Hector Trujillo, a 79-year-old retired architect, said he was voting for “peace” and the continued improvement of the economy. He blamed U.S. sanctions for the country’s troubles. He feared the opposition would “eliminate everything,” including the country’s welfare benefits.Ana Rosas, 26, voted Sunday for the first time in her life. Rosas, who now lives in El Salvador, is among the millions of Venezuelans dispersed across the world — and among the scores who returned home to vote.“I have goose bumps,” she said. “I still can’t believe I’m able to vote. I hope it makes a difference.”In Miami, dozens of Venezuelans, unable to vote from abroad, gathered at the Dolphin Mall to watch coverage of the election. Many wore shirts of red, yellow and blue, the colors of the Venezuelan flag, that read “Venezuela Libre.”“God willing, today the country will be free,” said Lennyn Padilla, 47, tears in his eyes. “I’m emotional because when I speak about it my throat closes up. It makes me so sad.”Victor Manuel Morina Parra, a 59-year-old bus driver in Caracas, said he has noticed discontent among his passengers. He moved from his farm in the countryside to the Catia neighborhood of the capital, he said, because his rural town was “in a state of total abandonment.”“We no longer have help from the government. There’s no fuel, the electricity goes out every eight hours,” he said. “That’s why we want change. For our children, for our grandchildren.”"
WaPo_22,"Alzheimer’s blood test shows 90% accuracy, outperforming other exams",https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/29/alzheimers-blood-test/,2024-07-29 15:48:02.779737,,"A new study shows that a simple blood test can outperform traditional exams when it comes to determining whether Alzheimer’s is responsible for memory problems, accurately diagnosing the disease about 90 percent of the time.Compare that with dementia specialists who successfully identified Alzheimer’s 73 percent of the time, while primary care doctors did so with a 61 percent rate, according to the study of 1,213 patients in Sweden that was published Sunday on JAMA, the journal published by the American Medical Association, and presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference on the same day in Philadelphia.The encouraging findings come amid larger efforts to develop a cheap, simple blood test that can quickly diagnose patients with Alzheimer’s without forcing people to undergo more expensive and invasive exams, such as spinal taps. Although blood tests are already used in clinics, they are often not covered by insurance, costing hundreds of dollars or more.“Overall, this is a nice addition to a rapidly growing literature, although not necessarily a game changer per se,” said Cliff Abraham, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of Otago in New Zealand who was not involved in the study.The study’s authors compiled data from patients with cognitive symptoms whose mean age was 74. About 23 percent of them had subjective cognitive decline, 44 percent mild cognitive impairment and 33 percent dementia.The authors measured the level of p-tau217, a type of protein that builds up and impairs the brain in Alzheimer’s patients, and amyloid beta, another protein that is considered a biomarker of Alzheimer’s.“It is clear, but not surprising, that the blood test offers better diagnostic accuracy than clinical evaluation, which has access to only indirect information about brain health, for example cognitive tests,” Abraham said.Alternatives for diagnosing Alzheimer’s include PET scans, which can cost $5,000 or more, and are not covered by Medicare except in trials, while spinal taps are invasive.The study adds to evidence that diagnosing Alzheimer’s could soon be done more quickly and easily. Faster and more accurate diagnoses allow patients and their families to better prepare for medical bills, enroll in clinical trials or anticipate care needs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, afflicting more than 6 million Americans. Although younger people can get Alzheimer’s, most patients are elderly, with the number of patients doubling every five years beyond age 65, according to the CDC. Up to 14 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s by 2060.The disease begins with mild memory loss but can progress to patients losing the ability to carry on a conversation. It is one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, with death rates climbing. There is no cure, although there are drugs that can slow the disease."

WaPo_25,Counties most in need of cardiologists are the most likely to have none,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/07/29/cardiologists-rural-counties-shortage/,2024-07-29 16:59:02.826759,,"Almost half the counties in the United States lack a single cardiologist, according to a new study that puts the decades-long rural health-care crisis into sharp relief.Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston looked at all 3,143 U.S. counties and found that just over 46 percent had no cardiologist, a finding senior author Haider J. Warraich called “truly shocking.”Compounding the problem, researchers discovered that risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking, diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure “were actually more prevalent in the counties that did not have a cardiologist,” said Warraich, who spent several months in 2019 moonlighting as the only cardiologist in rural Randolph County, N.C.Warraich said his work in Randolph County, which had a population then of more than 143,000, was “a powerful experience” that provided the impetus for the study published in the Journal of The American College of Cardiology.“I was essentially the only person there for those people,” he said.The lack of cardiologists in many counties places a greater burden on primary care doctors. But those same counties with a dearth of cardiologists also tend to have fewer primary care physicians, Warraich said.Counties without cardiologists have 41 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people, compared with 63 per 100,000 in counties with cardiologists.Warraich, who no longer works for Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said the study was not designed to determine whether the lack of cardiologists in areas translates into premature deaths, but “it can’t help,” he said.And some lines of evidence suggest that the lack of cardiologists in rural areas correlates with higher rates of severe disease and deaths.“There’s no question that the health statistics of rural America are worse than the health statistics of more urban America,” said Robert A. Harrington, dean of Weill Cornell Medicine, who has written on the crisis in rural health care. A 2021 study in JAMA showed the gap between urban and rural mortality rates widened considerably between 1999 and 2019, increasing more than 170 percent.One reason for the mortality gap, experts suspect, is the lack of cardiologists and other specialists in rural areas. The new study found that the vast majority of rural counties ― 86 percent ― have no cardiologist.The struggle to provide sufficient health care in rural America is not new.Since January 2005, 192 rural hospitals nationwide have closed or converted to facilities that do not provide inpatient care, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. George H. Pink, the program’s deputy director, said many factors have been driving the hospital closures, including declining populations in certain areas, large numbers of uninsured patients, outdated medical technology and severe financial struggles.“There’s a statement and I don’t know who said it, but I use it all the time: ‘Your Zip code tells more about your health outcomes than your genetic code,’ ” Harrington said. “And that’s certainly the case with rural America.”In few areas of medicine is the disparity as acutely felt as in heart disease. Almost half of all Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease, but many can be placed on effective treatments such as statin medications.“Most cardiovascular disease and death is preventable, and that is very different from a lot of other conditions,” Warraich said. “For example, with dementia, we don’t have great treatments, but with cardiovascular disease, we’ve got amazing treatments and many of them are cheap.”The Santa Monica, Calif., health-care company GoodRx acquired data and performed statistical analysis for the new study.The persistent shortage of doctors specializing in heart and blood vessel diseases burdens both patients and doctors.Stephen Sigal is one of two full-time cardiologists in Titus County, Tex., who a serve a four-county county area of about 3,000 square miles. Those four counties are part of a larger region in the northeast corner of Texas that is burdened by some of the highest levels of heart illnesses in the country. If this corner of Texas were a state, it would rank dead last in respiratory disease, second to last in strokes and near the bottom in heart disease.“It’s rare that I work less than 12 hours a day,” Sigal said. “It’s not uncommon that I work 16 to 18 hours in a day.”His hospital, Titus Regional Medical Center, is trying to recruit two more cardiologists. “I don’t know of any hospital in our region that isn’t recruiting cardiologists,” he said.The new study found that in counties with no cardiologist, patients averaged an 87-mile roundtrip drive when they needed to see one — far longer than the average 16-mile roundtrip for patients in counties with at least one cardiologist.Eldrin Lewis, a professor and chief of cardiovascular medicine at Stanford University, said he has patients who travel four hours one way just to reach him, a problem that’s magnified when it comes to referrals for follow-up care.“I felt helpless yesterday when I had a patient who was three hours away and needed physical therapy,” Lewis said. “The patient said, ‘There’s literally no one who does physical therapy near my home.’ ”One of Lewis’s long-distance patients, 72-year-old Lenore Tate, lives in Sacramento. Even in a city of more than half a million, Tate said, there are not enough cardiologists to meet the need. Tate, who suffers from congestive heart failure, said it is hard to make an appointment with a cardiologist, and if you have to reschedule, the wait can be up to six months.“It’s more than a hardship,” she said of the three-hour drive from her homes to Lewis’s office. “There are times I’ve had other illnesses and injuries that have made it difficult for me to get in my car and drive.”Usman Salahuddin, a cardiologist for Ochsner Rush Health in Meridian, Miss., a city of 34,000 people, said surrounding Lauderdale County has 11 other cardiologists. But there are none in the adjacent counties, which have a combined population of about 100,000.“It’s definitely challenging,” Salahuddin said, explaining that even in Meridian, “we don’t have cardiothoracic surgery or electrophysiology, specialty fields within cardiology. So we do the first triage assessment and then we, in turn, have to refer them out,” as far as Hattiesburg an hour and a half away, or even New Orleans, about three hours away. Electrophysiologists identify and treat irregular heart rhythms.“When I tell the family we have to refer the patient to, say Birmingham or New Orleans,” he said, “you can see them starting to think, ‘Oh, how will I logistically get there?’ ”Salahuddin, who went to medical school in his native Pakistan, said he received a special visa to train in the United States, which required that he spend three years working as a doctor in an underserved area. That’s how he came to Meridian.The visa program has helped officials begin to address the shortage of health-care specialists in rural and other underserved areas.To his surprise, Salahuddin has stayed a year beyond when he could have left. He has received his permanent residency card and said he enjoys being able to dine in a smaller community and find himself approached by a patient or family pleased with the care he provided.Salahuddin and others said the rise of telemedicine has mitigated to some degree the shortage of cardiologists in rural counties. A neurologist in New Orleans can use a laptop to view a stroke patient and family practitioner in a more remote area and determine whether the patient should receive clot-busters.But inconsistent broadband internet access limits access to telemedicine in some areas.Alexander Razavi, a cardiology fellow at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, said cardiologists may need to look beyond telemedicine to additional measures to reach rural communities. Cardiology practices that serve these areas, he said, might consider extending their hours or creating mobile examination units.“We need to invest and provide resources to these communities,” Razavi said."
WaPo_26,A ‘weird roller coaster ride’: Trump vs. Harris and America’s surreal summer,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/29/trump-harris-biden-campaign-summer-turmoil/,2024-07-29 16:59:02.826759,,"Kathleen Skelcy was freaking out. It was the Fourth of July and the summer that started with giddy vindication for her and many other Democrats — Donald Trump convicted on 34 felony counts — had turned into a nightmare.President Biden was facing calls to drop out after a disastrous debate. Trump’s odds of winning looked better by the day. The Supreme Court had just granted presidents sweeping immunity for “official acts,” renewing 72-year-old Skelcy’s worst fears about a second Trump term.“I feel like an extra in a slasher horror film right before everybody knows that somebody’s head is about to get lopped off,” the Democratic volunteer in battleground Michigan wrote in an agitated text as America celebrated its 248th birthday.The plot would only accelerate in the coming weeks, weaving through one unprecedented moment after another. A gunman would attempt to assassinate Trump. Democrats pushed Biden to leave the race. A normally sleepy stretch of the election year had suddenly become a remarkable chapter in future history books. It snapped voters in both parties to attention and put them on edge as they wondered: What could possibly come next?“It’s a weird roller coaster ride that we’ve been on,” Skelcy said last week as her party pinned their hopes on Kamala Harris. She was hopeful about Harris and her party’s prospects. But as she rattled off all the things she worried Trump would do if he won, the dread she felt a few weeks earlier wasn’t far away.A Trump-Biden rematch that often felt stale and static to many voters gave way this summer to a surreal stretch in which words like “extraordinary” and “shocking” at times seemed insufficient to describe what was happening. Republicans watched their nominee push past a historic felony conviction, dodge other charges and survive a campaign rally shooting. Democrats grew so alarmed about their chances that they swapped candidates weeks before their convention, rallying behind a vice president that some had long discounted.Now, a new sense of uncertainty hangs over the race, leaving historians reaching back to the political turmoil of 1968 for comparisons. Even some people who pay little attention to politics appear riveted, leaving campaign veterans remarking at the energy and engagement they are seeing on the ground before the traditional post-Labor Day surge of activity.Martha Zoller, a conservative radio host in Georgia, said even “normal,” nonpolitical friends were texting her about the election after Biden announced his withdrawal. “This is something that has broken through, that people understand,” she said.“This is a crazy cycle,” Zoller added. “All bets are off. There is no conventional wisdom in politics anymore.”“Obviously, the situation we find ourselves in today is totally uncharted territory and has no modern historical parallel,” Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio wrote in a strategy memo he released publicly last week.The turmoil of 2024 has parallels to 1968, scholars of presidential history said, an election year rocked by upheaval and violence. President Lyndon B. Johnson said in March of that year he wouldn’t seek reelection amid poor approval ratings; a leading Democratic candidate to replace him, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated a couple months later, not long after the murder of civil rights luminary Martin Luther King Jr. And Democrats’ convention in Chicago devolved into chaos as police clashed violently with antiwar protesters.Democrats will be back in the same city for their convention next month and party leaders are bracing for major protests over the Israel-Gaza war.Michael Cohen, author of “American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division,” said that for a long time he thought the current election was “kind of boring,” because so much of the electorate seemed locked into their views of the candidates. That feeling evaporated about a month ago with Biden and Trump’s debate.A race that had chugged along steadily for months — even in the face of Trump’s criminal trial —  slipped away from Biden almost overnight after he struggled through the debate, appearing to repeatedly lose his train of thought. All of the simmering concerns voters had expressed about the 81-year-old’s age and acuity quickly boiled over.Democrats began to openly revolt. Biden at first resisted their calls to drive him from the race. But after reviewing dismal internal polling, he bowed out on July 21 and endorsed Harris. The rest of the party quickly rallied behind her.Now Trump and Harris are locked in a tighter race, with polls showing the vice president doing better than Biden in head-to-head matchups. Harris’s campaign also raked in more than $200 million in less than a week. But Trump and his allies are working to magnify her vulnerabilities on issues such as the border, and some Democrats have worried that racism and sexism will work against a female candidate of color.There is no precedent for a presumptive nominee withdrawing as close to Election Day as Biden did and after winning the party’s primaries, Cohen said. There is also no precedent for a major party’s nominee being convicted of a felony — but with so much other news, Trump’s legal cases can feel to some political observers like an afterthought.“I almost forgot about that,” joked Barbara Perry, a professor at the University of Virginia who directs the presidential oral history program, when a reporter brought it up. A federal case against Trump was dismissed on July 15 in another dramatic twist.Patricia Poprik has watched this dizzying election play out on the ground in Bucks County, a suburban area in battleground Pennsylvania where Republicans just surpassed Democrats in registrations for the first time since they lost their edge in 2008. Poprik, the chair of the Bucks County Republican Committee, said seismic events like the attempt to assassinate Trump in Butler, Pa., have energized voters and brought some hesitaters back into the fold. Images of Trump pumping his fist moments after the shooting, blood on his face, are everywhere.“People at our headquarters, they were so angry,” she said recently. Supporters “wanted to do more.” Already, people she knew only tangentially were reaching out wondering how they could get mail ballots for their children heading to college.“This is not normal,” she said.The shooting was “too big for the folks who don’t normally pay attention to ignore,” echoed Sam DeMarco, the GOP chair in Allegheny County, Pa.Investigators are still trying to learn more about the shooter’s motive and say they have found little evidence of an ideology that drove him.Democrats said they are seeing a surge of enthusiasm, too, as Harris takes center stage — a woman of color two decades younger than Biden who would make history if elected. Pennsylvania Democrats say some 2,500 people signed up to volunteer in the first 24 hours of Harris’s campaign, quadruple their previous single-day record.John Brady said he got into the Philadelphia Democrats’ office about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday and found himself answering about two dozen phone calls before noon, most of them from Black Americans excited about Harris.“They want to know what they can do and when they can start, and can they start now, and my response, of course, is thank you, thank God,” said Brady, who serves as both the political director for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party and president of the Philadelphia Young Democrats.Later, he texted a reporter a meme that he said could sum up the whiplash Democrats have experienced. It’s pulled from a self-defense video in which an older man is robbed at knifepoint and pretends to double over with a heart attack, yelling, “Call the ambulance!”By the second frame, the old man has pulled a gun on his attacker. “But not for me!” he says.Other 21st-century elections were defined by some norm-shattering moments. The political rise of a celebrity businessman. The release of a tape in which he bragged about groping women. A pandemic that halted most campaigning and left the president hospitalized weeks before Election Day. In 2000, there was the recount that transfixed the country and handed the presidency to George W. Bush.Even so, 2024 stands out to many political veterans.“I would say that this stands on its own as the wildest reality television show you could watch,” said Ben Burnett, who hosts a conservative radio show in Georgia and often discusses the election."

WaPo_28,D.C.’s ‘pistol-packin’ preacher’ marks one year as police chief,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/29/pamela-smith-first-year-dc-police-chief/,2024-07-29 18:00:02.873582,,"A man was still firing bullets at police officers when the mayor called D.C. police Chief Pamela A. Smith.Muriel E. Bowser, the District’s mayor, told her chief that it was time to let the city know what was happening on this block of Hanna Place in Southeast Washington, where the man with the gun was barricaded with dozens of dogs inside of his home. Transparency was part of the job.Less than eight months into her role as the city’s top law enforcement officer, Smith decided to push back.“We’ve still got this person out here,” Smith told Bowser, the mayor recalled in an interview. “We are going to have to wait a little while.”The disagreement, on Feb. 14 in the midst of a 13-hour standoff, reflected a shift in thinking atop the D.C. police department, which for nearly a generation had been helmed by leaders who rose up through the ranks and embraced public news conferences on high-profile incidents.A self-described “pistol-packin’ preacher” who served for 24 years with the U.S. Park Police, Smith has sought to reshape public expectations for the role during her first year in office — and is still finding her footing.Since she has taken over the department, violent crime in the District has fallen, mirroring a nationwide trend. Homicides are down roughly 25 percent, and robberies have plunged 39 percent compared to the same period in 2023, a year that ended with the most killings in a quarter-century.Still, polls show that many District residents continue to feel unsafe. And some have questioned why Smith has been less outspoken than her predecessors.“There were news conferences that affected the city, and she wasn’t there,” said Anthony Muhammad, chair of the 7th District’s citizens advisory council, a group that serves as a liaison between police and residents. “She’s still learning the community and how D.C. actually works.”In one particularly high-profile case this year — the fatal shooting in May of a 3-year-old girl during a gun battle in Southeast D.C. — a district commander, rather than Smith, went to the scene to brief reporters, frustrating some residents who said it made them feel that crime in their community did not matter.Smith in an interview said she has worked hard to keep the community at the heart of decision-making.Over her first year, she won support from key political leaders and public safety officials, though at times frustrated her own staff. She has sternly told officers to spend more time out of their cars and has tweaked assignments so that they are focused on preventing robberies and patrolling higher-crime areas overnight. She has increased the frequency of crime briefings with command staff from once a week to daily. She has also overseen the opening of a surveillance monitoring center that police say has helped them make quicker arrests. Her perspective, she said, is that her job is to train her staff to respond to crime so that she can focus on structural changes, like how and when officers are deployed.In more than a dozen interviews with elected officials, community leaders and members of her department, observers described an approach that, in some ways, plays to the moment she is in.The anger and distrust in policing that manifested in D.C. and across the country after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd in May 2020 had mostly faded by the time Smith took over. In its place was an urgent fear of rising crime and, increasingly, agreement among residents and officialdom that more aggressive prosecution, detention and policing was required.In a city whose autonomy is subject to the whims of federal lawmakers, the loudest congressional voices on public safety have not come from those concerned about police abuse of power, but instead from Republicans who have argued that liberal policies have failed to keep people safe.Casting the District as ravaged by violence and run by unequipped liberals, House Republicans last year fueled a successful effort to block the D.C. Council’s revisions to the criminal code, marking the first time in 30 years that federal lawmakers overturned local legislation. President Biden signed the disapproval resolution, which also had support from some Democrats, saying he was concerned with a provision that would have lowered the statutory maximum penalty for carjacking.Since then, Biden, who has said he supports D.C. statehood, has stood between Congress’s will and the District’s autonomy — vetoing a congressional vote to block D.C.’s major police accountability legislation. But the posture of the Oval Office could change if former president Donald Trump is elected in November. He has threatened to “take over” the city, and Republicans in their national platform have said they will “reassert greater Federal Control” over the District “to restore Law and Order.” A battle over its independence would thrust the mayor — who has so far refused to say how she is preparing for the potential dynamic — and her chief into the spotlight.Over the last 12 months, Smith has shown herself to be a rousing orator when speaking from a pulpit and an expert connector when walking the streets — winning over residents who in interviews described her as honest, competent and warm. Before a TV camera, however, she has struggled, reading from scripts and sometimes fumbling for words. She is also still working to win over some officers, who are skeptical of a résumé largely built outside the department and have shown signs of frustration with her leadership.“Crime is down, but not because of her,” said a police supervisor who spoke on the condition of anonymity because department rules forbid police to contact media without permission.Morale has suffered under Smith because of a crush of overtime and weekend work, according to the supervisor and another police official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of department policy. As of late March, the department’s overtime spending for local initiatives was double what it was at that point last year, according to D.C. police data.Smith, asked if she had been fully embraced by the department, said she had and that “if it’s one or two people who are stirring the pot, it’s okay. I can’t be distracted.”The D.C. police union, which represents officers, did not respond to requests for an interview.Earlier this summer, even as crime was falling, rumors persisted for weeks that Smith was on her way out. The hearsay ultimately grew so loud that the chief proactively called a Washington Post reporter to reaffirm her commitment to the department.“Allow me to reiterate,” Smith said in a follow-up text message. “I am not leaving the MPD.”Earlier this month, The Post requested an interview with Smith to discuss her first year as chief. Bowser came, too.As they sat beside each other at the Wilson Building, Bowser, asked about Smith’s perception among officers, stood by her hire.“What I like is she is the people’s cop,” Bowser said. “Because that’s the job of the chief of police.”***Smith oversees a sworn staff of just under 3,300, the department’s lowest head count in at least a quarter-century, according to police data. The officers are responsible for the safety of the District’s roughly 690,000 residents, as well as for coordinating with dozens of federal agencies to staff motorcades and demonstrations around the National Mall. She earns a salary of $270,000 a year and lives in a section of Ward 8 that lies across the Anacostia River and was added to the ward through redistricting in 2021.Those responsibilities are a departure from what Smith oversaw as chief of the U.S. Park Police, a federal agency with a more narrow mandate focused on protecting monuments and visiting dignitaries.In her time with the Park Police, Smith moved between posts in San Francisco, New York and D.C., working as a K-9 officer at the Statue of Liberty and evaluating security at parks around the country. She left the agency in April 2022, just over a year after becoming chief, saying she was intrigued by a job offer from the D.C. police department to become chief equity officer, focused on ensuring diversity and inclusion. She soon became an assistant chief in charge of homeland security.Inside the Martin Luther King Jr. Library in July 2023, she introduced herself to the District. She would become the first Black woman to permanently lead its police department.“As a child I had no hopes, I had no dreams. They were far beyond my reach,” she said. “But I believe that all things are possible.”It had been a long and painful road to the podium where she stood.Her childhood in Pine Bluff, Ark., was shaped by an absent father addicted to cocaine and a mother who turned to alcohol and physical abuse to cope with the challenges of raising three children alone, she previously told The Post. Relief, she said then, came when she was almost grown and legally adopted by the pastor at her church.Over the last year, Smith has appeared most passionate when speaking about the District’s children — encouraging parents to be involved in their kids’ lives and engaging with teens at neighborhood events.Smith said in an interview that the hardest days in her first year as chief were when she bore witness to the agony of the children and teens she is tasked with keeping safe.One of the most excruciating cases came on a Friday night in May. Ty’ah Settles, 3, was riding in an SUV in Southeast D.C. when a gun battle erupted along Hartford Street. More than two dozen bullets flew. One struck the cheerful, chatty toddler, who was pronounced dead at a hospital soon after.It was the kind of horrific moment that recent police chiefs would have used to make a public point — like when Smith’s predecessor Robert J. Contee III stood before the press the day after 6-year-old Nyiah Courtney was gunned down in Southeast D.C. in 2021, raised his voice, and declared that he was “sick and tired of being sick and tired.”But that night at the scene of the crime, the first official words about the killing came from the commander of the 7th District station. Smith was not there, and the public noticed.She held a prayer walk days later. Then, she met with the girl’s family privately.Asked about her absence the night of the killing, Smith said she had trained her staff to step up and lead when necessary: “There are moments in my life, even as the chief of police, where there are other things that I am doing or other places where I have to be.”Joseph Johnson, who chairs the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for the area where Ty’ah was killed and is friends with her family, called Smith’s absence a slight. He said the family thought of the chief’s prayer walk as a mere photo op. A relative of Ty’ah did not respond to an interview request.“It sends a message that this is just another killing in an impoverished community,” Johnson said. “They just lost another child, and it’s just another day.”Smith has pledged to make police visibility a priority during her tenure. She has urged her staff to be more present, especially on foot, in neighborhoods — a change that residents confirm they have seen. And she committed the department to leading community safety walks in each district every week of the year. At many of them, the chief shows up.“She needed people to see her,” said Robert Pittman, a member of Smith’s 1st District citizen advisory council. “She needed people to understand, ‘I care. I’m here.’”In June, Smith stood in the basement of Washington National Cathedral, amid a crowd of about 50 people. They were there for Gun Violence Awareness Month. She was dressed in her uniform.Smith told parishioners about the moment last April when her mother, with whom she had reconciled later in life, died after a sudden illness.“My life was over,” Smith said. “Done.”She understood what it was like to lose someone.The chief broke out into a Christian hymn, talking about hope.Here was the pistol-packin’ preacher.Patrice Green, whose 23-year-old son Christopher Redfear was fatally shot in Southeast D.C. in 2016, watched the chief and then approached her. They spoke quietly for a number of minutes.The chief gave Green her card.Green said, “It really touched my heart.”***Federal and local public safety officials in Washington said Smith has been easy to work with on crafting and implementing policy. Unlike her predecessor, Contee, who felt he had to spend time in front of microphones advocating for the D.C. Council to shed policies he saw as too lenient, Smith has spent hers enacting and enforcing the more punitive policies that are now in place. Contee left the department last year for a job at the FBI that he said would allow him to spend more time with his family. The previous police chief, Peter Newsham, left his post in 2020 after four years amid nationwide protests against police violence and clashes with the D.C. Council over police funding and policy changes; Newsham said he did not leave because of the disagreements.The District’s most influential public safety officials — including Bowser, U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, and the Council’s public safety and judiciary chair Brooke Pinto — praised Smith in interviews this month, describing her as collaborative.Graves complimented her “data-driven” approach in considering officer deployment.He also said he was impressed by her leadership style. Soon after she was named chief, Graves said, Smith brought the former acting chief, Ashan Benedict, with her to a meeting, and let him lead it. The chief sat back, listening and learning.“I thought that was really impressive and showed a lot of confidence,” Graves said. “She didn’t need to be performative to show that she was the chief.”Schwalb said he finds Smith “responsive, professional and focused on getting results.”Mendelson described her as “able to show a lot of empathy,” which he said is important for building trust in communities.Pinto, who shepherded a massive public safety package that put D.C. on track toward harsher punishments for a range of crimes, called Smith “a great partner” in developing and implementing the law.Residents outside of D.C.’s halls of power, meanwhile, are still getting to know her.On a recent afternoon in Columbia Heights, people running errands had little to say about the chief, noting they were still forming an impression of her. Their focus was on crime.Saunya Connelly, 59, who has lived in the Mount Pleasant area for 15 years, said she has noticed public safety improve in the last year. “But there are still too many shootings and carjackings,” she said, “especially children getting caught in the crossfire.”Selena Williams, who lives several blocks from the Benning Road Metro station in Northeast and often hears gunfire, said she wanted to see more police on her street. But she expressed confidence in Smith, whose leadership style she described as straightforward and strong.“I’m grateful to have her as an example of a female leader,” Williams said.This month in Southeast Washington, a stray bullet struck yet another toddler. The little girl, who is 2, was wounded on a morning walk with her day-care classmates.This time, Smith addressed the cameras.“This was another example of gun violence that we cannot have in our communities,” she told reporters. “We are sick and tired of this.”She appeared to read largely from a script, measured and to the point.In her car on the way to visit the child, named Emily, at the hospital, Smith called a community activist, Jay Brown, Brown said. She sounded distraught, he recalled, and vowed she was doing everything she could to keep residents safe.“For the first time, I felt like she wasn’t being handled,” Brown said. “I felt like she was one of us."""
WaPo_29,"With Biden out and Harris in, down-ballot Democrats plot 2024 gains",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/house-senate-democrats-kamala-harris-down-ballot-congress/,2024-07-29 17:59:02.873582,,"Earlier this month, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) was nowhere to be found as President Biden quietly joked about his age and defiantly declared he would not let anyone “push me out of this race” at a low-key rally in her hometown of Madison.But just a few days ago, the two-term senator, who faces a tough battle for reelection this year in her swing state, was beaming as she spoke before Vice President Harris in front of a roaring crowd of re-energized Democrats in West Allis.The scene underscores the feeling of cautious optimism that is boosting Democratic candidates all the way down the ballot in the eight days since Biden stepped aside. Vulnerable Democratic incumbents hoping to hold onto their slim majority in the Senate and flip the House had all but resigned themselves to defeat after Biden’s disastrous debate, and they were running as far away from his candidacy as possible.Now that Harris has an opportunity to introduce herself to a Democratic base waked up by her candidacy, congressional Democrats are starting to see a path to victory with fewer than 100 days until Election Day, even as Republicans are organizing themselves around a line of attacks they hope will tie Democrats to Harris’s past positions.“We see huge energy everywhere,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who is running for reelection this year in Virginia, which some polls showed would be close on the presidential level with Biden atop the ticket. “In the events that I’ve done since that announcement, the energy is really, really ratcheting up.”Still, Harris is battling deep dissatisfaction with inflation and the administration’s handling of the border among voters, and Democrats are facing a brutal Senate map full of purple and red states that favors Republican attempts to wrest back control of the chamber. House Democrats have to win four more seats if all incumbents are reelected to retake the majority.“The additional enthusiasm that the Democrats have shown will obviously help down ballot races,” said GOP political consultant Whit Ayres. “Whether that will be enough to overcome the other negatives and challenges remains to be seen.”Democratic strategists running Senate and House campaigns noted an abrupt shift in messaging as soon as Biden, 81, passed the baton to Harris, 59, from an operation focused on the president’s record the last four years to a campaign leaning into the future with slogans like “We’re not going back.”Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who runs the Senate Democrats’ campaign arm, called the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, argued the contrast with Trump would be good for Harris and all Democratic candidates.“Campaigns are about the future. And how the policies they’re fighting for are impacting their lives,” Peters said. “That’s why I think it’s a real problem for Donald Trump he continually dwells on the past.”House Democrats also see the future-forward messaging as a welcome change. Multiple House Democratic lawmakers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about Biden’s troubles, said the president spent the last several weeks recounting his first-term accomplishments rather than laying out a concrete vision for the future.Democrats this week cheered on Harris as she embraced “freedom” as a core tenet, and they noted her sharper messaging compared with Biden on abortion rights and other issues.“We have an opportunity to move past the chaos and extremism and return to normal, pragmatic, reliable leadership, and [voters] get that with her. They get a better understanding of what’s on the line in terms of democracy and how we’re going to strengthen it,” Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) said. “It’s also an opportunity not just to say, ‘Here’s who I am,’ but to set the terms of the debate.”Over the past eight days, the once-depressed Democratic base has wake up, helping amass more money and a volunteer army down-ballot. The Harris campaign said Sunday that it had raked in $200 million in the week since Biden exited the campaign, two-thirds being from new donors.Earlier this week, the DSCC raised more than a million dollars online two days in a row, the most of the cycle, according to the group. And Peters said the number of statewide volunteers in his state doubled in the four days since Harris announced her candidacy.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had its best day of the cycle in the first 24 hours after Biden’s announcement and one of the best online fundraising days in the House Democratic campaign arm’s history, raising nearly $1 million, they said. In the first nine hours after Biden’s Sunday announcement, the DCCC was raising $1,300 per minute, according to the DCCC.“I love Joe Biden, but I think it’s a fact that we were having a difficult time activating our base. We have that problem solved,” Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.) said.The latest influx of cash is something keeping Republicans up at night because it can take some districts off the competitive map, according to GOP campaign strategists.“Knowing the path forward has folks incredibly energized, and frankly, our candidates have always been running ahead, so we’ve been on a good path to take back the House from the beginning of the cycle and continue to date,” DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) said.Both a Siena/New York Times poll and a Wall Street Journal poll published this week showed Harris faring better than Biden among young, Hispanic and Black voters — all key constituencies for Democrats up and down the ballot this fall. But the Siena poll also registered some slippage compared with Biden among older voters, showing the rapidly shifting coalitions that Democrats are still deciphering. An ABC/Ipsos poll released Sunday showed an eight-point spike in Harris’s favorability rating from 35 to 43 percent, with an unfavorable score of 42 percent.Harris’s strengths have presidential strategists hoping that Sun Belt states including Nevada, Arizona and Georgia may be back in play after the Biden campaign had begun to write them off. That is welcome news for Democrats running for the Senate there: Rep. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (Nev.). Democrats also believe Harris’s candidacy will help incumbents in the “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states Democrats historically have won to secure the White House.House and Senate Democrats running in swing districts and states had been outperforming Biden before his exit from the campaign — strategists said they continued to do so in the weeks after the June 27 debate.But Democratic lawmakers feared that if Biden stayed on the ticket, he would eventually doom their chances down-ballot. They worried that Democrats were unlikely to hold onto the Senate if Biden lost, given the fact that even if all their incumbents win, the Senate would be split 50-50 next year. (The president’s party gains control of the Senate in the case of a split.) House Democrats also were concerned that a depressed base would result in historically low voter turnout, which is critical in swing districts where elections are determined at the margins.“I think the dynamic for them has improved simply because it’s not Biden,” said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). “We still are trying to catch up in some of the swing states in the Senate races.”In the red states of Ohio and Montana, where Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester, respectively, are fighting for their political lives, it is less clear that Democrats will be aided by Harris at the top of the ticket. Tester is the lone vulnerable Senate incumbent who has not endorsed Harris, even though the Los Angeles Times reported in 2015 that he encouraged her to run for Senate in the first place.“He’s doing his best to try and get himself aligned with his state, which is going to be really hard because his state is a far cry from the kind of San Francisco liberal policies that Harris brings to the ticket,” said John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican.National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines (R-Mont.) said he believed that Harris will eventually help Republican candidates because it’s easier to connect Democrats to her policy positions, which he cast as far left, than to connect them to Biden’s age.“She is a San Francisco radical, and this just feels a lot like a replay of George McGovern and Michael Dukakis,” Daines said, referencing past failed Democratic presidential nominees. “The nation is not ready for a far-left president.”That messaging is being used by Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate David McCormick, who released an online ad targeting Sen. Bob Casey (D). In the ad, Casey praises Harris before a lengthy supercut of Harris previously endorsing policies such as banning fracking and discussing “starting from scratch” in designing the agency charged with enforcing immigration law inside the United States.  In a memo, the NRSC urged candidates not to “be shy about aggressively tying their opponents to Kamala Harris’ extreme agenda.” (The Harris campaign told reporters this week she now does not support a fracking ban.)In the House, swing-district Democrats have largely embraced Harris’s candidacy, with many believing she can only improve on her support from here. One House Democrat representing a swing district said they called on Biden to step aside because they had seen 30 months of consistent internal polling that showed Biden not improving against Trump.“I saw Biden’s ceiling and I think what we see in the polling is Harris’s floor,” said the lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about party leaders.Democratic Rep. Hillary J. Scholten, who represents a swing district in western Michigan, says she has had many “moderate, even conservative crossover voters” in her district who mention liking Harris’s personality and gravitas, and who consider her a politician “who really means business.”But Democrats say Harris must use this opportunity to reintroduce herself to a public that does not know much about her as Republicans are sharpening their attacks.Many swing district Democrats — which represent districts with an almost evenly split mix of Democratic, Republican, and independent voters — are telling Harris’s campaign that she needs to run to the center rather than appeal to the far left.“You’re in the general now. If Democrats are going to give you the path, you need to run like you understand what it takes to win in a battleground state,” the Democratic House member said. “If you all go off to the left and try to please the ‘Bernie bros,’ you got a problem in battleground states.”Democrats welcomed Harris latching onto her prosecutorial record to sharply contrast with Trump’s recent felony conviction. Many noted that such an embrace could help them counter GOP attacks that Democrats are soft on crime.It’s a difference from the Harris 2020 presidential campaign in which she often times softened her record as a prosecutor and attorney general of California in fear of disappointing the liberal base during a crowded Democratic primary.But Hill progressives are also embracing Harris as a candidate who will continue liberal policies that Biden enacted during his presidency. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was asked by the campaign to stump for Harris in Georgia this weekend. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said Harris’s past positions on climate, abortion and the war in Gaza will continue to excite liberals, especially young voters. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he will do “anything” he can to help elect Harris, but he has not yet formally endorsed her.It’s exactly what Republicans want to capitalize on.“That San Francisco liberal wants to turn the whole country into San Francisco,” said National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) at a Trump rally in North Carolina last week. He added that Harris “wants more illegal immigration, she wants free health care for illegals, she wants to defund the police.”But Harris has brushed off these attacks, portraying a vote for Trump as a ticket to the past. “We’re not going back,” she said in Wisconsin last week, as the crowd began chanting the same.Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report."

WaPo_31,How Kamala Harris’s early career prepared her for this moment,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-california-career-prosecutor/,2024-07-29 17:59:02.873582,,"SAN FRANCISCO — Lateefah Simon arrived for her first day at the top cop’s office in her usual outfit of tracksuit and Pumas, ready to work with young men who were fresh out of prison. Her new boss — the woman who persuaded her to trade her career as a high-profile activist and organizer for a job in the district attorney’s office — wasn’t having it.“You’re working in government, and government is about service, so you never dress down for your people,” Kamala Harris, then San Francisco’s chief prosecutor, sternly told Simon. “Go home and come back tomorrow in a suit.”Simon, who is now running for Congress to represent California’s East Bay, said the scolding was “my first taste of Boss Kamala, not Mentor Kamala.” It was an early example, nearly 20 years ago, of Harris’s exacting standards. Simon left her office chastened.Yet when she walked into work the next day, clad in business casual clothes hastily borrowed from friends, Harris presented her with a shopping bag. Inside were a newly purchased gray pantsuit and a scarf embroidered with an “L” for Lateefah.“She made it her business to make me better professionally and politically,” Simon recounted this week.To her, the story illustrates the two sides of Harris: A hard-driving, demanding public servant, who also displayed compassion and kindness behind closed doors, especially with young people, whether they were on her staff or victims of a crime. Those traits helped Harris navigate the notoriously cutthroat world of Bay Area politics, where she rose from intern to district attorney in little more than a decade, building a career that has taken her to the heights of American government.As Harris assumes the role of Democrats’ likely presidential nominee, those who worked with her and campaigned against her in California say her time in the crucible of her hometown’s politics could be both blessing and burden come November.Oakland and San Francisco shaped her political instincts, but despite a rich history of producing powerful leaders, the Bay Area has never bred a U.S. president. Indeed, while California has sent several Republicans to the White House, no Democrat from this state has been elected to the nation’s highest office.In the days since President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris, conservatives have quickly revived old tropes, tagging her as a “San Francisco liberal” and a “California socialist.” Simon and others say Harris’s early career prepared her to parry such attacks, like an attorney handling cross-examination.“Every single day of my time with Kamala Harris, I saw not only her rigor and how hard she worked but also how people constantly discounted her and she refused to be anything less than excellent,” he said. “That’s the Kamala who is going to be president of the United States.”Harris was born in Oakland and raised in a house on Bancroft Way in the formerly redlined Berkeley flatlands. It was from this home that she was bused to an elementary school in the city’s wealthy hills as part of an integration program.She was 12 when her family left Berkeley for Canada, where her mother taught at McGill University. There, Harris met a friend whose story of abuse would motivate her to become a prosecutor, and when she returned to the Bay Area, it was to study law.She got her start as an intern in the Alameda County district attorney’s office, a coveted post in an agency with a storied list of alumni, including former U.S. Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren. Her time there was transformative, Harris wrote in her memoir, “The Truths We Hold.” She recalled helping free an innocent woman who was swept up in a drug bust, a victory she characterized as “a defining moment in my life.”She landed a full-time job in the office and was eventually assigned to a unit that prosecuted sex crimes, where her team supervisor, Nancy O’Malley, remembers her displaying “an amazing ability to connect with people,” especially young victims of sexual violence.O’Malley still thinks about one of Harris’s cases, which involved prosecuting a group of young men who had gang-raped a 14-year-old in foster care. The girl, whose testimony would be key to securing a conviction, was wary of the attorneys. But Harris took her hand, comforting and reassuring her.“What Kamala did was make that girl feel like she was the queen of the world,” O’Malley said. “I will never forget watching their interaction, and this young woman transformed before my eyes.”Harris remembers the case, too. She won a conviction, she wrote in her memoir, but later heard a rumor that the young victim had fallen back into a cycle of abuse. “It was hard not to feel the weight of the systemic problems we were up against,” Harris acknowledged.In her telling, the case planted a seed, forcing her to consider policy changes that might disrupt patterns of violence. Others believe she always aspired to higher office.“She was ambitious,” O’Malley said. “She always had her sights set higher than where she was, appropriately so.”The DA’s office in Alameda County had a deep bench — including O’Malley, who would eventually become the first woman to hold the top job. But across the Bay Bridge, the path to power appeared easier. And in 1998, Harris accepted a job at the San Francisco district attorney’s office.Still, her first political campaign five years later was bruising and difficult.She was the underdog against her former boss, the incumbent DA Terence Hallinan, as well as longtime prosecutor Bill Fazio. The contest resurfaced a sensitive subject, Harris’s brief romantic relationship with former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker.The two had broken up years earlier, but Brown supported Harris’s candidacy, and her critics accused her of benefiting from political patronage. According to her then-campaign consultant, Harris came up with an effective counter. Answering a question at a candidate forum about her independence, she highlighted scandalous accusations made about her two opponents before promising to run a positive, issue-focused campaign.“She knows how to play politics way better than I ever did,” Fazio, now a Harris supporter, said. “She thinks on her feet, and trial attorneys have to do that because you never know what’ll come next. She’s smart, she’s bright, she’s aggressive.”Early on, Harris branded her approach “smart on crime” in an attempt to balance law enforcement and liberal values. She opposed capital punishment and called herself a “progressive,” yet the San Francisco Chronicle’s endorsement still declared she was “for Law and Order.”Harris won, and she and Fazio eventually became friendly, bonding over the loss of their mothers, who died within months of each other. He remembers her as a tough prosecutor and said the Brown attacks — then and now — are “nonsense” that would never dog a male candidate.In her first years at the DA’s office, Harris increased the conviction rate but also began taking her first real political heat. In 2004, a San Francisco police officer was killed in the line of duty, and soon after Harris announced she would not seek the death penalty against the perpetrator, infuriating police officers and other elected officials. In an op-ed, Harris maintained her position, writing that “there can be no exception to principle.”She then drew criticism from the left when she instituted a policy punishing parents of truant children with fines and possible jail time, though the latter penalty was never applied and truancy rates fell. Her office was also plunged into scandal after accusations that she had violated the rights of defendants by covering up the misconduct of a police lab technician. Harris later said she wasn’t aware of the problems but took responsibility as head of the office.Louise Renne, who hired Harris to work in the city attorney’s office before her run for DA, said the vice president is part of an illustrious line of barrier-breaking San Francisco women, including former U.S. senator Dianne Feinstein, who died in September, and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took hits from right and left but “knew how to stand their ground and be firm.”Harris is far more moderate than either side gives her credit for, Renne said. As district attorney, “Kamala was looking at being very practical,” she said. “People don’t understand that.”During her second term as DA, Harris announced a bid for California attorney general. The move would take her out of San Francisco and position her more squarely in the national spotlight. As she advanced, some faulted her for being too cautious and often avoiding controversial issues, especially pressing criminal justice matters, said Dan Morain, author of the biography “Kamala’s Way.” Critics said the approach undercut her claims of bold leadership.Even then, however, her opponents knew she would be a formidable force for years to come. In the 2010 AG race, Republicans — more successful in the state than now — picked a strong candidate to oppose her and poured millions into the contest. They viewed it, Morain said, as their last chance to stymie a promising career.“If they had beat her in 2010, she would probably be a lawyer at some fancy San Francisco law firm … but that didn’t work and here we are,” he said. “They saw in her a rising star.”"
WaPo_32,The U.S. men’s gymnastics team tried to reinvent itself. Will it work?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/us-mens-gymnastics-difficulty-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 17:51:02.873582,,"PARIS — At the previous Olympics, the U.S. men’s gymnastics team hardly had a chance. Because of the low difficulty of its routines, even an extraordinary performance probably wouldn’t have been enough to earn a team medal. The athletes acknowledged that gloomy reality as soon as the competition in Tokyo concluded. Then the familiar finish became the impetus for change.To vie for medals, the program had to reinvent itself.“There was no way we were going to be able to get on the podium if we didn’t increase our difficulty,” said Brody Malone, the reigning all-around national champion and the lone returning Olympian on the Paris team. “It just wasn’t going to happen.”For the Americans, fourth- and fifth-place finishes had become the norm, and they left Tokyo with zero medals. Over the past three years, the U.S. gymnasts have aggressively pushed to increase the difficulty of their routines, and they enter Monday’s team final seeking their first Olympic team medal since 2008.The U.S. team qualified for the final in fifth place after Malone struggled on multiple apparatuses, casting doubt on whether this group will earn that breakthrough medal. The Americans’ potential, which is much greater than what they showed Saturday, offers some reassurance. China and Japan, a pair of powerhouse teams, are still far above the field, but the U.S. men could push past Britain and Ukraine by cleaning up the mistakes from the qualifying round. None of the scores from Saturday carry over to the team final.The British men earned the third-best qualifying score with an excellent performance, but U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said, “I think if we put it all together, we’re right there with them.”A podium finish would validate a years-long effort to catch up with the world’s best. The Americans haven’t fully closed the gap and the absence of Russia is a key reason the U.S. men have a realistic chance of landing in third, but a medal would prove the program has progressed.Scores combine difficulty, which is open-ended and increases as routines become more complex, and execution, which starts with a perfect 10 and goes down with mistakes. At the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, the Americans missed out on medals after errors derailed their performances. Both times, they qualified to the final in medal position, then failed to deliver when it counted. So then the program emphasized consistency, and gymnasts gravitated toward easier routines they could reliably hit. The widening gap in difficulty quickly became glaring.The program set out to reverse this trend by incentivizing athletes to attempt harder skills. Major competitions are the best judge of how well that plan has worked.The Americans won a team bronze at the world championships last fall, their first medal in nearly a decade, and in the final, they earned a combined difficulty score that was just 2.4 points behind gold medalist Japan and less than a point behind silver medalist China — a massive improvement from the five-point disadvantage the U.S. men faced from 2018 to 2021. A fall incurs a one-point deduction, so that edge gave the other teams considerable room for error.At the world championships in 2018, the U.S. men had the best execution in the field, but it didn’t matter because they were so far behind in difficulty. They finished fourth. Last year, the Americans showcased a more complex repertoire of routines and performed with execution that was nearly as strong as China and Japan. They won the bronze medal with nearly three points separating them from fourth-place Britain. Heading into the Paris Games, that performance proved an Olympic medal was possible.“We broke the drought once,” said Paul Juda, one of three U.S. Olympic team members who competed at worlds last year. “We’ve got so many returners that are going to have the exact same mindset, and it’s way cooler to come back with a medal, that’s for sure.”During the qualifying round in Paris, Japan (108.4) and China (108.3) had the highest difficulty scores based on the top three marks on each apparatus. The United States was farther behind at 104.2, but if the American gymnasts replicated their best performances from recent competitions, they could climb above 106.The looming asterisk is that Russia, the reigning Olympic champion, was not at last year’s world championships and is not competing as a team in Paris. Amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the International Gymnastics Federation banned Russia from competing at the events that determined which teams qualified for the Olympics. So if the United States repeats its showing from worlds and wins a bronze medal here, the unanswered question is whether the Americans will remain in medal contention whenever Russia returns to the field.“I’m a strong believer of all that matters is that competition that you’re at,” said Syque Caesar, the coach of two Olympic team members, Malone and Stephen Nedoroscik. “And if you’re not at that competition, it doesn’t matter. … Russia’s nonexistent to me. Right now in gymnastics, they’re a non-threat.”A silver medal would remove doubt, but that seems unlikely unless China or Japan has major trouble.When the U.S. program implemented a bonus system in 2022 — a radical plan that had the ability to significantly alter the results of competitions — the national team staff believed athletes needed an incentive to attempt harder elements. When gymnasts debut skills, they might do so with weaker execution, which brings down their score. The bonus points tilted the risk-vs.-reward calculus in favor of difficult routines. It gave gymnasts freedom to experiment without worrying as much about how low scores could hurt their chances of earning spots on the national team, which provide funding.Two years ago, Frederick Richard, now a star of the Olympic team, had just learned a tricky release element on high bar. Usually, a gymnast might not opt to include such a new skill in his competitive set, but with the bonus system, Richard said the boost he received counteracted the risk of a one-point deduction for a fall. He performed the skill at the national championships and caught it both days of competition. It has been in his routine ever since.“We really can push the envelope at times like that earlier in the quad,” Richard said. “And it shows now.”"

The researchers estimated the numbers of cases and deaths related to modifiable risk factors for 30 types of cancers.Risk factors identified included smoking cigarettes, secondhand smoke, excess body weight, alcohol consumption, consumption of red and processed meat, low fruit and vegetable consumption, ultraviolet radiation and infection with cancer-related viruses.An estimated 40 percent of incident cancer cases and 44 percent of deaths were attributed to modifiable risk factors. Cigarette smoking was the leading risk factor, contributing to 19.3 percent of cancer cases and 28.5 percent of deaths. Excess body weight was also a major risk factor, contributing to 7.6 percent of cancer cases. Other leading risk factors for cancer cases included alcohol consumption (5.4 percent), UV radiation exposure (4.6 percent) and physical inactivity (3.1 percent).The researchers also looked at the relationship between some types of cancer and risk factors. Lung cancer had the most cases and deaths that could be attributed to risk factors in both men and women. Skin melanoma, colorectal cancer and urinary bladder cancer also had a high proportion of cases attributable to risk factors.“Large numbers of cancer cases and deaths in the United States are attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors, underscoring the potential to substantially reduce the cancer burden through broad and equitable implementation of preventive initiatives,” the researchers write.This article is part of The Post’s “Big Number” series, which takes a brief look at the statistical aspect of health issues.

WaPo_35,"Biden endorses Supreme Court reforms, amendment to limit immunity",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/biden-supreme-court-reform-ethics-code-term-limits/,2024-07-29 17:29:02.873582,,"President Biden endorsed sweeping changes to the Supreme Court on Monday, calling for 18-year term limits for the justices and a binding, enforceable ethics code for the high court.He is also pushing for a constitutional amendment that would prohibit blanket immunity for presidents, a rebuke of the Supreme Court after it ruled this month that former president Donald Trump is immune from prosecution for official acts.For Biden, who has long resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court, the announcement Monday marked a major shift in his posture toward one of America’s three branches of government. Since assuming the presidency, the Supreme Court has veered sharply to the right — overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in college admissions, weakening federal agencies’ power by overturning a 40-year decision and striking down Biden’s student-loan forgiveness program.“I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today,” Biden wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post published Monday morning. “I have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers. What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.”The president will officially announce his support for the changes during a speech commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin The Post previously reported that Biden was set to call for these three changes.The calls, however, are largely aspirational at this stage given the long odds they face in implementation. Term limits and an ethics code are subject to congressional approval, and the Republican-controlled House is unlikely to support either. Both proposals also require 60 votes to pass the Senate, and Democrats only hold 51 seats in the upper chamber. Passing a constitutional amendment requires clearing even more hurdles, including two-thirds support of both chambers, or via a convention of two-thirds of the states, and then approval by three-fourths of state legislatures.Biden’s proposed amendment, which Biden is calling the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” states the “Constitution does not confer any immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction, or sentencing by virtue of previously serving as president.”In his op-ed explaining his decision, Biden wrote, “This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one.”The Supreme Court immunity decision, which came along ideological lines, made it extremely unlikely that Trump would go to trial on charges of trying to subvert the 2020 election before voters cast ballots in this year’s presidential contest.Less than an hour after that decision, Biden called Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, to discuss the ruling and the arguments for and against remaking the court. The next week, Biden called Tribe again, and the two discussed a Guardian opinion piece he wrote endorsing reforms to the Supreme Court. Among the options they discussed: term limits, an enforceable ethics code and the constitutional amendment to address presidential immunity.Tribe confirmed that he spoke with Biden but declined to comment on their discussion.Biden’s call for an enforceable ethics code follows a year of scandals at the Supreme Court, largely centered on Justice Clarence Thomas and his lack of disclosures over gifts. Justice Samuel Alito has also come under criticism for flying politically provocative flags at his homes.Biden wrote that the ethics codes should require justices to “disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.”The term limits, Biden said, would allow future presidents to appoint a justice every two years and make high court nominations “more predictable and less arbitrary.” He noted that the United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime appointments to its high court justices.After The Post first reported on Biden’s proposals, former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, criticized the president’s plan.“The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court,” he wrote on Truth Social. “We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country.”During the 2020 presidential race, Biden rebuffed calls from liberals who advocated expanding the court but he promised he would create a commission to study potential changes. He followed through on that vow after being elected, and the commission issued a 294-page report to the president. Before Monday, Biden had not acted on the commission’s report since it was approved in December 2021.Biden had been planning to endorse the changes to the high court, even before he last weekend announced he was reversing course and not seeking a second term as president. Biden hinted about his plans during a call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a call that was part of his unsuccessful effort to keep Democrats united behind his candidacy.“I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out — I don’t want to prematurely announce it — but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court. … I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” Biden said, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The Post."
WaPo_36,Joe Biden: My plan to reform the Supreme Court and ensure no president is above the law,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/,2024-07-29 17:00:02.873582,,"The writer is president of the United States.This nation was founded on a simple yet profound principle: No one is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not a justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. No one.But the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision on July 1 to grant presidents broad immunity from prosecution for crimes they commit in office means there are virtually no limits on what a president can do. The only limits will be those that are self-imposed by the person occupying the Oval Office.If a future president incites a violent mob to storm the Capitol and stop the peaceful transfer of power — like we saw on Jan. 6, 2021 — there may be no legal consequences.And that’s only the beginning.On top of dangerous and extreme decisions that overturn settled legal precedents — including Roe v. Wade — the court is mired in a crisis of ethics. Scandals involving several justices have caused the public to question the court’s fairness and independence, which are essential to faithfully carrying out its mission of equal justice under the law. For example, undisclosed gifts to justices from individuals with interests in cases before the court, as well as conflicts of interest connected with Jan. 6 insurrectionists, raise legitimate questions about the court’s impartiality.I served as a U.S. senator for 36 years, including as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today. I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers.What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.That’s why — in the face of increasing threats to America’s democratic institutions — I am calling for three bold reforms to restore trust and accountability to the court and our democracy.First, I am calling for a constitutional amendment called the No One Is Above the Law Amendment. It would make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office. I share our Founders’ belief that the president’s power is limited, not absolute. We are a nation of laws — not of kings or dictators.Second, we have had term limits for presidents for nearly 75 years. We should have the same for Supreme Court justices. The United States is the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime seats to its high court. Term limits would help ensure that the court’s membership changes with some regularity. That would make timing for court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary. It would reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come. I support a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court.Third, I’m calling for a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court. This is common sense. The court’s current voluntary ethics code is weak and self-enforced. Justices should be required to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Every other federal judge is bound by an enforceable code of conduct, and there is no reason for the Supreme Court to be exempt.All three of these reforms are supported by a majority of Americans — as well as conservative and liberal constitutional scholars. And I want to thank the bipartisan Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States for its insightful analysis, which informed some of these proposals.We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power. We can and must restore the public’s faith in the Supreme Court. We can and must strengthen the guardrails of democracy.In America, no one is above the law. In America, the people rule."

The theater no long tours in Europe and America. And its longtime director resigned last year and was replaced with a staunch Putin loyalist, after publicly admitting that its repertoire was censored to remove works by directors or choreographers who criticized the Ukraine invasion.The Bolshoi is hardly the only iconic Russian institution under pressure. The longtime directors of Moscow’s Tretyakov and Pushkin fine art museums were also replaced.Musicians, actors and writers who oppose the war are being hounded into exile or driven underground — while artists remaining in Russia are compelled by the government to echo a new nationalist zeal in their work. Those who actively voice support for the war are rewarded with fame and fortune. Movies or music glorifying the army or upholding patriotic values receive hefty government subsidies.President Vladimir Putin’s push to re-engineer his country as a militarized superpower in conflict with liberal Western values is sterilizing Russia’s once-vibrant cultural landscape, artists say. By demanding that the new turbocharged patriotism pervade everything from fine art exhibits to rap music to ballet performances, the Kremlin is stifling creativity and squashing free expression.
The changes represent the starkest shift since the 1930s, when the Soviet Union, under Joseph Stalin, adopted socialist realism as its official cultural doctrine — requiring artists to depict and promote Marxist-Leninist ideals in every form of their work.
“I am afraid what we are witnessing now may be the end of Russia as we have known it, the end of the cultural phenomenon that is associated with the term ‘Russian culture,’” the acclaimed Russian detective novelist Grigory Chkhartishvili — better known by his pen name, Boris Akunin — said in an interview from London, where he now lives.A prominent theater critic said that a Soviet relic — the assignment of a curator from the KGB to control what gets onstage — has made a comeback, and major theaters now have minders from the FSB, the KGB’s main successor.“Everyone has a curator,” the critic said. “We are fully returning to the 1930s era of control and censorship.”A department within Russia’s Interior Ministry, known as Center E — named for its official task of countering extremism — plays a crucial role in the state’s control over the arts and often sends agents to sit among spectators at performances, according to musicians and directors.For this article, The Washington Post interviewed more than a dozen writers and artists whose lives and work have been upended by the sweeping changes. Most who agreed to speak did so on the condition of anonymity because of the risk of retribution.After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the state’s grip tightened, with tough laws barring any criticism of the war.“The theaters themselves all of a sudden rushed to sign nonaggression pacts with the likes of the prosecutor general’s office, seeking immunity, staging plays for the soldiers and their kids,” said Nikita Betekhtin, a prominent Russian director who compiled a list of dozens of theaters that put the military’s Z symbol on their facades and playbills to cater to the authorities.In 2022, the Yermolova Theater company in Moscow boasted on its website that it had signed an agreement “on mutual creative cooperation” with the Investigative Committee, Russia’s most powerful law enforcement body.Betekhtin departed Russia in May 2022 after two of his plays were canceled; he now directs plays in Berlin. “Center E and FSB are incompatible with culture, but as they try to control it, we see all these Kafkaesque processes,” he said.At the Bolshoi, home to the storied ballet company, the longtime director, Vladimir Urin, was replaced by Valery Gergiev, a Putin loyalist who also runs the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. Urin had supported Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 but signed a petition opposing the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Gergiev, by contrast, has long been an unequivocal supporter of Putin and had an engagement at La Scala in Milan cut short when he refused to condemn the war.Standing with Putin at a Kremlin awards ceremony in May, Gergiev said that while the Bolshoi and Mariinsky perform Mozart and Verdi at times, their emphasis must be on Russian composers: Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky, Rachmaninoff, Glinka and Tchaikovsky. “The power of these greatest creators — it is absolutely unstoppable, it has no barriers, it has no borders,” Gergiev said, echoing Putin’s expansionist rhetoric.1/5
Some Bolshoi dancers support the war through an internal Telegram group that raises money for soldiers. But with virtually no access to the major theaters worldwide, their careers are stagnating.
“Their global reputation is diminishing and now the theater has been forced to become more political,” said Alexei Ratmansky, a choreographer and director whose work was censored. “If you don’t prove that you’re on Putin’s side, your position is questioned.”
Museums also feel the tightening grip. Zelfira Tregulova, who since 2015 had overseen a refresh of the staid Tretyakov, was ousted following a complaint over the gallery’s “destructive ideology.” Her successor is a woman with links to the FSB.A few weeks after Tregulova left the Tretyakov, Marina Loshak, who headed the Pushkin Museum for a decade — and whose daughter and nephew are journalists designated as “foreign agents” — announced she was “moving on.” Other museum chiefs, such as Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, publicly support the war.Theater director Yevgenia Berkovich and playwright Svetlana Petriychuk, who had criticized the war, were arrested in May 2023  for staging a play, “Finist, the Brave Falcon,” that prosecutors alleged “justifies terrorism.” They were convicted this month and each sentenced to six years in prison.Also in spring 2023, arrest warrants were issued for a Ukrainian Oscar-nominated film producer, Alexander Rodnyansky, who had lived and worked in Russia for decades, and a prominent theater director, Ivan Vyrypaev. By then, Rodnyansky and Vyrypaev were out of Russia.The Kremlin denied a request to interview Putin for this series. In a statement to The Post, the Culture Ministry confirmed that promoting patriotism is an official goal.“Today culture is the most important resource for the socio-economic development of the entire country,” the ministry said. “Traditional values of our society are transmitted through the images in cinema, theater, music and other areas of creativity for Russian and foreign audiences. And one of the tasks of the Ministry of Culture is to create conditions for more and more works of art to appear in various genres and forms, which will favorably influence the worldview and life attitudes of the younger generation.”The statement added: “The Ministry pays special attention to projects that emphasize spiritual, moral and patriotic values, as well as the cultural sovereignty of the peoples of Russia.”In the country that birthed Leo Tolstoy, Anna Akhmatova and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, literature is gradually being cleaved apart.Books by well-known authors such as Akunin — whose Erast Fandorin murder mysteries set in imperial Russia have sold nearly 40 million copies worldwide — have been banned, and others deemed too subversive have disappeared from stores.In February, a Moscow court charged Akunin with “justifying terrorism” and “spreading false information about the Russian army” and ordered his arrest, though he was already in London.Akunin described the charges as part of “a purge of the cultural sphere” and said that Russian artists and writers will now be split, as in Soviet times, between those who obey the Kremlin’s rules and those who “shut up or emigrate.”“There will be the inside zone of controlled culture where censorship and self-censorship will rule,” he said, “and the outside free zone which would exist on the internet, though the latter will be eventually firewalled.”For many writers, moral questions posed by the war have consumed their lives. Many have fled Russia. Some still in the country risk arrest by chronicling the trials of political prisoners or publishing diaries about the invasion, such as Natalya Klyuchareva’s “Diary of the End of the World.”Other writers remaining in Russia have conformed and adapted. A few, such as nationalist poet Igor Karaulov, are now the faces of Z literature — which celebrates Russia’s military prowess.Writers say Russia’s literary scene oddly has become more dynamic since the invasion, as the government infuses funds and seeks influence. “Paradoxically, there’s now more money, more projects, more events, more literary residencies than ever before, and so on,” said Dagestani author Alisa Ganieva, who writes in Russian.Ganieva, 39, left Russia in March 2022 and has been rootless ever since, never staying in one city for more than a few months. She broke with her publisher of 12 years because they remained silent about the war, and she said she has found herself “in a kind of freeze.”“I’m in limbo, between heaven and Earth, neither here nor there,” she said.Ganieva is working on a new, untitled novel but doesn’t know if it will be published. “Given that the censorship screws never stop turning,” she said, “there is certainly no publisher for it in Russia now.”Some of Russia’s most beloved singers — including legendary pop diva Alla Pugacheva, rock star Zemfira and singer-songwriter  Monetochka — have also fled abroad with their families.Many, not silenced, have found new, devoted audiences in Russian diaspora hubs such as Dubai and Bangkok.“My audience has dramatically expanded both geographically and in size,” said Ivan Alekseev, known as Noize MC, one of Russia’s most famous rappers. “We have internet, so the geographical aspect doesn’t play such a significant role.” Alekseev now plays sold-out shows in Europe and the United States, and his songs have become unofficial anthems for antiwar Russians.Filling the gap left by Noize MC and others, the platinum blonde, ultrapatriotic pop star Shaman has experienced a meteoric rise since the invasion and become a face of Russia’s wartime propaganda machine, reaching even North Korean singers who performed his hits during Putin’s recent visit there.For two hours, grotesque scenes unfolded on the movie screen.Ukrainian fighters worshiping portraits of Adolf Hitler while forcing a Jewish violinist to play the Luftwaffe’s anthem. Soldiers injecting heroin and dragging women away by their hair before raping them. A commander shooting a child five times in the back for speaking Russian.The movie, “The Witness,” was Russia’s first full-length feature about the invasion of Ukraine. Presented last fall as based on real events, the film follows an ill-fated Belgian musician as he bears witness to Ukraine’s purported war crimes.In Russia, unlike Hollywood, the state is the main patron of the arts. Most major film releases, including “The Witness,” are sponsored by the Culture Ministry and the Cinema Foundation. Official decrees outlining “priority topics” this year focused on films that promote traditional values. State funding is greater than ever — about $320 million last year.Rodnyansky, who produced the 2014 Oscar-nominated film “Leviathan,” called the increase in funding “a way to buy loyalty” from filmmakers. “In turn, they keep silent,” he said. “The government wants the creative class to understand that they should be scared.”In 2022, the Defense Ministry, at Putin’s request, set up a cinema foundation called Voenkino, headed by the defense minister, to “promote military-patriotic films and programs.”Voenkino officials consulted on “The Witness,” mobilizing active-duty soldiers as extras and providing props experts to ensure accuracy, according to the foundation’s website. The foundation also produced a TV series about the “heroes of the special military operation,” which it said averaged 2.5 million viewers per episode.At a screening of “The Witness” attended by a Post reporter, it was quickly evident that mandating movies suited to official sensibilities is easier than getting Russians to like them. Some spectators snickered at the script’s clunky lines. Four people walked out halfway through.The film flopped, earning about $156,000 — one-tenth of its production cost, according to box office statistics. In contrast, the commercial adaptation of a Soviet cartoon, “Cheburashka,” grossed $78 million.Still, “The Witness” resonated with some young people who packed a Moscow theater for the screening. “It was very moving,” said Anastasia, 33, a film producer who declined to give her last name because she was afraid of the potential repercussions.One spectator who walked out was a young independent film producer who punctuated her dismay over the film with an expletive.The young producer, who is not being identified because of the risks of criticizing the government, said opportunities for her and her circle of friends — budding filmmakers, producers and scriptwriters — have dwindled. Fledgling producers struggle to get entries accepted by international festivals. Financing is scarce. One remaining outlet, she said, is in fairy tales. “It’s the only way we can address the subjects that worry us,” she said.The producer said that she, too, was afraid to speak with a journalist and asked not to be identified. “Self-censorship is one of the most terrifying parts of all this — this is why I wanted to talk to you, to break through this barrier,” she said. “I’m deeply depressed and I’m raging. I’m feeling angry and powerless and desperate.”Artur Smolyaninov was completing his first record when the invasion started. After working successfully as an actor for two decades, he wanted to branch out to music.Feeling compelled to speak up against the war and support Ukrainians, Smolyaninov recorded a cover of “Obiymy” (meaning “Hug Me,” with opening lyrics that say, “Some day will come/ The war will end”) by Okean Elzy, one of Ukraine’s biggest rock bands. Katerina Gordeeva, a friend and popular interviewer, invited Smolyaninov onto her YouTube show to discuss his stance. The two-hour conversation amassed 9 million views and ended Smolyaninov’s career in Russia.One after the other, acting roles he was cast in vanished. At auditions, he was rejected repeatedly.“Then one director whose film was supposed to receive funding from the Ministry of Culture at some point simply called me,” Smolyaninov said. “He was just in the minister’s office, and the minister showed him a paper — my name was already on some black or gray list of people who have been banned.”A TV show he appeared in, already filmed and cut, was shelved after an official told the showrunner, who in turn informed Smolyaninov, that he could not appear on screens unless he renounced his antiwar stance. Radio stations refused to air his songs, he said, and concert venues declined to let him hold shows.“I didn’t want to leave,” he said. “But when mobilization was announced, it was a trigger that made me realize this is going to go on for a long time, get worse, and that the only path here is toward prison.”In addition to restricting financing to patriotic projects, the Russian government also develops blacklists that ban artists from performing live or appearing on TV, according to artists, talent agents and event promoters.The blacklists are not published or set in stone. Banned artists who cow to state pressure can be removed, as Philipp Kirkorov, the recently disgraced king of Russian pop, discovered.In February, Kirkorov gave an ad hoc concert in a drab hospital hall in Horlivka, an occupied city in eastern Ukraine, where video of the event showed he toned down his usual fashion choices — Swarovski crystals, feathers, sequins — in favor of an all-black outfit.For Kirkorov and another pop star, Dima Bilan, who went on an identical tour of the front in June, the visits appeared to be more about saving their careers than supporting the troops. They were among many celebrities caught in a scandal over a raunchy party in December that war hawks denounced as inappropriate debauchery.Putin publicly voiced outrage that Russian rapper Vacio had attended wearing only a sock over his genitals, and a vicious crackdown on party attendees followed.Vacio, whose real name is Nikolai Vasiliev, was jailed for two weeks and given a military summons upon release. He quickly fled abroad. Kirkorov and Bilan were among 50 artists on a blacklist sent to producers and promoters, Russian media reported. Nine had upcoming shows canceled.In its statement to The Post, the Culture Ministry did not respond to a question about blacklists. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied “any knowledge” of the lists. But a Russian music agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisal, confirmed to The Post that venues and promoters receive logs of artists who are out of favor and that local authorities then take action to revoke show permits.Kirkorov’s penance worked. Iced out for weeks after the raunchy party, in February he resumed public appearances in Russia, including on state TV, again dressed solemnly in all black.About this storyReporting by Francesca Ebel and Mary Ilyushina.

WaPo_40,Harris has super-charged Democratic hopes of taking the House,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/harris-has-super-charged-democratic-hopes-taking-house/,2024-07-29 18:06:02.753605,,"Good morning, Early Birds. It’s been a little over a month since President Biden and Donald Trump debated in Atlanta, which kicked off a historic and exhausting month in politics. We feel like we’ve been through our own Olympics already. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … Vance’s Catholic conversion is part of a young conservative movement … How Kamala Harris’s early career prepared her for this moment … but first …Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) was nowhere to be found earlier this month as President Biden quietly joked about his age and defiantly declared he would not let anyone “push me out of this race” at a low-key rally in Baldwin’s hometown of Madison, just days after an uncharacteristically bad debate sent Democrats spiraling and forced lawmakers running in competitive races to distance themselves from the president.But just a few days ago, the two-term senator, who faces a tough reelection battle of her own, was beaming as she spoke before Vice President Harris in front of a roaring crowd of re-energized Democrats in West Allis.The scene underscores the feeling of cautious optimism that’s boosting Democratic candidates all the way down the ballot in the eight days since Biden stepped aside. Now that Harris has an opportunity to introduce herself to a Democratic base re-energized by her candidacy, congressional Democrats are starting to see a path to victory with less than 100 days until Election Day, even as Republicans are organizing themselves around a new line of attacks they hope will tie Democrats to Harris’s past positions, Marianna reports with our colleague Liz Goodwin.While House and Senate Democratic candidates were running ahead of Biden down ballot over the past month, Democrats feared that a depressed base would result in historically low voter turnout, which is critical in swing districts where elections are determined at the margins. But over the past eight days, the once-depressed Democratic base has awakened, helping amass more money and a volunteer army down-ballot.Democratic lawmakers remain shocked by the outpouring of enthusiasm that has re-energized their base. It helped to quickly mend tensions last week between pro-Biden lawmakers and Democrats who called on Biden to step aside after those harboring feelings over how the past month was handled coalesced behind Harris.Democratic strategists running Senate and House campaigns noted an abrupt shift in messaging as soon as Biden, 81, passed the baton to Harris, 59, from an operation focused on the president’s record the last four years to a campaign leaning into the future with slogans like “We’re not going back.”House Democrats also see the future-forward messaging as a welcome change, cheering on Harris as she embraced “freedom” as a core tenet, and noted her sharper messaging compared to Biden on abortion rights and other issues.Harris’s strengths have presidential strategists hoping that Sun Belt states including Nevada, Arizona and Georgia may be back in play after the Biden campaign had begun to write them off. That is welcome news for Democrats running for the Senate there: Rep. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.) and Sen. Jacky Rosen (Nev.). Democrats also believe Harris’s candidacy will help incumbents in the “Blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, states Democrats historically have won to secure the White House.In the red states of Ohio and Montana, where Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester are fighting for their political lives, it’s less clear that Democrats will be aided by Harris at the top of the ticket.Democrats say Harris must use this opportunity to reintroduce herself to a public that does not know much about her as Republicans are sharpening their attacks.Many swing-district Democrats — which represent districts with an almost evenly split mix of Democratic, Republican and independent voters — are telling Harris’s campaign that she needs to run to the center rather than appeal to the far-left.Democrats are battling deep dissatisfaction among voters with inflation and the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the border. It’s why Republican strategists are not shying away from telling candidates to tie their opponent to Harris, who is intrinsically tied to Biden.Republican campaign strategists said they plan on telling voters about Harris’s liberal record as a “San Francisco radical” — as National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines (R-Mont.) put it — to emphasize that she would only make America worse off than Biden has, who has been considered a more centrist Democrat throughout his career.While Republicans sharpen their attack lines, the latest influx of cash by Democrats is something keeping them up at night. Democratic campaigns outraising Republicans negatively affected House Republicans’ attempts to win more competitive seats during the 2022 midterms and a similar effect could happen this year.There are 99 days until Election Day. Harris will travel to Georgia on Tuesday — her sixth visit to the state this year. We’ll be watching her veepstakes.Trump will travel to Harrisburg, Pa. on Wednesday.The Senate will vote on final passage of the Kids Online Safety Act and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act 2.0, two bills to set guidelines for children online.The House is out until September.The president will travel to Austin where he will visit the LBJ Presidential Library and deliver remarks and commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, legislation that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law.The trip was postponed from two weeks ago after the attempted assassination of Trump.There have been many comparisons between Biden and Johnson’s 1968 reelection campaign, where he also dropped out. We’re watching to see if Biden addresses the comparisons.JD Vance, the senator from Ohio who is now the GOP’s vice-presidential nominee, was baptized Catholic in 2019 after being raised nominally evangelical and then dabbling with atheism.“In his conversion, he is part of a cohort of rising young conservative figures who are bucking the general trend of young Americans to reject institutional religion — and many, experts say, are choosing Catholicism,” The Washington Post’s Michelle Boorstein writes. “Catholicism, religion analysts say, exudes the confidence and staying power of a two-millennia-old hierarchical institution — not to mention the world’s biggest church — at a time when so much seems unstable.”The same thirst is driving rising Catholic interest in the Latin Mass, where conservative views on theology are common, and is also reflected in the priesthood, which has gone from the majority being very or somewhat liberal theologically and politically until the 1970s to majority conservative today.Vance has said he looked for a philosophy that incorporated doubt, embraced scientific advancements like the theory of evolution and also came from somewhere “more ancient.”“But Vance’s Catholicism, like that of many church members including President Biden, lines up with Catholic teaching only in limited — but very different — ways,” Michelle writes. “Vance supports the death penalty in some cases, wants to boost fossil fuels, wants to deport millions of migrants and has voted against many government programs aimed at aiding the poor. All of those positions are in opposition to his church.”Until the very end, some people close to Donald Trump tried to talk the former president out of picking Vance as his running mate, our colleagues Meryl Kornfield, Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker report.“Trump listened as each person made their case, but they said the former president said his gut had been with Vance for many weeks, if not months — liking his Rust Belt upbringing, foreign and economic policy positions, pugnacious TV appearances, and academic pedigree,” our colleagues write. “Vance had influential backers, including Donald Trump Jr. and tech billionaires.”The Post’s Reis Thebault takes a look at Harris’s early career as a prosecutor and her approach as San Francisco district attorney, and how that role shaped who she is now.While she was running for DA, Harris branded her approach “smart on crime” in an attempt to balance law enforcement and liberal values, Reis writes. She opposed capital punishment and called herself a “progressive,” yet the San Francisco Chronicle’s endorsement still declared she was “for Law and Order.”“As Harris assumes the role of Democrats’ likely presidential nominee, those who worked with her and campaigned against her in California say her time in the crucible of her hometown’s politics could be both blessing and burden come November,” Reis writes.Must-reads from The Post:A ‘weird roller coaster ride’: Trump vs. Harris and America’s surreal summer.

But it’s really dominant at women’s basketball.Since the Olympics added a women’s basketball tournament in 1976, the U.S. team has won nine gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal. The only time the American women didn’t medal: 1980, when the United States boycotted the Games in Moscow.Led by WNBA MVPs A’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart, the U.S. will enter the Paris Olympics as the overwhelming favorites to win its eighth straight gold medal dating from the 1996 Games. The American women hold a 72-3 overall record at the Olympics and have won 55 straight games dating from the 1992 bronze medal game. If the U.S. prevails in Paris, guard Diana Taurasi will claim her sixth gold medal, which would be an Olympic record for any men’s or women’s basketball player."
WaPo_42,Christian Pulisic is happy and confident. But Copa América was ‘difficult to take.’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/29/christian-pulisic-copa-america-usmnt-coach-ac-milan/,2024-07-29 18:02:02.753605,,"BASKING RIDGE, N.J. — As a 25-year-old whose overspilling résumé already includes appearances in a World Cup, three FA Cup finals and a UEFA Champions League title game, Christian Pulisic long ago stamped out any nerves on soccer’s grandest stages. But the bright lights of a late-night television studio? That’s an altogether unfamiliar field.When Pulisic popped up on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” on Thursday, he acknowledged feeling pangs of unease as the curtain pulled back. But like a second-half substitute thrown into the fray, the AC Milan attacker promptly settled in. Soon enough, he was hitting talking points about his Pennsylvania roots, youthful indiscretions and would-be goal celebrations over six minutes of bits and banter.“I think if I had to do that when I was 17, 18, at the beginning of my career, I would have struggled a lot more,” Pulisic said during an interview the next day, before Milan’s 3-2 friendly win over Manchester City on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. “My agents always gave me a hard time. I struggled to kind of open up, and I kept to myself, and I didn’t want to really talk to people ever in interviews or anything. So I think I’ve improved in that way.”That said, Pulisic still calls himself a “pretty simple guy off the field,” one who would rather spend his spare time relaxing, catching up with friends and decompressing on the golf course. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, an English midfielder for Milan who also played with Pulisic at Chelsea, confirmed that the Hershey, Pa., native isn’t one to crave the spotlight.“He doesn’t want all the attention off the pitch,” Loftus-Cheek said. “He’s a quiet, calm guy. It’s nice to be around a person who is kind and who you’d want in a good friend.”But exposure comes with the territory for the most influential and recognizable star on the U.S. men’s national team for the better part of a decade, especially when Pulisic is repping his Italian powerhouse club on its preseason tour of the United States. That means manning the media front lines and gamely addressing uncomfortable topics, such as the U.S. squad’s group stage exit from Copa América this summer — a reverberating result that cost coach Gregg Berhalter his job.Reflecting on the Americans’ abbreviated run, Pulisic emphasized the fine margins by which his team’s tournament turned. He referenced the disallowed strike, rash red card and late goal conceded in a pivotal 2-1 loss to Panama, then the relentless but fruitless pressure in a 1-0 defeat to Uruguay. And he stressed the importance of wielding such a setback as a learning experience.“We just couldn’t hold on barely in that second game and then had all the pressure in that last game,” said Pulisic, who captained the squad at Copa. “We wanted to play better. Those were definitely not the results we wanted, but I think there’s things that we can do to improve as a team. Everything happens for a reason.“It was difficult to take, definitely, how it ended in Copa, but I think it just makes me especially and the team hopefully just more hungry to go on and do bigger and better things coming up soon.”Pulisic demurred when asked about the qualities he would like to see out of the next coach, whom the U.S. Soccer Federation hopes to have in place before a pair of September friendlies. When it came to Berhalter, the coach who led the U.S. team for the better part of six years, he was more forthcoming.Pulisic said he will “always be thankful” for the time spent with Berhalter, who coached the Americans to the World Cup round of 16, two Concacaf Nations League titles and a Gold Cup crown. He stressed that “we did improve as a team” during a tenure that began with Berhalter sifting through the rubble of the Americans’ failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. But Pulisic also acknowledged feeling optimistic about the program’s potential under a fresh perspective.“We had a good relationship with Gregg, but now moving on, I think it’s the right —” Pulisic said, before pausing and reframing his thought. “Yeah, the federation is going to make the right decision and know where to go moving forward.”While Pulisic won’t decide whom U.S. Soccer appoints, whether it’s a buzzy foreign hire such as Spain’s Luis de la Fuente or an upstart American candidate such as Los Angeles FC’s Steve Cherundolo, he can ensure he’s at the top of his game to impress whoever does take the reins.On that front, Pulisic’s outlook with the Rossoneri seems rosy. For arguably the first time in his career, he’s entering his club season not scrapping for his spot in the lineup but ready to retain it. In league play last season, he hit career highs with 36 appearances, 32 starts, 12 goals and eight assists as Milan finished second in Serie A. A propulsive dribbler and crafty finisher, he added another three goals over 12 matches in the Champions League and Europa League.“It is not easy for a foreigner to arrive in the first year and perform like Christian,” said Paulo Fonseca, the new Milan coach who joined from French club Lille. “It’s difficult for a player like him to find space in Italy. So if he did so well in the first year, I believe he can do better in the second year.”Zlatan Ibrahimović, the ex-Milan great who last year rejoined the club as an adviser, added: “With Christian, I think he’s happy. You see when a player is happy outside the field because if you’re happy outside, you’ll be happy also [on the field].”After spending a 3½-week offseason taking his mind off soccer while visiting family in Pennsylvania and Florida, Pulisic linked up with Milan and took part in his first training session under Fonseca on Friday. Following his 10-minute cameo against Manchester City, he will look to ramp up his involvement and impress the new staff in exhibitions against Real Madrid on Wednesday in Chicago and Barcelona on Aug. 6 in Baltimore.“I’m really happy with last season, but that doesn’t give me any reason to be complacent or comfortable with where I am,” Pulisic said. “We have a new coaching staff as well, and from the first training today, I wanted to go in and give a good first impression and show what I’m all about. Of course, I feel a lot of confidence and a lot of ease from my performances last season, but I have to take it to another level and show that I deserve to be on that field always.”When Pulisic returns to Milan ahead of the club’s Aug. 17 season opener, he will do so immersed in an Italian culture he said meshes with his easygoing lifestyle — though he knows this time around to be conscious of the Ferragosto holiday that partially shuts down the country for much of August. “Last season I was, like, trying to get WiFi for my house and trying to get this, that, whatever, and no one wanted to help me,” he said through defeated laughter. “That was just funny to me.”As for the national team, Pulisic is ready to get to work under the new coach, who will have less than two years to prepare the U.S. team for a World Cup it’s hosting alongside Mexico and Canada. Although the Copa América exit still stings, Pulisic knows this generation of players’ legacy will be defined by how the Americans fare at home in the summer of 2026.“It’s an awesome opportunity for us,” Pulisic said. “It’s an opportunity for us to really change the sport in this country forever. That’s been a goal of ours. I think we’ve come a long way in recent years, for sure, with the national team, but there’s a whole ’nother step that we can take — and we need to take.”"
WaPo_43,DC Open becomes an Olympics alternative for many top tennis players,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/29/dc-open-tennis-olympics/,2024-07-29 18:02:02.753605,,"Emma Raducanu sat on a stage at what she called one of her favorite tournaments but acknowledged she was a bit conflicted about being there.Like many prominent players in this year’s DC Open field, Raducanu declined an opportunity to compete at the Paris Olympics, opting instead to spend her summer on the North American hard-court circuit. It was a difficult choice. “Of course there are elements of FOMO — missing out,” the 21-year-old Brit said at a pretournament news conference Saturday, a day after she watched the Games’ Opening Ceremonies. “… A part of you obviously wants to be there representing your country.”With main-draw play set to begin Monday at William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park, players cited different reasons for ultimately choosing D.C. over Paris. Some wanted an opportunity to prepare for the hard courts and humidity of the U.S. Open, in a sport in which major titles are more prestigious than gold medals. Others were in pursuit of ranking points that tour events offer but the Olympics do not.Above all, many wanted to protect their health by maintaining the routines of a traditional tennis schedule. Players with significant injury histories were especially reluctant to shoehorn a transition back to the clay courts of Paris in between the grass- and hard-court seasons.“The change of surface isn’t the best thing for me right now,” said Raducanu, who has battled injuries since winning the U.S. Open in 2021. “… When I think big picture, long term, it’s the right call.”The 55th edition of the DC Open, the sticky, sweaty staple of D.C.’s midsummer calendar, will host top-20 players, former Grand Slam champions and recognizable Americans despite competing directly against the Olympic tennis tournament. The main draw runs from Monday until Sunday.In addition to Raducanu, the women’s singles field includes world No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka, No. 16 Ons Jabeur, No. 20 Victoria Azarenka, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens. The men’s draw features No. 9 Andrey Rublev along with three top-30 Americans: No. 14 Ben Shelton, No. 23 Sebastian Korda and No. 29 Frances Tiafoe.“We’ll make it our small Olympics here,” Jabeur said. “... This tournament is pretty strong. So many top athletes are here. … It’s going to be a very tough draw.”Jabeur, a trailblazing icon in her native Tunisia, decided to forgo the Olympics because of a balky knee that makes surface changes especially arduous. Instead, the fan favorite and three-time Grand Slam finalist is appearing in D.C. for the first time since 2019.“There are so many players that had different injuries, and they chose not to risk [going to the Olympics] because of that,” the 29-year-old Jabeur said. “You’re playing clay, playing a big event like the Olympics, I think you need to be ready and perform at your best. I’m not very young anymore.”Likewise, former world No. 2 Paula Badosa was wary of aggravating a back injury that caused her to miss three of the four majors last year.“If I keep changing from hard to clay and grass, at the end I can struggle,” said Badosa, who is making her debut appearance at the DC Open. “[My back] can get inflamed more easily. … Sometimes mentally you’re a little bit scared of that. I want to avoid that feeling. When I have one surface for weeks, I think my body adapts better. … I think that’s the smartest decision.”Korda, whose father, Petr, won the tournament in 1992, said he wanted to play a tournament closer to home after spending several months in Europe. He said he hopes to compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Games and follow in the footsteps of his sisters, Nelly and Jessica, both Olympic golfers.Tiafoe, meanwhile, is a native of Hyattsville and a crowd favorite who is making his eighth appearance at his home tournament.The field also includes players whose nations have been banned from the Olympics over their involvement in the war in Ukraine and who could compete in Paris only as neutral athletes. Among the tournament’s seeded singles players in that situation are Rublev, Karen Khachanov, Daria Kasatkina, Liudmila Samsonova and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova from Russia, along with Sabalenka and Azarenka from Belarus.The Olympics did poach several stars from last year’s draw — most notably defending women’s singles champion Coco Gauff, who was one of the U.S. flag bearers during the Opening Ceremonies.But enthusiasm for the D.C. Open remains high. Stadium tickets are sold out for the fourth year in a row, though some grounds passes for the outer courts remain available, according to tournament chair Mark Ein.On Saturday, for the first day of qualifying, thousands of fans dressed in linen shirts, sundresses and visors walked the concourses as the sounds of squeaking sneakers filled the air. Many peered through chain-link fences to catch glimpses of players on the practice courts. Outside a player compound, kids surrounded Azarenka, Korda and Khachanov, seeking autographs on their oversized souvenir tennis balls.“I’m really humbled by the support we’ve gotten in this community,” Ein said. “I’ve always known, being a product of it myself, that we have one of the best tennis communities in America. … I think [the turnout] is a huge tribute to how much people watch and love the sport and love this event.”"
WaPo_44,How Elon Musk came to endorse Donald Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/29/musk-trump-endorsement-immigration/,2024-07-29 18:00:02.753605,,"Elon Musk began privately gathering support for Donald Trump’s second presidency long before he tweeted his public endorsement on July 13.At least five months earlier, Musk made a pitch for Trump at the Palm Beach oceanfront mansion of Wendy’s co-founder Nelson Peltz, where some of the billionaires and top political strategists gathered to discuss 2024 campaign strategy were surprised to see him.The Feb. 16 event included a number of Trump skeptics: Karl Rove, a former adviser to George W. Bush and a current adviser to hotelier Steve Wynn, argued that the assembled crew should give money to down-ballot candidates and state parties. Another donor urged the crowd to keep helping GOP contender Nikki Haley, according to attendees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.But Musk, sitting by Peltz at the center of the table, offered an explicitly pro-Trump view, the attendees said. He started by saying he was not a big fan of Trump, but then segued into a lengthy discussion of illegal immigration. While President Biden would allow millions of additional undocumented immigrants to cross America’s southern border — to the detriment of the U.S. economy and American land, Musk asserted — Trump would stop the crossings, he said. He added that a surge of immigrants would fuel a demographic shift that could doom the Republican Party in future elections.Musk asked people in the room to tell their friends to vote for Trump, saying he’d learned from his experience selling Teslas that word-of-mouth promotion was critical. Some people in the crowd shook their heads and winced.Despite his support, Musk was concerned — along with other potential donors — that Trump might use their money to pay his rising legal bills, the attendees said. Others, he acknowledged, might not want to appear on campaign disclosure forms.So he suggested giving to an outside group instead. In May, Musk helped launch America PAC, which in a little over a month reported raising $8.5 million, much of it from Silicon Valley. Musk has signaled that he will donate, too, but he denied a report in the Wall Street Journal that he would give the group $45 million a month.Musk’s presence at the Palm Beach event marked the culmination of a political transformation for the world’s richest person, who has said he favored  Biden in 2020. But in the four years since, Musk’s relationship with the Biden administration steadily soured.Under Biden, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have advanced  investigations into Tesla’s marketing of its driver-assistance technologies. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a recall of almost every Tesla  over concerns about driver inattention. The SEC is pursuing a separate investigation into X, formerly Twitter, which Musk purchased in 2022. And Biden has personally ridiculed Musk’s business acumen, once quipping that the best way for NPR to disappear would be for him to buy it, while the White House snubbed Tesla at a high-profile electric vehicle summit in 2021.A second Trump administration promises a very different environment for Musk, analysts and investors said. Trump could ease Tesla’s regulatory path to delivering a fully autonomous personal vehicle — a goal key to the company’s $700 billion valuation — they said, and dial back federal scrutiny of Tesla and X, as well as a National Labor Relations Board investigation into allegations of harassment at SpaceX.Meanwhile,  SpaceX and Starlink, Musk’s satellite business, stand to gain fresh federal contracts. Clare Hopper, chief of Space Systems Command’s Commercial Satellite Communications Office, said her office already is seeking an additional $12 billion over the next decade for “low-Earth orbit satellites” in anticipation of soaring military demand. That spending could increase further under a proposal outlined in Project 2025, an agenda for Trump’s second term drafted by prominent Republicans, to give Space Force attack capabilities.“In the Biden administration, Musk has been an afterthought at best,” said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “In the Trump administration, if he won a second term, Musk would be front and center.”Trump, for his part, has expressed enthusiasm about his growing alliance with the billionaire. At a recent campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., Trump said of Musk: “We have to make life good for our smart people and he’s as smart as you get.”The Trump campaign declined to answer questions about Trump’s intentions regarding Musk. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.One person who has known Musk for years said he sees Trump as a change agent even as he sometimes disagrees with his approaches and policies. Musk also likes Trump’s pick for vice president, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, a former venture capitalist who moved in the same Silicon Valley circles as Musk, who lobbied for Vance to join the ticket. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations.In conversations with donors and Trump advisers after the February event, Musk repeatedly raised the border and his fears that the 2024 election will not be secure. “The border and election integrity seem to be the two things he cares about,” said one person who has spoken to him.Neither Trump nor any of his advisers were present at the event, which was convened by the billionaires.Musk’s money is expected to build a campaign apparatus in a number of swing states amid widespread Republican concerns that Trump’s team does not have a sufficient program to get out the vote, people familiar with the plans said.It’s a stark shift from 2016, when Musk told CNBC days before the election that he felt Trump was “not the right guy” because he “doesn’t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.”After winning the White House, Trump tried to woo Musk and other CEOs, meeting with them at Trump Tower in New York City in December 2016 and again shortly after his inauguration. Trump praised Musk throughout his presidency as a “friend,” “somebody I have great respect for,” and “one of our great brains.”In 2020, Trump showed up to celebrate as SpaceX became the first private company to launch humans into space. And he supported Musk’s decision to defiantly reopen Tesla’s Fremont, Calif., plant after county officials ordered it shut down during the covid-19 lockdowns.But Musk found Trump’s first term disappointing, according to two people familiar with his thinking. In 2017, Musk stepped down from two of Trump’s presidential advisory councils to protest Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. “Climate change is real,” he tweeted. “Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.”During the 2020 election, Musk favored Biden.A few months later, the White House invited every major American automaker except Tesla to a splashy event on the South Lawn. The electric vehicle summit included Ford, Stellantis and General Motors, along with the United Auto Workers. Tesla, the only nonunion American auto giant, petitioned to be included, but the Biden administration left the company out — a decision Musk later described as “the White House giving Tesla the cold shoulder.”A former Biden administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations, said the White House kept the gathering small because covid-prevention measures were still in place. But the official said it’s also true that Biden, with the UAW in attendance, wanted to burnish his pro-labor reputation.Musk took it as “the Biden administration was mean to me,” said the official, who attended the event. “Is this just because you guys don’t like Elon?” the official recalls a Tesla executive asking.The snub was a miscalculation that later overtures to Tesla failed to overcome, the official said. In a Christmas Eve post on X, Musk listed the event and Biden’s comments crediting GM’s leadership with the EV revolution as among his complaints with the Biden administration.Since the event, Biden has occasionally criticized Musk directly. He said Musk’s relationships abroad were “worthy of being looked at” after a reporter asked if Musk’s ownership of Twitter was a threat to national security.And when Musk expressed pessimism about the economy, Biden shot back: “Lots of luck on his trip to the moon” — an apparent non sequitur. “Thanks, Mr. President!” Musk responded on X, reposting the press release that SpaceX was under contract with NASA to build a spacecraft to bring American astronauts back to the moon.Last November, the Biden White House condemned Musk for what it called the “abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate” in his social media feed, contributing to an exodus of advertisers from X. Musk apologized.If Musk was disappointed by Trump’s White House, he soon grew frustrated by Biden’s, according to a person who has known Musk for years. Musk has been infuriated by Democrats on social issues, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations, but was especially frustrated by the Biden administration’s approach to innovation and regulation.During the covid-19 lockdowns, Musk frequently lashed out against prevention measures and expert opinions. He also found himself weighing in increasingly on social issues, embracing politics in a way he hadn’t during much of the Trump administration.One executive who worked with Musk, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss his former boss, said Musk’s forays into the culture wars appeared to be driven by ideological conviction: “The battle wasn’t motivated by trying to make money.” Musk reinstated Trump’s Twitter account in 2022 — soon after he purchased the company — reversing a decision by previous management that Trump had glorified violence after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.This month, Musk announced that SpaceX would relocate its headquarters to Texas from California to protest a new California law that bars school districts from requiring that parents be notified if their child changes their gender identification.Musk has a transgender daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, who disavowed her father in 2022. In an interview last week with conservative psychologist Jordan Peterson, Musk said Wilson had been “killed” by what he called the “woke mind virus.” (Wilson soon took to Threads to decry Musk’s descriptions of her childhood as “entirely fake.”)During the interview, Musk also praised Trump, saying he had shown “instinctual courage” when he jumped up after being grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.“Now you have to admire that Trump, after getting shot, with blood streaming down his face … nonetheless was fist-bumping,” Musk said, and telling the crowd to “fight, fight.”Musk tweeted his endorsement of Trump less than an hour after the shooting, touching off a wave of other Silicon Valley endorsements.Brian Hughes, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said Musk’s endorsement is a sign of something bigger. “Many of the nation’s most important leaders in technology and innovation are concerned with the damage done to their industry by the Biden-Harris Administration’s failure to handle our economy and moves to overburden innovators with government bureaucracy and unrelenting regulation,” Hughes said in an email.Last week, Vice President Harris’s campaign signaled that it would not bend over backward to try to win Musk back. “Arrogant billionaires only out for themselves are not what America wants or what America needs,” Harris campaign spokesman James Singer told  The Washington Post when asked about Musk’s endorsement of Trump, echoing earlier comments.So far, Musk has been dismissive of Harris. On Friday, he praised a video on X that was manipulated to make Harris appear to say she was a “deep-state puppet” who didn’t know anything about running the country. “This is amazing,” Musk commented.While analysts and investors predicted a second Trump administration would be good for Musk, there are no guarantees with the former president.In a move to court traditional manufacturers, Trump vowed at the Republican National Convention to “end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,” which he said would save the U.S. auto industry “from complete obliteration” and save consumers thousands of dollars.Trump also has promised a fresh trade war with China, which would bring supply chain uncertainty for almost all major manufacturers, Tesla included.And Trump has not always praised Musk: In a post on Truth Social in 2022, Trump bragged that Musk had sought his help on “subsidized projects,” including “driverless cars that crash, or rocket ships to nowhere,” adding that he could have required Musk to “drop to your knees and beg” and Musk would have done it.Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said Musk’s alliance with Trump is also likely to alienate many Tesla buyers. On Tesla’s earnings call last week, Musk seemed to acknowledge the risks of Trump 2.0, saying the potential loss of the Inflation Reduction Act “would hurt Tesla slightly.”But Musk’s support for Trump is a “trade-off,” Munster said, that involves accepting short-term negatives for a bonanza of potential positives in the long term.“Near-term, it’s going to be some form of a headwind. Trump can be polarizing,” Munster said. But “I think that Musk knows this. And ultimately he doesn’t care.”Trisha Thadani, Cat Zakrzewski and Christian Davenport contributed to this report"
WaPo_45,JD Vance’s Catholic conversion is part of young conservative movement,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/29/jd-vance-religion-catholic-republican-vp/,2024-07-29 18:00:02.753605,,"JD Vance’s beloved grandmother — Mamaw, as he called her — hated organized religion, didn’t go to church and hung a drawing of Jesus in her house that presented him as a kind everyman. So when Vance became drawn to Catholicism, with its hierarchy, intellectual rigor and art showing an imperial Jesus, he said, he worried what his late grandmother would think.“I couldn’t shake the feeling that if I converted I would no longer be my grandmother’s grandson,” Vance wrote in a 2020 essay for the Catholic magazine the Lamp, about the woman he credits with raising him.But Vance, the senator from Ohio who is now the GOP’s vice-presidential nominee, overcame whatever reservations he had, drawn by what he has described in interviews as Catholicism’s rich, detailed and nuanced philosophy and also its long history. Raised nominally evangelical, then dabbling with atheism, Vance was baptized Catholic in 2019, in his mid-30s.In his conversion, he is part of a cohort of rising young conservative figures who are bucking the general trend of young Americans to reject institutional religion — and many, experts say, are choosing Catholicism. Catholicism, religion analysts say, exudes the confidence and staying power of a two-millennia-old hierarchical institution — not to mention the world’s biggest church — at a time when so much seems unstable.The same thirst is driving rising Catholic interest in the pre-Vatican II-style Mass, where the priest speaks in Latin, many women wear veils and conservative views on theology are common. It’s also reflected in the priesthood, which has undergone a dramatic ideological change in recent decades — from the majority being very or somewhat liberal theologically and politically until the 1970s to majority conservative today, according to a study released last fall from Catholic University.Vance has said he looked for a philosophy that incorporated doubt, embraced scientific advancements like the theory of evolution and also came from somewhere “more ancient,” he wrote in 2020 in the Lamp.“I really like that the Catholic Church was just really old,” Vance said at a 2021 conference of the Napa Institute, a conservative Catholic think tank. “I felt like the modern world was constantly in flux. The things that you believed 10 years ago were no longer even acceptable to believe 10 years later.”But Vance’s Catholicism, like that of many church members including President Biden, lines up with Catholic teaching only in limited — but very different — ways. Vance supports the death penalty in some cases, wants to boost fossil fuels, wants to deport millions of migrants and has voted against many government programs aimed at aiding the poor. All of those positions are in opposition to his church. A spokesman for Vance declined to comment for this story.Religion experts say some of the same instincts Vance followed are also driving the growth of interest among younger people in general in gods and goddesses of paganism as well as saints, angels and demons and commemorations of the new moon.“The appeal of religious tradition, whether through the [Latin Mass] or popular piety and devotions, is becoming more attractive in a society that appears to be losing a sense of deeper cultural roots in the face of identity politics, overconsumption and the individualistic pursuit of material success,” David M. Lantigua, co-director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at Notre Dame, wrote The Washington Post in an email. “As religious belief and church attendance declines among younger Americans, Vance reflects an interesting turn to institutional religion that preceded, and perhaps even inspired, his entrance into the political process.”Other prominent conservative political, media and academic figures who have converted to Catholicism include Harvard legal scholar Adrian Vermeule, TV host Laura Ingraham, journalist Sohrab Ahmari and same-sex marriage opponent  Brian Brown.Data on the number of  conversions is spotty. Polling organizations including Pew Research have long showed that many more people are leaving the Catholic faith than joining it — by more than 6 to 1. The most recent General Social Survey, in 2022, estimated that 1.4 percent of all adult Americans are converts to Catholicism, which would amount to about 3.7 million people. According to the Center for Applied Research on the Apostolate, a Catholic research center at Georgetown University, most are former Protestants or people who used to be religiously unaffiliated.How this crop of conservative Catholic converts will apply their new faith to policy isn’t fully clear, as experts say it’s not a very unified group, and its members have differing aims. However, they are different from most recent generations of the evangelically influenced religious right, experts say, and from older, prominent Catholic converts from the Reagan and Bush eras, such as commentator Robert Novak, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), who emphasized traditionally conservative economic policies.Vance, like others in this era, talks more warmly about some populist economic ideas and is more skeptical about free trade and big business.Vance has said he saw Catholicism as reflecting messages from across the political spectrum: from the right, an emphasis on personal responsibility, and from the left, an emphasis on the harm caused by systemic barriers. Social conservatism in the future needs to be about more than “issues like abortion. It has to have a broader vision of political economy, and the common good,” he said in 2019.In the Senate since 2023, he has not proposed any bills that have become law, and he has voted against every major spending bill that has come forward. Largely, he has approached help for those in need by favoring boosting economic growth over government welfare programs — contrary to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ position that the government can levy taxes to meet its responsibility to “assist and empower” the poor and unemployed. He has at times supported initiatives that break with Republicans, however, including legislation that would have given low-income people subsidized internet access.Some Catholics are pushing back on Vance.“Many of those seeking the so-called American Dream today, to the point of risking everything, are undocumented Hispanic migrants that Trump has villainized and stereotyped in unjust and deceptive ways,” Lantigua said. “If Vance is serious about putting virtue and duty back into a politics concerned about the common good and low-income workers, especially those who pick the produce he eats, then he will have to reckon with Trumpist policies that are overly isolationist, downright nativist, and rhetorically racist.”The church teaches that “the dignity and rights” of a person aren’t dependent upon that person’s political and citizenry status, Lantigua said.The very different policy priorities of Vance and Biden, both churchgoing Catholics, show “there is no one Catholic faith,” said Geoff Layman, head of the University of Notre Dame’s political science department and an expert on political behavior and religion. Vance, he said, is very committed to church teachings on abortion and gender, while Catholic officials like Biden adhere on economic justice and immigration.Vance has addressed several recent Catholic conferences focused on new right ideas like post-liberalism. During a panel at a 2023 book event at Catholic University in Washington, Vance identified himself as a member of the “postliberal right,” Politico reported.Broadly, the post-liberal movement seeks a greater government role to form a society run on socially conservative Christian values.He also spoke at a 2022 “Restoring the Nation” conference at Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, where he and other speakers advocated against a secular and neutral public square.Some in the movement are focused on the idea that humans need a social authority — like the pope — and want the government to join parents and schools in encouraging some ways of life and discouraging others, said Mark Lilla, an intellectual historian from Columbia University. Others also believe in objective moral truths but are less focused on using state power to lead people to those truths, he said.Lilla says he sees a lot of Catholic converts and a huge Catholic subculture at elite universities, including his own.“It’s kind of a reboot of what [President George W.] Bush called ‘compassionate conservatism,” Lilla said of one view of Catholic post-liberalism. Another view, he said, is that it’s essentially made up of Christian nationalists who want “an American Constitution 2.0.” It doesn’t necessarily make the Vatican an authority, he said, but “reinterprets American law and the Constitution in such a way that there are a set of values and principles that should be taken as foundational to the regime.”Vance’s description of his journey from unaffiliated evangelical to Catholic convert says a lot about modern American religion, Layman said.White people like Vance’s grandmother who are strongly anti-institution and don’t go to church but consider themselves very much Christian were a huge part of the Trump base from the start and explain how religious conservatives could connect with him, Layman said. This phenomenon was so common that Layman and a co-author of a 2020 book about new religious-political fault lines used the term “mamaw” to describe nominally Christian Trump supporters, an allusion to Vance’s grandmother, by then well known because of his popular memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy.”Vance, fluent in both evangelical and Catholic cultures, is now navigating a party whose rank and file is dominated by the former, even as he represents the rising power of the latter in the conservative movement. He has sought to unify the groups around a common social conservatism, as opposed to any differences.In a talk this month to the evangelical advocacy group Faith & Freedom Coalition, which lists “marriage and family” as its top priority, Vance mentioned his “Christian” faith several times but never used the word “Catholic.” When he told his story of returning to faith, he spoke not of the intellectual pull of his new faith or the comfort of its longevity, but of his desire to be a more gentle father and husband.He urged the group not to be discouraged by Trump recently omitting references to same-sex marriage and a federal abortion ban in the GOP platform, moves that irked some Republicans.One of Trump’s great virtues, he said, is “he is uniquely aware of politics being the art of the possible. How do we advance the ball one yard before we advance it 10 yards, before we advance it to a touchdown?”Liz Goodwin contributed to this report."
WaPo_46,Europe 101: How to avoid being a clueless American abroad,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/europe-travel-etiquette-tipping-americans/,2024-07-29 19:59:02.981227,,"It’s been a summer of record-breaking travel numbers in Europe. Boosted by crowd-drawing events like Taylor Swift’s Eras tour and the Paris Olympics, crowds are fueling social media posts of tourists showing off Aperol spritzes on Italian beaches or cheesing on the Champs de Mars.If you’re among the many looking forward to a European vacation, you don’t want to be that American. Research the culture of where you’re going ahead of time, and learn how its customs (national or regional) differ from those in the United States. According to European travel mogul Rick Steves, the goal of this research shouldn’t be to avoid culture shock, but to curate it,“You can learn from the school of hard knocks, you can fumble around over there and have a great time,” Steves said. “But if you understand the context of what you’re going to be seeing and where you’re going to be living, you can get more out of it and have more fun with it.”This curation can help you appreciate cultural differences for what they are, and be prepared for all the other things you can notice.“There are things that you’re not even going to know or think are different until you experience, and that’s the beauty of it,” said Kacie Rose, an American travel influencer living in Italy.Want a quick primer?

While more of Europe now is turning to air conditioning, travelers who want AC should check with their hotel or Airbnb hosts directly to confirm it’s available.

Even when AC is available, it may not be as potent as your unit back home, according to Ethan Jones, a travel adviser at Vincent Vacations. Air conditioners in Europe are often add-ons rather than centralized units, so they’re less efficient.
“Europeans are used to it being warmer, so they get the bare minimum AC to knock it down just 5 or 10 degrees,” Jones said.Air conditioning is especially rare in northern European places like Britain or Denmark, and even in parts of France that historically have had colder winters and more temperate summers.

You should also always clarify whether you want sparkling or still, just in case.If you want tap water, you can ask, but it’s no guarantee the restaurant or bar will oblige. Asking for a “cup of water” in certain countries, like Spain, where restaurants and bars are required by law to provide free tap water when requested, will often get you tap water.Regardless of the kind of water you get, though, it’s unlikely there will be ice.Across Europe, and especially in southern European countries like Spain and Italy, there are plenty of beautiful public fountains where you can fill up a reusable bottle free.
Rome alone has approximately 2,500 water fountains spouting a constant flow of clean water. These water fountains often serve a double function: they’re decorative touches to the city’s ancient streets and can be a lifesaver in extreme heat. You can find a fountain just by walking around — or with tools like the Waidy app.
If you’re not sure whether a fountain has drinkable water, you can look up the specific rules for the place you’re in. In many countries, you can rest assured that a public fountain’s water is safe to drink unless you see a sign telling you otherwise.Across Europe, and especially in southern European countries like Spain and Italy, there are plenty of beautiful public fountains where you can fill up a reusable bottle free.Rome alone has approximately 2,500 water fountains spouting a constant flow of clean water.

“A three-star [in the United States] is a pretty clean, well-priced hotel. Over there, it’s going to be an older, lesser-staffed hotel,” Villa said.
If you’re looking to save money, there can be good options in the three-star range, but booking one might just require more research.While looking for a hotel for your trip, know that American standards for a certain class of hotel will not always line up with European one.“A three-star [in the United States] is a pretty clean, well-priced hotel.

You can expect smaller rooms and bathrooms, too.
“The newer hotels that they’re building, they’ve kind of caught on to what the American standard is,” Villa said. “But if you stay at an older, boutique hotel, you’re probably going to find a room that’s smaller.”
Bathrooms at boutique or budget hotels could resemble “RV-style” bathrooms because of their small size, Jones said. Because many buildings in Europe are older, space for bathrooms wasn’t always allotted, so they had to be added after the fact.
Travel expert Samantha Brown added that, sometimes, hotels will only provide one small towel. She thinks there’s a case to be made for bringing a small sports towel on your travels, just in case.
Because everything is generally smaller — and older (read: no elevators) — she also recommended travelers contact the hotel ahead of time if they have accessibility concerns.While U.S. hotels are more likely to offer larger rooms with king-size beds, Villa said the maximum size in Europe will often be a full or queen-size.

But there’s a catch: Unless they’re owned by a private business (and sometimes even then), those restrooms require patrons to pay a small price — not usually more than a euro — via a machine or to an attendant to use them.
Don’t expect every bathroom to look like an American one, either. Countries in Southern and Eastern Europe, for example, sometimes have squat toilets that sit in the ground. Many countries also forgo dividers between urinals.Public restrooms in Europe can be found frequently in parks, gardens, train stations and even on the street.

In Europe, though customs vary from country to country, you aren’t expected to tip as often. And when you do choose to leave a tip, the standard is 10 percent, rather than 20.
Brown, who hosts several TV shows for the Travel Channel, said that while it can feel rude not to tip, it’s not as necessary an income source for service workers in Europe as it is in the U.S.: “They’re paid a living wage, they have health insurance,” she said. “They have all the bells and whistles that we don’t.”
“It also depends on what kind of facility you’re at,” Villa said, explaining that it still might be customary at a five-star hotel to tip a porter for carrying bags to your room.
Some restaurants now include an option to tip after paying on a credit card, but it’s not typically expected. According to Jones, you should use that option to show appreciation for exceptional service.U.S. tipping culture has permeated everything from dining at fancy, well-serviced restaurants to buying a coffee from a screen.

To plug in your phone and other devices in Europe, you’ll need an adapter.
When picking out an adapter, it can be helpful to prioritize getting a smaller, more robust one to make sure you’re well equipped if you run out of juice while out on the town. A Type C plug adapter will serve you in all of Europe except the United Kingdom and Ireland, where you will need a Type G.Europe has differently shaped and more powerful electrical outlets than the United States does, running at 240 volts rather than 120.

Restaurants for dinner may not open until 6 p.m. or later, and won’t likely be buzzing with life until around 8 or 9 (unless the line is mostly tourists). For lunch, the standard mealtime is around 2 or 3 p.m.
“If they eat dinner late in Spain, eat dinner late in Spain, or know that you can go to a bar and have tapas anytime you like and call that dinner,” Steves said. “But if you insist at going to a restaurant at 7 o’clock in Madrid, you’re going to be eating with the staff.”
When you do go out to eat, portions will often be smaller than in the United States, and taking home leftovers may be frowned upon, depending on the country and setting.
In much of Europe, restaurants also charge a cover (“couvert” in France, “coperto” in Italy). This can either be a fixed rate per diner — kind of like a price for seating — or a fixed price for consuming the bread, olives and other small dishes that greet you at the table. The former must be paid, as it is a sort of service charge. If it’s the latter, you can avoid the charge by not eating the dishes or asking the waiter to take them back.
Be warned, though, that trying to get out of paying the cover can be seen as a faux pas.In many European countries but especially in the south, people eat much later than in the United States.

Even learning a handful of words, like “hello,” “goodbye” and “thank you,” makes a big difference. “It goes a million miles. You would be surprised how much people appreciate it,” Brown said. “They don’t expect you to conjugate verbs, but you can be polite in another language.”
In some places, like France, it can even be seen as rude to walk into shops or restaurants without saying a quick “bonjour” or “bonsoir” at the door.
You should never walk into an interaction assuming someone speaks English, and asking if they do could be seen “as a challenge or put down,” Brown said.
“That changes the dynamic immediately,” Brown added. “And when you’re in these places, you really are relying on the kindness of strangers.”While it’s not necessary (or possible) to attain fluency in a different language before every trip, it’s “always respectful to learn the basics,” Rose said.Even learning a handful of words, like “hello,” “goodbye” and “thank you,” makes a big difference. “It goes a million miles.

Knowing from the jump that things will be different helps you avoid stereotypical tourist behavior.
“A lot of culture shock can happen because you’re not used to things being done in the same way,” Rose said. “That’s when entitlement comes through.”
Rather than being frustrated by smaller hotel rooms or the lack of iced coffee, she advised approaching everything with a “when in Rome” outlook.

Each country has its own norms.
“Looking at Europe as a whole does it a disservice,” Jones said. “You can look at various regions — like the south, north, the Scandinavian countries and others — and each region has it’s own personality. Each country within the region will also have its own distinct personality, culture, food.”
In Spain, for instance, understand that “siesta” culture means many workers break around 3 or 4 p.m., and many businesses close for a few hours.
To make the best of any European vacation, Jones recommended travelers do some research so that they know what to expect.

WaPo_47,"To a list of American journalists jailed in Russia, add Alsu Kurmasheva",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/07/29/alsu-kurmasheva-journalist-russia-detained/,2024-07-29 19:59:02.981227,,"One basketball player went for one arms dealer.One former Marine went for one cocaine smuggler.What might the journalists go for?Such is one of the questions — there are so many questions — for another family alighting in Washington, caught up not so much in a new Cold War between Russia and the United States, but something closer to a perverse and messy version of a trading-card show, only with real humans on offer for swaps.There have been others, too many others, but this time, it was the husband and daughters of Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor and broadcaster for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the editorially independent, U.S.-funded media organization that reports the news in 27 languages across 23 countries from its headquarters in Prague. They shuttled from television studios to congressional offices to advocacy events, trying to draw attention to the waking nightmare of this 47-year-old veteran journalist and American citizen imprisoned in Russia on trumped-up charges of spreading false information about the Russian military.The settings could be as surreal as the dilemma. There was Kurmasheva’s 16-year-old daughter, Bibi Butorin, ushered through the heavy barriers swaddling the U.S. Capitol grounds, past the oceans of police and guns, into an eerie, echoing Capitol mostly cleared out for another Bibi — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — in advance of his address to Congress. There was her sister, Miriam, about to turn 13, sitting next to her in a windowless, wood-paneled meeting room with that elegant, old-school red carpeting, listening to the government officials and advocates walk a small group of reporters through the latest numbers on Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad.Grim words, jargon, acronyms. Torture. Moral hazard. SPEHA (that would be Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, but SPEE-haw to anyone in the know).Later, over lunch nearby, Bibi tried to explain the unexplainable. Her mother wasn’t even on a reporting trip when she was detained last year in the Russian republic of Tatarstan, where the Volga and Kazanka rivers meet more than 500 miles east of Moscow. Her mother was visiting Bibi and Miriam’s elderly grandmother.“It’s crazy that it’s happening to her,” Bibi said. “It’s not like she was on the front lines.”Kurmasheva was temporarily detained by Russian authorities on June 2, 2023, while waiting for her return flight at the airport in Tatarstan’s capital, Kazan, where she’d gone to see her mother. A dual citizen of Russia and the United States, she was flagged for allegedly not registering her U.S. passport. Both of her passports were confiscated, essentially trapping her in the country.Her husband, Pavel Butorin — the director of RFERL’s Current Time TV — thought it was a minor paperwork issue that could be easily resolved. Weeks passed before he told his daughters.And yet it was far from easy.All through the summer and into the fall they waited. In October, Bibi, at home in Prague, got a text message from a friend. Something like: “I just saw. I’m so sorry.” She had no idea what her friend was talking about.“I was like, ‘okay, thank you,’” Bibi remembers responding. Then she went to Starbucks to meet another friend, who passed along some news she’d just read: “Did you see an RFE journalist was detained? I think in Russia.”Bibi knew it had to be her mother. And yet, it was almost impossible to process at the time.“I didn’t understand what a big deal it was until I saw it on the New York Times,” she said.Kurmasheva, who had been under house arrest, was now in prison. The Russian court system is inscrutable to say the least, and Pavel Butorin said that to this day, he’s not precisely sure what charges she faced when she was imprisoned awaiting trial Oct. 18, 2023.Her husband worried that she’d soon been forgotten. In the corridors of U.S. power, her name wasn’t being mentioned.“What’s up with that?” he thought. “You can’t pronounce her simple name? It’s four letters. It pissed me off.”That began to change this past April when President Biden mentioned her by name in his remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner while also referencing the better-known case of Evan Gershkovich, a 32-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia in March 2023 while on assignment for the newspaper.“Journalism is clearly not a crime,” Biden told the audience of media executives, reporters, government officials and celebrities. “Putin should release Evan and Alsu immediately.”For many, it was the first time they’d heard her name.Her husband said he still relies on news reports, which have suggested that his wife may have been targeted because she was one of the editors of the book, “Saying No to War: 40 Stories of Russians Who Oppose the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.” He said he’s also certain that Russian authorities would have been familiar with Kurmasheva — an ethnic Tartar who was born in Kazakhstan but grew up in Tatarstan — because she’d been a RFE/RL newscaster before moving into a less-public editor’s role. (Kurmasheva became a U.S. citizen through a program for employees of U.S.-sponsored media abroad. Her daughters are also U.S. citizens. Her husband, who grew up in Russia, is a U.S. citizen, too, but renounced his Russian citizenship long ago.)Since Kurmasheva’s detention, Pavel Butorin and his daughters have had only limited communication with her. They send postcards, but her responses — made more infrequent and complicated by a miasma of Russian prisoner rules — have been heavily censored.The family was in Washington for two July weeks of media appearances and meetings with U.S. government officials when they got the news that Kurmasheva had been sentenced to 6½ years in a penal colony for supposedly spreading false information about the Russian military. The sentence had been handed down three days earlier, on July 19, the same day that a Russian court sentenced Gershkovich to 16 years in prison on espionage charges following his arrest last March.In an interview, Diane Foley — founder of the Foley Foundation, which hosted the Capitol event attended by Kurmasheva’s daughters and husband — said that journalists are particularly prized by despotic regimes to silence the flow of information.“Putin doesn’t want people to know the truth,” she said.The arrests and sentencing of the two journalists have been met with widespread condemnation of the Russian regime of Vladimir Putin by media organizations and the U.S. government. It has also thrust their families into the labyrinth of international diplomacy.For some, finding a way out of that labyrinth amounts to a quest for an affirmation from the U.S. government that has attained an aura of mystery, something like a holy grail for the families of American’s imprisoned abroad. It’s an official designation that a person has been wrongfully detained, which pushes that person’s case to a part of the State Department — the one represented by that SPEHA acronym that Kurmasheva’s daughters and husband heard about during the Capitol event they attended July 24.SPEHA has juice. It has broad authority to negotiate prisoner swaps and has access to special resources and diplomatic tools.Basketball star Brittney Griner — who was freed in a 2022 prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as “The Merchant of Death” — had received the designation after she was arrested outside Moscow for carrying a small of amount of cannabis oil. So too had Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine who had been accused of assaulting a Russian police officer after a night of heavy drinking and was later swapped for a Russian drug smuggler.Advocates have been critical of the wrongfully detained designation process because it’s so opaque, leaving families puzzled about who gets it and why. Foley — whose freelance reporter son, James, was beheaded in 2014 by extremists after being held captive in Syria — calls the designation something “precious” but incredibly difficult to attain.Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, was quickly designated wrongfully detained. But Kurmasheva has not been — for reasons unknown.In a different version of her story, she would have been home long ago. Her husband was so confident her passport problem would be quickly resolved that he bought tickets for his family of four to see a Taylor Swift concert next week in Warsaw — on Miriam’s 13th birthday. Now they’ll just be three."
WaPo_48,A critical shortage of cardiologists affects care nationwide,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/critical-shortage-cardiologists-affects-care-nationwide/,2024-07-29 19:41:02.981227,,"Good morning, I’m Mark Johnson, a science reporter at The Washington Post and someone who appreciates as short a trip as possible when it comes time to see the doctor. I never realized what a luxury my 15-minute drive was until I interviewed 72-year-old Lenore Tate, who lives in Sacramento and endures three hours in the car to visit her cardiologist at Stanford University, for a story on a national cardiologist shortage.Today’s edition: Reproductive-care groups are bracing for a wave of patients from Iowa as the state’s new abortion ban takes effect. Federal regulators are warning patients about dosing risks associated with compounded versions of popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. But first …The United States needs more cardiologistsAmerica has a supply-and-demand problem when it comes to heart disease. The illness is the country’s No. 1 killer, but almost half of all counties lack a single cardiologist.That’s what a research team from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston found when they examined all 3,143 U.S. counties; over 46 percent had no cardiologist. Worse, the counties most likely to be without a cardiologist happen to be those most likely to need one. These are largely rural areas with high levels of smoking, diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure — the telltale signs of heart disease.The cardiologist problem forms part of the larger, decades-old rural health-care crisis. Robert A. Harrington, dean of Weill Cornell Medicine, describes the disparity between health care in rural and urban areas this way: “Your Zip code tells more about your health outcomes than your genetic code,” he said. “And that’s certainly the case with rural America.”Since January 2005, 192 rural hospitals nationwide have closed or converted to facilities that do not provide inpatient care. And in the 20-year period ending in 2019, the gap in the death rates in urban and rural areas almost tripled.In cardiology, the effects are acute, burdening both patients and doctors. Tate, who has congestive heart failure, said that even in Sacramento there are not enough cardiologists to meet the need. It can take months to get in to see a local doctor.“It’s more than a hardship,” she said of the three-hour drive to see her doctor at Stanford. “There are times I’ve had other illnesses and injuries that have made it difficult for me to get in my car and drive.”Stephen Sigal is one of two full-time cardiologists in Titus County, Tex., who serve a four-county area of about 3,000 square miles. It’s an area plagued by high levels of heart disease.“It’s rare that I work less than 12 hours a day,” Sigal said. “It’s not uncommon that I work 16 to 18 hours in a day.”Usman Salahuddin, a cardiologist for Ochsner Rush Health in Meridian, Miss., said surrounding Lauderdale County has 11 other cardiologists. But there are none in the adjacent counties.“We don’t have cardiothoracic surgery or electrophysiology, specialty fields within cardiology,” Salahuddin said. “So we do the first triage assessment and then we, in turn, have to refer them out,” as far as Hattiesburg an hour and a half away, or even New Orleans, about three hours away.Attracting cardiologists to rural areas hasn’t been easy. Salahuddin, who went to medical school in his native Pakistan, said he received a special visa to train in the United States that required he spend three years working as a doctor in an underserved area. More such programs may help address the shortage of cardiologists.The use of telemedicine to connect patients with their distant doctors may also help. But experts suggest health officials will probably need to find other innovative programs.

There are exceptions for cases of rape, incest, a fetal abnormality “incompatible with life” or if the life of the mother is in danger.Iowa had previously permitted abortions until 22 weeks of pregnancy. More than 4,000 procedures were performed in the state last year, a number that is expected to drop by at least 97 percent under the new ban, according to Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States.Reproductive-care groups in neighboring states where the procedure remains legal are already seeing an influx of patients from Iowa. The Chicago Abortion Fund received more than 60 support requests from Iowa residents during the first three weeks of July, a 165 percent increase over previous months.Meanwhile, across the country:FDA warns of dosing errors from compounded weight-loss drugsThe Food and Drug Administration is warning patients and doctors about dosing errors associated with compounded versions of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs.In an alert Friday, the federal regulator said it had received reports of adverse events, some requiring medical attention or hospitalization, that may be related to overdose. The agency cited instances of patients who were unfamiliar with how to measure doses with a syringe, and health-care providers calculating incorrect doses by mixing up metric conversions, resulting in patients taking five to 10 times more than intended.Why it matters: Generic versions of Ozempic and Wegovy have skyrocketed in popularity due to ongoing shortages of the brand-name drugs. While the FDA exercises some oversight of compounding pharmacies, their drugs don’t undergo the agency’s premarket review for safety, effectiveness or quality.📅 Welcome back!

WaPo_49,World leaders cast doubt on Maduro’s claim of victory in Venezuelan election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/venezuela-presidential-election-result-maduro/,2024-07-29 19:28:02.981227,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Several countries, including the United States and some Latin American nations, cast doubt on the results of Venezuela’s presidential election on Monday and called for transparency over how votes were counted after President Nicolás Maduro’s electoral council declared him the winner.“We have serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in Tokyo on Monday, calling on electoral officials to publish the “detailed tabulation” of votes. “The international community is watching this very closely and will respond accordingly,” he added.Some Latin American countries — including Colombia, which has friendly ties to Maduro — also expressed skepticism of the results, along with a number of European nations, including Spain and Italy. Russia, China, Iran and Cuba were among those to congratulate Maduro.Venezuela’s pro-government electoral council said early Monday after partial results that Maduro won 51 percent of the vote to opposition candidate Edmundo González’s 44 percent, despite independent polling suggesting that González won twice as many votes as Maduro. Maduro, an authoritarian socialist, has been in power since 2013, and many blame him for the oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, including hundreds of thousands to the United States.González also claimed victory late Sunday night, saying: “The results are undeniable. The country elected a peaceful change.”“What has happened in our country is a huge social movement that they will not stop,” María Corina Machado, the driving force behind the Venezuelan opposition campaign, said during a news conference early Monday. “We are a civic peaceful movement, and that’s how we will keep working until we make the truth prevail, and it will prevail.”In the run-up to the election, Maduro’s government barred Machado — Venezuela’s most popular politician — from running, arrested campaign workers and blocked access to state media. On Sunday, there were reports of blocked access, delays and violence at some voting centers.Maduro’s claim to victory in Sunday’s election threatens to further isolate him on the world stage. In 2018, Maduro claimed victory amid charges of irregularities, prompting global condemnation and mass protests in the country.In a statement early Monday, Maduro claimed without evidence that the electoral council had been hacked from an unnamed country, causing a delay in the publication of the full results of Sunday’s election. “The demons and the devils did not want the total to be counted,” Maduro said.Latin American leaders across the political spectrum cast doubt on the results.Colombia’s foreign minister, Luis Gilberto Murillo, called for an independent verification and audit of the vote count “as soon as possible.”Left-of-center Chilean President Gabriel Boric described the official results as “difficult to believe,” demanding that independent international observers be given access to the full results. “From Chile, we will not recognize any result that is not verifiable,” he wrote on X early Monday.On the other end of the political spectrum, Argentine President Javier Milei also said he would not recognize a “fraud,” posting on X that “Venezuelans chose to end the communist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro.” The far-right South American leader called on Venezuela’s armed forces to “defend democracy and the popular will.”Peruvian Foreign Minister Javier González-Olaechea said he called Peru’s ambassador to Venezuela for consultations, accusing Maduro’s regime of having the “intention of fraud.” “Peru will not accept the violation of the popular will of the Venezuelan people,” he said on X.Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay also issued calls for a transparent count of the votes by independent observers.Meanwhile, Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia and Honduras — all allies of Venezuela — dispatched messages congratulating Maduro on the announced election result.After the Russian ambassador to Caracas described the electoral council’s vote tally as “credible,” President Vladimir Putin congratulated Maduro. “Remember that you are always a welcome guest on Russian soil,” Putin said, in a message to Maduro.China’s Foreign Ministry congratulated Maduro and Venezuela for a “successful” election. “China and Venezuela are good friends and partners who support each other,” Chinese state media reported ministry spokesperson Lin Jian saying at a news conference.Cuba’s Foreign Ministry said Raúl Castro, the country’s former communist leader and younger brother of the late Fidel Castro, called Maduro to congratulate him.At one voting center in the Chacao neighborhood of Caracas on Sunday, voters waited in line for more than six hours to cast their ballots, breaking into chants of “We want to vote!” A Washington Post reporter saw a gang of hooded Maduro supporters punching and kicking people outside a polling center in Caracas who had complained about being denied access to a vote count.Edison Research, a N.J.-based firm, interviewed more than 6,800 voters at 100 locations in exit polling after voting centers began to close Sunday. It found that González outpolled Maduro among men and women, rural, suburban and urban voters, and every age group.Sands reported from London. Christian Shepherd in Taipei, Taiwan, and Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, contributed to this report."
WaPo_50,Eight times it might be healthier not to forgive,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/29/not-forgive-danger-pain-apologies/,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"There’s a “forgiveness industry” of books, coaches, TED Talks and services promoting radical exoneration from every angle. Yet after a decade researching the concept of forgiving for a book on the topic, I found that pardoning people too quickly can often be harmful and self-destructive. That’s especially true when it comes to trauma.“People who don’t forgive are sometimes portrayed as cold, hardhearted or inflexible. But that’s pathologizing the person harmed versus the offender who caused the damage,” said Ramani Durvasula, a psychologist in Los Angeles and the author of the book “It’s Not You: Identifying and Healing From Narcissistic People.” But “sometimes it’s more authentic and empowering to move on without forgiving.”To be sure, holding a grudge over small slights can be self-defeating and unhealthy, but there are cases where turning the other cheek might be the wrong move. The following is a list of situations in which it’s better not to forgive and forget:1. If prejudice is involved: Emillio Mesa, a San Francisco events planner, told me he was horrified by a homophobic story his mother relayed. He moved away, waiting years to come out to her, only reconnecting after she accepted him fully. Both of them made healthy decisions, one expert said.“You never have to put yourself in a place where you’re unfairly persecuted for who you are,” said psychiatrist Carlos Saavedra. “In fact, self-protection and keeping the right boundaries are essential to your well-being.”2. When you aren’t ready: After Kate Walter was dumped by her girlfriend of 26 years, Walter didn’t feel that her ex deserved forgiveness — she said the woman had reneged on long-term promises and refused to apologize. While Walter might decide to forgive her someday, the Manhattan teacher soothed her soul through yoga, meditation, New Age retreats, joining a different church and publishing a memoir about her hurt.3. When “sorry” is insufficient: Despite treaties and formal statements, most victims of mass persecution can’t forgive their oppressors. Emanuel Mandel, a Holocaust survivor living in Maryland, noted to me that the Nazis who had slaughtered his relatives weren’t the ones who apologized for killing 6 million Jews. The reparations Germany offered, however, greatly helped Mandel’s family and he learned “to thrive out of spite.”4. If there’s no regret or repairs: At 12, Kenan Trebincevic was exiled in 1993 during the Balkan War. He remained enraged that it ended in stalemate. By publicly rallying against the injustices he witnessed against Bosnian Muslims, Trebincevic, a physical therapist at Columbia University hospital, found peace as a spokesman for his people.Something good came out of his anger. While promoting the book we co-wrote recounting his traumatic war experiences, he met the Sarajevo-born Mirela, now his wife and mother of his son, who has dual citizenship. By facing down his past, he found his future.5. When conditions aren’t met: After the drunk driver who killed Gary Weinstein’s wife and two sons was jailed, Weinstein asked the court to take away the man’s driver’s license forever. The Michigan jeweler waited until a judge agreed before he publicly forgave the driver.In her book “A Good Apology,” Boston psychologist Molly Howes says effective apologizing must acknowledge the offense, explain what happened, express remorse and offer reparations, and you can ask for — or demand — specific compensations or hold off until they’re satisfied.6. If personal safety is compromised: When Sharisse Tracey was 16, her father raped her. Their Baptist counselor, she said, coerced her to forgive him to keep their family together. Her father then tried to do it again. Tracey stopped him, but he was not punished. He has since died. In her 40s, Tracey posthumously un-forgave him, which she found liberating.“The pressure to forgive can lead some people to feel guilty or prematurely forgive,” Durvasula said. “We should not feel an obligation to forgive someone who has hijacked our souls and made it impossible to find peace.”Durvasula herself keeps several people in her life at a distance. “I don’t forgive them because what they did changed my view of myself,” she said. “I spent years crawling out from under that rubble. I still struggle with self-doubt. My trust is diminished. They took away my safety in the world. How do you forgive that?”7. When forgiving could endanger others:  Former D.C. Police Sgt.  Aquilino Gonell was almost killed in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Because of the injuries he sustained, Gonell had to leave his job, but he continues to testify against Jan. 6 defendants. Instead of forgiving, Gonell says he fears further attacks if those charged in the attack are released too soon. (Gonell and I were co-authors of his memoir, “American Shield: The Immigrant Sergeant Who Defended Democracy.”)8. Before you have all the information: “Something you don’t know might shed light on what happened,” said Vastal Thakkar, a psychiatrist in Connecticut. He shared an example: “A commuter was enraged when a woman in an SUV stopped abruptly to get something in the back seat, almost causing an accident. He didn’t know the driver’s infant was choking.”Following her parents’ divorce, the only contact that a Texas student named Jackie Roberts had with her alcoholic mother was family calls. Her father would answer the phone and put her mother on speaker. If she was drunk, her father hung up. At first, Roberts believed her mom had deserted their family, with no remorse. But then her mom sent a Facebook message, asking if they could speak.“I never got a chance to say I'm sorry,” she told her daughter. “My drinking got out of hand. I wish things could have been different. I love you. You can always call me.”“I haven’t seen her in 10 years. But we talk on the phone now,” Roberts said. “When I call, if she slurs her words, I say 'I can’t talk to you when you’re drinking. I’ll call you tomorrow, Mom.’ And I do. It was a big deal for her to take responsibility and try to step up. It was healing my heart. Her apology opened a window. I totally forgave her. It’s kind of crazy how much an apology can do.”Susan Shapiro is the author of the memoir “The Forgiveness Tour,” which comes out in paperback this week."
WaPo_51,"For NBC’s Jimmy Roberts, the Olympics never get old, even at his 20th Games",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/jimmy-roberts-nbc-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"The night before he worked his first Olympics, as a production assistant at the 1980 Lake Placid Games, Jimmy Roberts was asked to stand in for legendary broadcaster and longtime Olympic host Jim McKay. It was a tech rehearsal and Roberts, tapped to play the part of one of his idols in the comfort of a heated studio, had a cushy job compared with some of his fresh-faced peers.“There was a kid standing at the ice oval with a sign hanging around his neck that said ‘Keith Jackson,’ ” Roberts recalled in a phone interview last month.Forty-four years later, Roberts is as recognizable to Olympic TV viewers as McKay was then. The Paris Games, where Roberts will work as a reporter for NBC, will mark the University of Maryland graduate’s 20th Olympics. His excitement hasn’t waned in the decades leading up to the milestone assignment.“The Olympics never disappoint,” he said. “They’re just so full of stories, which is what I think sports is all about.”Roberts might not be the one telling those stories if he had been a slightly better lacrosse player. The captain of the lacrosse team at White Plains High in New York, Roberts arrived at Maryland as a freshman in 1975 hoping to earn a spot on Coach Bud Beardmore’s team, which had just won its second national title in three years. He was cut before the season began.Roberts, who did some sports broadcasting in high school, called lacrosse games for Maryland’s student-radio station, WMUC, instead. After ABC announced in March 1976 that its “Wide World of Sports” would broadcast the lacrosse national championship game two months later, Roberts dialed the network’s main number to volunteer his services. He wouldn’t take no for an answer.Maryland made it to the final, where the Terrapins met fellow undefeated Cornell in Providence, R.I. The Big Red prevailed, 16-13, in overtime in what’s considered one of the greatest games in college lacrosse history. Frank Gifford did play-by-play for ABC, while Roberts sat in the production truck, helping the TV crew understand the intricacies of a sport the NCAA began sponsoring just five years earlier. He would do similar work for ABC throughout his undergraduate years.Working as a waiter at newly opened RJ Bentley’s in College Park after graduation in 1979 and unsure of his next steps, Roberts called a production assistant he knew at ABC and offered to work the U.S. Women’s Open in Fairfield, Conn., later that summer. The production assistant — none other than Sean McManus, McKay’s son and the recently retired chairman of CBS Sports — gave him the job.Roberts worked the golf tournament and several other events for ABC that fall, including freshman quarterback Dan Marino’s first start at the University of Pittsburgh. When ABC needed someone to help with a variety of tasks at corporate headquarters in New York to prepare for its coverage of the 1980 Winter Games, it hired Roberts. From there, he said, it was “off to the races.”Roberts was assigned to the speedskating venue in Lake Placid, where he was responsible for working with the chyron operator to display information and graphics. Roberts still considers American speedskater Eric Heiden’s record five individual gold medals that year the greatest athletic achievement of all time.After Lake Placid, Roberts was promoted from production assistant to associate director. He won his first Emmy Award in 1984 as an associate producer for “SportsBeat,” a 30-minute investigative program hosted by Howard Cosell, and then worked for ABC News.“It was just such a dream come true for me, the fact that I was making a living in sports television,” Roberts said.In 1988, fearing that his job might be eliminated amid organizational changes at ABC, Roberts considered a future telling stories in front of the camera. He asked a cameraman to shoot a stand-up of him reading features he had written and produced for Cosell, McKay and Jackson, and he sent his audition tape all over the country.The only outlet willing to overlook Roberts’s lack of on-camera experience was ESPN, where John Walsh, a former Washington Post editor, was running “SportsCenter.” The first event Roberts worked for ESPN was the Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks heavyweight boxing championship fight in June 1988. Despite what he recalled as a steep learning curve, Roberts would become the face of the cable network’s golf and boxing coverage over the next decade.In 1999, NBC signed a deal with General Motors to create features at the Olympics called “GM Moments.” Longtime NBC sportscaster Dick Enberg had been slated for the role, but after the network lost its NFL broadcast rights, Enberg decided to leave for CBS. NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol saw Roberts as the perfect replacement.At the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, his first Olympics with NBC, Roberts wrote and narrated a memorable piece about swimmer Eric “the Eel” Moussambani. The 22-year-old from Equatorial Guinea qualified for the Games as an International Olympic Committee wild card and had learned to swim just a few months earlier. After the two other swimmers in Moussambani’s 100-meter freestyle heat were disqualified for false starts, he found himself swimming solo. Moussambani, who had never been in an Olympic-size pool, struggled to finish, but the crowd got behind him. Roberts’s account of the emotional scene won an Emmy.Two years later, at the Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Ebersol tapped Roberts to interview Mike Eruzione and Jim Craig after the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey duo lit the Olympic cauldron with their teammates. The Opening Ceremonies came five months after 9/11, and Roberts said the “feeling of unity was palpable.”NBC invited McKay, who hadn’t worked an Olympics since 1988, back for his 12th Games in Salt Lake City, where the 80-year-old offered nightly commentary alongside studio host Bob Costas. In a segment at the start of the Games, Roberts had the honor of introducing McKay, whom he grew up idolizing.“I remember saying, ‘Now I get to say something that I never imagined I would ever be able to say on television: I’m joined by Jim McKay,’” Roberts said. “Cut to a shot of Jim, and he says, ‘You were always my favorite production assistant.’”Of his 19 previous Olympics, the most memorable event Roberts covered was Dan Jansen’s gold medal-winning race in the 1,000-meter speedskating final at the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, a triumph that came after so much heartbreak.Last year, Roberts had the privilege of telling one of the most meaningful stories of his career, a deeply personal essay about the U.S. Army regiment that liberated the small northeastern France town of Farebersviller from Nazi occupation in late 1944. Roberts’s father, who died in 2007, was a 21-year-old private first class in the regiment’s Company C.“NBC put the full weight of its resources behind it,” Roberts said of the Emmy-nominated feature, which he wrote after visiting Farebersviller for the first time. “I’m enormously proud of that piece. It’s the best thing I’ve done and the most important thing I’ve ever done. It was totally surreal to me.”Today, one of Roberts’s Emmys sits on a shelf behind the bar at RJ Bentley’s, where framed jerseys of former Maryland greats adorn the walls. Roberts still makes it back to College Park to speak to journalism students, and he remains a devoted follower of the Terps’ lacrosse program. In Paris for his 20th Games, he was eager to experience the Opening Ceremonies, which took place on the Seine, and curious to see how U.S. gymnast Simone Biles performs at her third Olympics. He’s most looking forward to the unexpected.“Something always happens to make you come away from it thinking this is the greatest thing you’ve ever seen,” he said."
WaPo_52,Does anxiety make your heart race? Try these simple tricks to find calm.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/29/anxiety-high-heart-rate/,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"I can feel my heart beating quickly when I’m feeling anxious or stressed. What can I do about it? Is this normal?You can slow a rapid heart rate, caused by anxiety and even cardiac arrhythmias, using a classic technique called vagal maneuvers. These are simple actions that engage the vagus nerve — the major nerve connecting the brain to your internal organs.There are two main options I recommend:The vagus nerve is responsible for easing us into “rest and relaxation” mode — as opposed to sympathetic nerves that drive a “flight-or-fight” response. In the case of a Valsalva maneuver, increasing pressure in the chest cavity causes your blood pressure to rise. This elevation is detected by sensors in your major blood vessels, triggering a reflex to try to decrease that pressure. The way your body does that is to increase vagal nerve activity, which, in turn, slows down your heart rate.Vagal maneuvers have up to a 54 percent success rate in returning the heart rate to normal, but they are typically not considered long-term solutions.Getting the right evaluation and treatment for a racing heart is critical. There are many causes of an abnormally racing heart that can be explored with your physician, such as arrhythmia or dehydration. Atrial fibrillation, as another example, affects more than 2 million Americans. POTS, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which we’re seeing more and more of since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, tends to affect younger women who may have joint hypermobility or autoimmune disease. Also, a hyperactive thyroid, anemia such as from iron loss, and caffeine can all elevate your heart rate.It’s normal for your heart to race when you’re frightened or stressed — it could be that you’re about to give a speech at your brother’s wedding, or you’ve been called out by your boss during a meeting after you spaced out.But sometimes people’s hearts start to race for no apparent reason. This is never normal. In fact, I’ve seen numerous cases where people get told this is an anxiety problem and no further cardiac studies are ordered.A study of over 100 patients with an arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm, called supraventricular tachycardia found that more than half of all patients had initially met with a physician who did not recognize their symptoms as  being from the condition. Women were, unfortunately and not surprisingly, twice as likely as men to be told the problem was “psychiatric.”Panic attacks are common: At least 11 percent of American adults experience one each year. These attacks can look very similar to supraventricular tachycardia: lightheadedness, sweating, nausea and heart racing. And the hallmark symptom of supraventricular tachycardia is a sense of “impending doom” — much like what occurs with a panic attack.To make matters worse, living with an unpredictable heart rhythm may well aggravate any underlying anxiety. In fact, while 67 percent of people with supraventricular tachycardia would technically meet criteria for a panic disorder, that percent plummets to 4 percent after they undergo appropriate treatment for their cardiac issue.At rest, your heart rate should be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (it may be even lower if you’re an athlete). People who have an abnormally fast heart rhythm, such as supraventricular tachycardia, tend to have heart rates in the range of 150 to 250 beats per minute.Knowing how to find a pulse is an important skill because it allows you to measure a heart rate in a pinch.The easiest places to find a pulse are either the brachial artery (in your wrist) or the carotid artery (in your neck). Personally, I tend to find the carotid more readily palpable — that’s the one TV detectives check when they walk in on a murder scene, right before sadly shaking their heads.Here’s what to do:Rapid electrical activity in your heart doesn’t always translate into palpable pulses, so the number you count doesn’t always give you the whole picture. Talking to a physician and getting a proper evaluation is important to making a diagnosis. Your doctor may order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, taken at the time you’re feeling symptoms.Sometimes people with abnormal rhythms don’t feel their heart racing, as often happens with atrial fibrillation (smart devices are improving their ability to alert users to this possibility). In these and many other cases, your doctor may want you to wear a heart monitor at home for a few days or weeks that can catch the abnormal rhythm if and when it occurs unexpectedly."
WaPo_53,Fake images are getting harder to spot. Here’s a field guide.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/29/how-to-spot-fake-pictures-guide/,2024-07-29 19:00:02.981227,,"Photographs have a profound power to shape our understanding of the world. And it’s never been more important to be able to discern which ones are genuine and which are doctored to push an agenda, especially in the wake of dramatic or contentious moments.But advances in technology mean that spotting manipulated or even totally AI-generated imagery is only getting trickier.Take for example a photo of Catherine, Princess of Wales, issued by Kensington Palace in March. News organizations retracted it after experts noted some obvious manipulations. And some questioned whether images captured during the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump were genuine.Here are a few things experts suggest the next time you come across an image that leaves you wondering.It might sound basic, but a study by researcher Sophie Nightingale at Lancaster University in Britain found that, across age groups, the people who took the time to zoom into photos and carefully scrutinize different parts were better at spotting altered images.Try it the next time you get a weird feeling about a photo. Just be sure not to focus on the wrong things. To help, we’ve created this (slightly exaggerated) sample image to highlight some common signs of image manipulation.Rather than focusing on things like shadows and lighting, Nightingale suggested looking at “photometric” clues like blurring around the edges of objects that might suggest they’ve been added later; noticeable pixelation in some parts of an image but not others; and differences in coloration.Consider this parrot: For one, who brings a parrot to a polling location?And take a closer look at its wings; the blurred edges of its leading feathers contrast with the round cutouts closer to its body. This is clearly an amateurish Photoshop job.Fine details are among the hardest things to seamlessly edit in an image, so they get flubbed frequently. This is often easy to spot when regular, repeating patterns are disrupted or distorted.In the image below, note how the shapes of the bricks in the wall behind the divider are warped and squished. Something fishy happened here.Consider the now-infamous photo of Princess Catherine.The princess appeared with her arms draped around her two of her children. Online sleuths were quick to point out inconsistencies, including floor tiles that appear to overlap and a bit of molding that appears misaligned.In our polling place example, did you catch that this person had an extra finger? Sure, it’s possible they have a condition like polydactyly, in which people are born with extra fingers or toes. That’s a bit unlikely though, so if you spot things like extra digits, it could be a sign that AI was used to alter the image.It’s not just bad Photoshopping that screws up fine touches. AI is notoriously iffy when it comes to manipulating detailed images.So far, that’s been especially true of structures like the human hand — though it’s getting better at them. Still, it’s not uncommon for images generated by, or edited with, AI to show the wrong number of fingers.One way to determine the authenticity of an image is to take a step back and consider what’s around it. The context an image is placed in can tell you a lot about the intent behind sharing it. Consider the social media post that we created below for our altered image.Ask yourself: Do you know anything about the person who shared the photo? Is it attached to a post that seems meant to spark an emotional reaction? What does the caption, if any, say?Some doctored images, or even genuine images placed in a context that differs from reality, are meant to appeal to our “intuitive, gut thinking,” says Peter Adams, senior vice president of research and design at the News Literacy Project, a nonprofit that promotes critical media evaluation. These edits can artificially engender support or elicit sympathy for specific causes.Nightingale recommends asking yourself a few questions when you spot an image that gets a rise out of you: “Why might somebody have posted this? Is there any ulterior motive that might suggest this could be a fake?”In many cases, Adams adds, comments or replies attached to the photo can reveal a fake for what it is.Here’s one real-life example pulled from X. An AI-generated image of Trump flanked by six young Black men first appeared in October 2023 but reappeared in January, attached to a post stating that the former president had stopped his motorcade to meet the men in an impromptu meet-and-greet.But it didn’t take long for commenters to point out inconsistencies, like the fact that Trump appeared to have only three large fingers on his right hand.In some cases, genuine images come from out of the blue in a way that leaves us wondering if they really happened. Finding the source of those images can help shed crucial light.Earlier this year, science educator Bill Nye appeared on the cover of Time Out New York dressed more stylishly than the baby-blue lab coat many of us remember. Some wondered if the images were AI-generated, but following the trail of credits back to the photographer’s Instagram account revealed that the Science Guy really was wearing edgy, youthful clothes.Dripped out Bill Nye by me for Time Out New York pic.twitter.com/4uuGOqgooFFor images that claim to have come from a real news event, it’s also worth checking news services like the Associated Press and Reuters and companies like Getty Images — all of which let you peek at the editorial images they’ve captured.If you happen to find the originating image, you’re looking at an authentic one.If an image seems out of character for the person in it, appears pointedly partisan or just generally doesn’t pass a vibe check, reverse image tools — like TinEye or Google Image Search — can help you find the originals. Even if they can’t, these tools may still surface valuable context about the image.Here’s a recent example: Shortly after a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate Trump, an image appeared on the Meta-owned social media service Threads that depicted Secret Service agents smiling while clinging to the former president. That image was used to bolster the baseless theory that the shooting was staged.The original photo contains not a single visible smile.Even armed with these tips, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to tell real images from manipulated ones 100 percent of the time. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep your sense of skepticism honed. It’s part of the work we all need to do at times to remember that, even in divisive and confusing times, factual truth still exists.Losing sight of that, Nightingale says, only gives bad actors the opportunity to “dismiss everything.”“That’s where society is really at risk,” she said.Editing by Karly Domb Sadof and Yun-Hee Kim."
WaPo_54,Trump and Vance seem ready to offend as many women voters as possible,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/turmp-vance-women-misogyny/,2024-07-29 19:44:02.981227,,"If you wanted to design a presidential ticket most likely to offend women voters, you would pick as the presidential nominee an adjudicated rapist, someone caught bragging about sexually assaulting women and who comes with a history of demeaning and insulting women. You would make it someone who mused about punishing women for having an abortion and who boasts about taking away women’s bodily integrity.Then, for vice president, you would find someone who has implied women should to stay in abusive relationships (he denies that’s what he meant but listen for yourself), wants to ban abortion even in cases of rape and incest, favors a “federal response” to prevent women from traveling to states where abortion is legal, accuses single women (“childless cat ladies”) of lacking a stake in America’s future, votes against protection for in vitro fertilization and wants higher taxes for childless people. (He later said he had not meant to offend cats.)Well, that’s the MAGA Republican Party ticket of convicted felon and former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Trump, having normalized overtly racist speech and demonization of immigrants during his campaigns and presidency, now seems bent on making misogyny acceptable, as well.Indeed, the MAGA movement’s anti-woman outlook relies on a whole pseudo-academic underpinning to justify relegating women to the home as baby-making machines. “Vance, along with his New Right fellow-travelers, is about to introduce voters to a more conceptual take on sexism — one which many women, and indeed many men, might find even more alarming,” Laura K. Field wrote last week for Politico. Field detailed the right-wing groups that have concocted a philosophical framework to propound “a deep skepticism about modern feminism and gender equality”; its aim is “to roll back much of feminism’s gains.”Their declaration for a “revival of faith, family, and fertility” comes straight from the fascism playbook, which historically has sought to domesticate women and put them under the thumb of their fathers and husbands. “Control over female bodies in the name of population growth is a throughline of authoritarianism, as are persecutions of LGBTQ+ individuals,” writes historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat. “In Europe and America, the century-long focus of the far right on demographic emergencies supposedly created by declines of White births and upticks in non-White immigration have created support for controls on female bodies.” She continues: “These controls are predicated on negating the personhood of women and consigning them to roles as vessels of population growth.”From the “great replacement theory” to abortion bans, the Make America Great Again movement echoes past demographic freakouts and accompanying efforts to dominate women. As Ben-Ghiat puts it, the MAGA crew, like its intellectual ancestors, insists that for “White Christian civilization to continue, women must be deprived of reproductive rights and demeaned, disciplined, and criminalized if they resist.”But you don’t have to rely on historians. Project 2025, which Vance has championed and many close Trump advisers put together, explicitly commits to restore the centrality of a male-headed, heterosexual family with children. (“Families composed of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society.”) Running through every policy recommendation, the plan gives preference to the “traditional family,” (often called “healthy family”), deeming all other family units as “unnatural.”The 900-page manifesto declares: “It’s time for policymakers to elevate family authority, formation, and cohesion as their top priority and even use government power, including through the tax code, to restore the American family,” reads the manifesto. It says the secretary of Health and Human Services “should proudly state that men and women are biological realities that are crucial to the advancement of life sciences and medical care and that married men and women are the ideal, natural family structure because all children have a right to be raised by the men and women who conceived them.” No wonder Vance disparages blended families.At times, the 2025 Project sounds downright Orwellian:If they delete the words, do they imagine abortion and gender issues will vanish?Needless to say, the reaction to these backward ideas and the effort to denigrate Vice President Harris as a “DEI candidate” have not gone over well with women (or many men). A week ago, “more than 44,000 Black women joined a call to galvanize supporters for the vice president’s historic run for president, drawing celebrity names — including Yvette Nicole Brown and Jenifer Lewis — and raising an estimated $1.5 million,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. “At the white women call Thursday night, there were more than 100,000 participants, a number so staggering it caused significant technical glitches that sent many to watch the live stream on YouTube, where more than 25,000 also joined the call.” (Reports indicated that by Friday they had raised more than $8.5 million.)Certainly, Harris personally has generated much of the excitement. The prospect of a woman of color beating Trump to win the presidency has supercharged women voters. But this ticket’s odious rhetoric certainly has contributed to the rising tide of fury, defiance and resentment among women. When Harris declares “We’re not going back,” the message has particular resonance among women.The backlash against Trump is nothing new. In my book “Resistance: How Women Saved Democracy from Donald Trump,” I documented the organic organizing among women that surged in the wake of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016. The networks of women, the organizations they created, the entry into politics of a new generation of women politicians and the muscle memory for grassroots activity remain, now invigorated by the Harris campaign. A GOP ticket even more misogynistic, repressive and hateful than its 2016 version has lit a fire under these women.If women prevail in handing MAGA forces a defeat (as they did overwhelmingly in the 2018 midterms and in 2020), they might have Trump and Vance to thank. They have roused the sleeping (mama) bear, now more determined than ever to preserve democracy and keep misogynists out of the White House."
WaPo_55,Region braces for Netanyahu to decide Israeli response to Golan Heights strike,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-lebanon/,2024-07-29 19:02:02.981227,,"JERUSALEM — Civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border braced Monday for the Israeli army to launch a counterstrike — of a scale, scope and intensity that is still unknown — after Israel’s security cabinet authorized a military response to the weekend rocket attack from Lebanon that killed that killed 12 people, most of them teenagers and children.The region was gripped with uncertainty, hoping for a calibrated, pinpoint response but prepping for a widespread assault that diplomats warned could erupt into a regional war. Residents of Beirut stocked up on emergency supplies in case the expected strikes reached as far the Lebanese capital. Hezbollah militants threatened to target Haifa and other Israeli cities if it did.Multiple airlines suspended flights in and out of Beirut. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted to supporters that Turkey could “enter” Israel if necessary.“The concerns that it could spin out of control are very high,” said an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Israel’s security cabinet authorized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister late Sunday to decide on the “manner and timing” of Israel’s response to Saturday’s rocket strike on a crowded soccer field in Majdal Shams, a Druze village in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.“For me, a Jewish child murdered … on October 7 or a Druze child murdered in the Golan Heights is the same thing,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday on a visit to the village. “Hezbollah will pay a price for this — our actions will speak.”Israel’s military struck a number of Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon on Sunday. Hussein Fakih, a spokesman for Lebanon’s civil defense, said in an interview that two people were killed and three people, including a child, were injured in a Monday strike on the road between Chaqra and Meiss El Jabal, in southeastern Lebanon. Later Monday, Hezbollah announced the deaths of two of its members.But Israel’s response so far has stopped short of the fierce retaliation Netanyahu pledged after the strike, the deadliest single attack on Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage. The Israel Defense Forces released a list on Sunday of victims who were 10 to 16 years old.Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has denied any connection to the attack, which followed months of cross-border skirmishes between the militant group and Israel’s military. Israeli and American officials say the evidence that the weapon was an Iranian rocket fired from a Hezbollah position is incontrovertible.Netanyahu is under pressure from tens of thousands of border residents who have been displaced from their homes for months to mount a decisive blow. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has pushed previously for Israel to drive Hezbollah away from the frontier and degrade its considerable military capabilities.But a flurry of diplomatic efforts from Washington, Paris and regional capitals commenced within hours of the attack, according to Western and Israeli officials familiar with the efforts to calm the situation. U.S. officials said Israel has a right to respond to the attack but also urged its ally to show restraint.Early signals suggested that Jerusalem may be listening. The Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted unnamed Israeli officials describing the likely operation as “limited but significant.”Israel’s dilemma, according to current and former security officials, is how to answer the attack without leaving Hezbollah with no choice but to escalate in turn — which might draw Iran more directly into the fight. The Israeli military keeps a range of target scenarios on the shelf, regularly updated with new intelligence, according to a military official who described readiness planning to The Washington Post on a visit to the border zone in the spring.Planners will also be looking at recent responses. Earlier this month, following a drone attack launched by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen that killed one person in Tel Aviv, Israel responded a day later with a withering strike that severely damaged a major Yemeni port.In April, after Israel and allies shot down most of an unprecedented barrage of missiles and drones fired from Iran, the military answered with a calibrated counterstrike that showed its ability to reach into Iranian territory but did minimal damage. Both sides stood down.One day after scenes from a mass funeral and devastated mourners from Majdal Shams, tensions remained high.Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, hit back at vague suggestions Sunday from Erdogan that Turkey could enter Israel as it had done in the past in Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan.Katz and Turkish leaders, who have been sharply critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, have been exchanging hot-tempered statements for months.“Just as the genocidal Hitler met his end, so will the genocidal Netanyahu,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry posted Monday on social media.Erdogan did not provide any more detail in his remarks, which were made in a televised address in his hometown, according to Reuters. A Turkish political analyst downplayed the significance of the comment, saying it was in keeping with Erdogan’s recent bellicose rhetoric toward Israel.Lebanon’s main airline, Middle East Airlines, rescheduled flights to and from Beirut on Sunday and Monday, citing “technical reasons related to the distribution of insurance risks.” Among the departures affected by the delays were Monday flights to Cairo; Nice, France; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. German airline Lufthansa said in a statement that it was suspending flights to Beirut through Aug. 5 — including from subsidiaries Swiss and Eurowings — because of “current developments in the Middle East.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his condolences for those killed in the Majdal Shams attack in a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday, in addition to emphasizing “the importance of preventing escalation of the conflict,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. British Foreign Minister David Lammy said on social media he spoke to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati about the escalating tensions, with both agreeing that “widening of the conflict in the region is in nobody’s interest.”The majority of the Gaza Strip is under evacuation orders from Israel, with only 14 percent unaffected, according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA. The orders are “creating havoc + panic,” and people often have very little time to flee, he added. More than 200,000 Palestinians were displaced over the past week because of the orders, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on social media.Conditions in Israeli prisons have deteriorated dangerously since Oct. 7, rights groups say, as detailed in a Post report. The Post spoke to former Palestinian prisoners and lawyers and reviewed autopsy reports and court records to reveal rampant violence and deprivation in Israel’s prison system, with routine beatings — usually with batons and sometimes with dogs — as well as psychological abuse and denial of sufficient food and medical care.At least 39,363 people have been killed and 90,923 injured in Gaza since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, including more than 300 soldiers, and says 329 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operation in Gaza.Kareem Fahim and Suzan Haidamous in Beirut and Michael Birnbaum in Tokyo contributed to this report."
WaPo_56,New contracts might make buying a home more confusing than ever,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/29/home-buyers-contracts-agents/,2024-07-29 20:04:02.738250,,"Would-be homeowners will soon face a new hurdle: wading through lengthy, potentially confusing real estate contracts even before they tour a home.Currently, most buyers can choose a Realtor without making any commitments in writing. But starting Aug. 17, buyers will have to sign a mandatory agreement first — and it could include hard-to-understand provisions that favor agents and cost buyers money, legal experts and consumer advocates say.The newly mandatory contracts are the result of a March court settlement with the National Association of Realtors that consumer advocates hope will end practices that led to seller agents paying their buyer counterparts half of the commission fee from a home sale. Proponents of ending that automatic split hope that having buyers pay their own agents will spur negotiations that could lead to lower commissions.Contract templates now being circulated by Realtor groups would have buyers pay some of the commissions rather than just sellers, as is the case currently. But consumer advocates worry that most buyers simply aren’t equipped to vet the legal documents their agents ask them to sign, leaving them at the mercy of industry norms.“​​Nobody in their right mind is reading these forms,” said University of Buffalo law professor Tanya Monestier, who has reviewed more than a dozen of the new contract templates.The Justice Department has apparently taken notice of the new contracts. Monestier said the DOJ in July responded to notes she sent about contracts issued by several state associations, including the one drafted by the California association. Moreover, the California Realtor Association’s general counsel Brian Manson said in a June 21 article in the trade publication Inman that the association had received an inquiry from the department.Lotus Lou, a spokeswoman for the association, confirmed Manson’s comments. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.Monestier described a draft from the California Association of Realtors, for example, as “dense, complicated and all over the place” to the point of incomprehensibility. “I think that’s by design,” said Monestier, who evaluated the California template at the request of the Consumer Federation of America.In its June statement, the association rejected Monestier’s assessment, calling her critique of the forms “misguided,” “absurd” and insufficiently familiar with California law. The organization has made several changes that address advocates’ concerns, the group said.Manson told The Washington Post that the group has spent months working on its draft contracts and has made several changes.“The revised forms are greatly simplified, making them more transparent and easier for consumers to understand with the help” of their Realtors, Manson said in an emailed statement.The Post reviewed template contracts and other industry guidance from Realtor groups in eight states. The Post sought feedback on the draft contracts from lawyers, real estate agents, consumer advocates, and others with knowledge of the industry.Some in the industry believe requiring buyer contracts will do little to change commissions, which are typically 6 percent of the sale price, with 3 percent going to the seller agent and 3 percent to the buyer Realtor. NAR and its affiliates said that commissions have always been negotiable, and many buyer agents already ask their clients to sign upfront agreements.Edward Rogers, the head of a real estate brokerage firm in the Philadelphia area, said he expects that negotiations on the buyer side will be rare even after the new rules go into effect. “I do believe it will happen, but I don’t think it will happen often,” he said.Having commissions paid entirely from the seller side helps new home buyers, Rogers said. “Our marketplace is a lot of first-time home buyers, a lot of middle-class working families trying to buy homes, and they truly can’t afford, or they might not have the savings” to pay a commission.The changes will ultimately benefit the industry and consumers by adding more transparency to the commission process, Rogers said. He advised home buyers to go over the new contracts with their agents and understand them fully before signing.Southern California real estate agent Iain Phillips stressed the importance of easy-to-understand contracts. His brokerage has long used buyer-agent contracts but he said an initial draft of the California Association of Realtors’ buyer agreement was a “nightmare” with its length and confusing language.“Especially for someone who has never purchased a home before,” he said, “they’ll be looking at that with a lot of questions.”Consumer advocates say it’s important that home buyers understand what they are agreeing to before signing with an agent. “Understandable agreements have the ability to empower buyers and transform their relationship to agents,” said Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group.The group is recommending that brokers and their clients have the right to terminate the contracts at any time, without penalty. The broker’s fee should also be clearly stated as a dollar figure or hourly rate, the group says, while any additional fees should be subtracted from the commission paid in a sale.Brobeck’s organization also argues that seller concessions, which can include the seller paying the buyer agent’s commission, should be approved by buyers themselves and not their brokers. The consumer federation also opposes mandatory mediation or arbitration clauses.Some draft contracts, reviewed by The Post, contain heavy fees and other provisions that might worry home buyers.A draft from Oregon suggests that a buyer who backs out after making a formal offer should be charged $2,500. A draft from Texas says a client would be liable for “the amount of compensation that Broker would have received under this agreement if Client was not in default” in certain situations where a deal falls through.Monestier, the University of Buffalo law professor, said home buyers who back out of a deal through their own fault could owe tens of thousands of dollars beyond even their deposit. “No consumer would ever appreciate the consequences of this default provision. … It would come as a complete surprise to them,” she said.Lori Levy, general counsel for Texas Realtors, said “there may be limited circumstances where a buyer’s actions would rise to the level of breach for which the broker should be able to be compensated under the agreement,” adding that failing to purchase a home generally wouldn’t constitute a breach of contract.Others are concerned that the contracts will undercut a central part of the NAR agreement.Under the current system, Realtors putting homes on the organization’s multiple listing service (MLS) — a nationwide repository of properties for sale — frequently offer to split commissions with buyer agents. The lawsuit settlement will end the practice of including those compensation offers in the database listings.Advocates have argued that if buyer agents no longer get the traditional commission split, they will be forced to negotiate rates with their own clients. While the new templates from state Realtor groups do have provisions about home buyers paying their own Realtors, the contracts also could allow buyer agents to be paid directly by sellers outside of the MLS.“Nothing in the NAR settlement prohibits home sellers from compensating buyer brokers off the MLS,” said Nick Gaglio, outside antitrust counsel for Florida Realtors. “Such offers are a pro-competitive way to increase buyers’ interest in a house and thus improve returns for home sellers.”One draft contract from Texas simply replaces commissions with “bonuses” that the buyer agent can collect from the seller, Monestier said.Levy, the Texas Realtors general counsel, said the language on bonuses puts buyers in control by providing transparency about compensation. The draft form notes that bonuses can only be provided if there is written permission from the client.“The forms shine a light on what a buyer’s broker will earn and give the client control to agree to a bonus or not,” Levy said.A template from Florida contains a line specifying that the broker can get “separate compensation” from the property owner. Gaglio said the provision for outside compensation has “nothing to do with the NAR settlement” and “merely reflects a common situation in which a broker provides separate services” to the buyer and seller.One concern raised by consumer advocates is that the emerging templates contain workarounds allowing buyers to collude with sellers, effectively maintaining the current industry norm in which agents for each side get paid 3 percent of the home sale price.A summer 2024 newsletter from the Georgia Association of Realtors says members could put their listing on a personal website and include a statement as to how buyer brokers will be compensated, for example, or use an MLS listing that promises a certain amount of money for “closing costs” without mentioning buyer broker compensation.The language in the drafts aligns with some Realtor predictions that the industry could largely maintain the status quo. Though some rules might be different, “it’s going to be business as usual,” said Phillips, the California agent."
WaPo_57,Why not run a team against Trump?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-team-running-mate-comics/,2024-07-29 20:00:02.738250,,"The most consequential decision Vice President Harris will make in the first weeks of her new campaign will be choosing a running mate. And the predictable questions surrounding that choice are already budding like cherry blossoms in springtime.Who can deliver a swing state? Who can outwit JD Vance in a debate? Who is capable enough to take the wheel someday yet restrained enough to ride shotgun in the meantime?As Harris ponders her selection, let me issue a gentle warning: These familiar questions frame the decision too narrowly.An uncommon candidate (Black, Asian American, female) in an unusual campaign (a 100-day sprint rather than a 100-week slog) against an unprecedented opponent (a thrice-nominated, twice-impeached, once-nearly-assassinated former president) calls for an unconventional approach.Instead of choosing one person, why not pick a team?Donald Trump has said many nutty things over the years, but among the most alarming were five words he uttered in his 2016 Republican National Convention acceptance speech. After reciting a litany of national miseries, Trump assured America: “I alone can fix it.”Four years later, he told devotees, “I’m the only thing standing between the American Dream and total anarchy, madness and chaos.” And in his speech at this month’s convention, after vividly describing how a madman’s bullet lacerated his ear, he suggested that “I had God on my side” — an echo of his earlier statement that “I am the Chosen One.”Confronted with such a cartoonish megalomaniac, Harris could draw a lesson from the best comic books: Fight back with a team. Their five-word promise: “Together we can fix it.”Harris could select her prospective vice president, as presidential candidates always do. That person’s name would appear with hers on ballots. But at next month’s Democratic National Convention, she could also announce the core members of her eventual government, including people who didn’t get the VP nod.Imagine an ensemble of All Stars. She could tap swing-state celebrities across the country, such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona as her potential defense secretary, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky or Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina as attorney general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania as transportation secretary.She could elevate a few popular Biden officials — make Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo secretary of the treasury, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy secretary of health and human services, and multilingual Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg secretary of state.It could be an opportunity to introduce fresh faces — perhaps Los Angeles Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho as education secretary, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger as solicitor general, Adm. Lisa Franchetti as national security adviser and General Motors CEO Mary Barra as commerce secretary.Now imagine this entire crew appearing alongside Harris and her veep choice at the convention, waving together from the stage as balloons descend from the rafters, and then fanning out across the country to campaign for the next 10 weeks.In a compressed and competitive race, a dream team helmed by Harris has several advantages over the usual dynamic duo.1. A team offers good government, which is almost always good politics.Trump’s presidency exposed the absurdity of his “I alone” boast. His unwillingness to listen, to tolerate opposing views or to demonstrate even the barest humility stalled his policies and produced record turnover in his administration.By replacing the arrogance of isolation with the confidence of delegation, Harris can set herself up to succeed as president. Research in organizational behavior and social psychology demonstrates that individuals often outperform teams in solving simple problems. But teams are better at tackling complex challenges. Groups bring diverse experiences and clashing perspectives, which generate more options and yield smarter solutions for complicated problems.So, to determine whom to fire on a reality TV show, rely on a triumphant loner. But to repair a broken immigration system, strengthen wobbling democratic institutions, manage ever-shifting geopolitical alliances, prepare for the rise of artificial intelligence or address just about any 21st-century issue, a squad beats a squawker.At the same time, this novel approach shines a light not just on her opponent’s past performance but also on his future policies. Trump allies have laid out two equally disturbing plans of governance. One is Project 2025, 900 pages of authoritarian revenge porn that rolls back rights, rewinds regulations and rewards the president with the powers of a king. The other is the platform the party unveiled at its convention this month — a shaggy collection of randomly capitalized catchphrases and outbursts that read as if Bart Simpson scratched them on a chalkboard.A fleet of pragmatic policy wonks ready to govern on Day 1 delivers a stark contrast — more mainstream than Project 2025, more substantive than an ALL CAPS party platform.2. A team recasts the conversation about age and vigor.Many national elections distill to a single question: Forward or back?With Biden out of the race, Trump is the oldest presidential nominee ever. In the space of two weeks, he has become the last gasp of baby boom politics, the very embodiment of “back.” Democrats can press that case.Picture a split screen. On one half is an elderly Florida man dishing out a word salad with a side of grievance. On the other half is a lineup of accomplished, energetic professionals — a physician, a carmaker, even an astronaut, almost none of them yet eligible for Social Security — rolling up their sleeves and getting to work.On one side is a 78-year-old politician who has attempted to launder his age by selecting a 39-year-old yes-man as a running mate — enlisting him less as a partner than as a sidekick. On the other side is a Gen X woman tough enough to assemble a team of rivals to serve her country.Present that contrast relentlessly until Election Day and the question bubbles to the top of the conversation: Forward or back?3. A team mitigates some of the nominee’s political disadvantages.Women leaders often confront what social scientists call a “double bind.” Though people in general, and voters in particular, readily accept that a male leader can be both likable and effective, they assume that women face an inherent trade-off. If you’re warm, you must not be competent. If you’re competent, you must not be warm. And we want our leaders to be both.A contingent of running mates gives Harris a way to untangle this unfair knot by outsourcing some of the effort. When she’s displaying the steely competence of a prosecutor, her partners can project warmth. When she’s showing the kindness, laughter and dance moves of “Momala,” her colleagues can demonstrate competence.Likewise, a unit can insulate Harris from the inevitable attacks. It’s tougher to portray her as a woo-woo San Francisco liberal if she’s leading a squadron of political centrists, corporate executives and military veterans.In movies and comics, heroes like Batman and Wonder Woman can battle most bad guys on their own. But facing a supervillain requires a team. The signal goes out. The band assembles. And the work begins.That’s the secret to victory in November: Kamala’s own Justice League of America."
WaPo_58,"Alma Powell, civic leader and wife of the late Colin Powell, dies at 86",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/29/alma-powell-death/,2024-07-29 21:28:02.667472,,"Alma Powell — a civic leader who was married to the late former secretary of state and military leader Colin Powell for nearly six decades — died Sunday at 86.Mrs. Powell died in Alexandria, Va., after a brief illness, according to Peggy Cifrino, former chief aide to Colin Powell, who died in 2021. The exact cause of her death was not immediately available.Mrs. Powell, recognized for her work to empower young people, had a wide-ranging career. She was a radio host, an audiologist and a children’s book author and served on the board of America’s Promise Alliance, which focuses on civic engagement, education and workforce development.She married Powell, then a lieutenant in the Army, shortly before he left for his first deployment to Vietnam in 1962, according to an obituary shared by Cifrino.As a military spouse, she moved more than 20 times, setting up homes for their three children — Michael, Linda and Annemarie — in Virginia, North Carolina, Kansas, Kentucky, Colorado, Georgia and Germany.Mrs. Powell was an active volunteer, known for helping military families prepare for a move by providing information about how to settle in the military bases where she had lived. At one time, Mrs. Powell was also a member of the Arlington Ladies, who attend funerals of service members at Arlington National Cemetery.Her husband rose to the rank of general in the Army — ultimately becoming the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989. He was appointed secretary of state by President George W. Bush in 2001.As her husband retired from the military in 1993 and reentered civilian life, Mrs. Powell began to focus more on education and improving children’s lives. The couple were key to launching America’s Promise Alliance in 1997, and Mrs. Powell held several positions on its board, including her most recent post of chair emeritus. She also wrote two children’s books to support the mission of the organization, called “America’s Promise” and “My Little Red Wagon,” aimed at encouraging children to give back to their communities, according to publisher HarperCollins.Mrs. Powell sat on numerous boards and won many service awards. From 1989 to 2000, she was chair of the National Council of the Best Friends Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of young girls.Mrs. Powell, who was appointed to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board during Bill Clinton’s presidency, was also picked to be on an advisory board for historically Black colleges and universities in 2010 by President Barack Obama.She received the first ServiceNation Award for Excellence in Military and Civilian Service in 2009. In 2010, Mrs. Powell received a Commonwealth Academy Recognition for Educators award by demonstrating outstanding “leadership in efforts to empower young people, including those who struggle with learning differences and AD/HD,” according to congressional records.Alma Vivian Johnson, the oldest of two daughters, was born on Oct 27, 1937. She left her home in Birmingham, Ala., in 1953 to study speech and drama at Fisk University in Nashville at 16 years old. Her father was the principal of one of Birmingham’s Black high schools, and her mother ran a day care, according to the obituary sent by Cifrino.When she returned, she took a job as a host at a radio station. Her afternoon show, “Luncheon with Alma,” played music and discussed household tips.She was living in Boston, studying pathology and audiology at Emerson College and working for the Boston Guild for the Hard of Hearing as an audiologist when she was set up on a blind date with Colin Powell in 1961.Their marriage the next year, at the First Congregational Church in her hometown, kept her from completing her graduate education. Decades later, however, Mrs. Powell received an honorary degree from Emerson College. She was also the recipient of an honorary doctorate in humanities from Shenandoah University.In 2013, at a luncheon celebrating Mrs. Powell’s 75th birthday and her 50th wedding anniversary, she was praised by guests as a role model, a “true Southern lady” and “a woman who speaks her mind,” The Washington Post reported.Mrs. Powell was known to support her husband throughout his military career, but she was opposed to him running for president, The Post reported, and despite entreaties from many Republicans, he never did. A few months before his death, The Post asked the former general, “Who was the greatest man, woman or person you have ever known? Not … a leader, not necessarily, but the inner person.”“It’s Alma Powell,” he said immediately. “She was with me the whole time. We’ve been married 58 years. And she put up with a lot. She took care of the kids when I was, you know, running around. And she was always there for me and she’d tell me, ‘That’s not a good idea.’ She was usually right.”"
WaPo_59,A view from Paris: Looks a lot like parity — finally,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/daily-olympics-visual-guide-paris-2024-gender-parity-women/,2024-07-29 21:14:02.667472,,"I’m Pete, and The Washington Post sent me to Paris to show you some of the wonders and weirdness you couldn’t otherwise see without being here. You can find my previous dispatches here:Good morning from sunny — yes, sunny! — Paris.I’m filing this report from a shady spot at the skateboarding venue. I’m getting the hang of this on-site reporter thing and preparing much better. I have a croissant in my bag, Vans on my feet and I’m wearing my Wu-Tang Clan shirt to blend in with all the skaters in the crowd.I’ve been thinking about one of the themes of this Olympics: women’s fight for equality in society and sports. Parity was a goal of the Paris Games.I was in the stands at the women’s skateboarding street final. I saw the toughness as the skaters  fell hard and got back up, and their body-bending athleticism was incredible. The crowd held its breath on every run, gasping at every fall, and there were ooooooohs and cheers every time a skater nailed a trick. Fans chanted the name of Brazil’s Rayssa Leal. They did the wave.How could anyone have ever thought women couldn’t compete?It took well over a century for the Olympics to go from no women to nearly equal participation. Here are some of the milestones:Many symbols in this Olympics nod to French history.But I counted zero skaters in the crowd.The Brazilian fans were especially amped up for the skateboarding, and they should be. Leal was among the favorites, and she won a bronze medal.Brazil is among the countries that have sent more women athletes than men to France, and skateboarding is one of the sports that include the same number of women and men.I wondered if teens would be too young to have experienced a time before the push for equality, so I asked Leal, 16, a question in — drum roll, please — my first Olympic athletes’ news conference!Her answer surprised me: “When I was small many people told me I shouldn’t skate because skating was for boys and for men,” Leal said. “Overcoming this is very important, and this will be forever in our memories. I feel very privileged to be part of this Olympics with gender parity.”Parity doesn’t mean all sports are completely equal and they don’t always look the same.For example, rhythmic gymnastics is for women only, and artistic swimming (formerly synchronized swimming) just allowed men to compete this year (although none made it to Paris).But the International Olympic Committee considers 28 of the 32 overall sports categories to be gender equal.I made another important discovery: All creatures in France apparently appreciate croissants, because my bag is now full of ants.But wait! Breaking news: I finally found skaters! And they were old enough to know Wu-Tang Clan! So much of the music was from the 1990s that I felt quite retro-cool (even though I was pretty sweaty).But where were all the city’s skaters? Maybe I can find some Monday.About this storyData on sports participation came from the official Olympics site and was updated as of July 28.

WaPo_60,How Flavor Flav and Maggie Steffens found a new kind of Olympic synergy,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/07/29/flavor-flav-water-polo-maggie-steffens-olympics/,2024-07-29 22:18:02.991095,,"PARIS — It was the yellow ball, for her. It was the piano keys, for him. That first touch of the future.“Ever since I was 5 years old, man,” he says.“From diapers,” she says.That’s when they knew where they were headed.Sports, specifically water polo, for Maggie Steffens.Music, specifically hip-hop, for William Jonathan Drayton Jr., a.k.a. Flavor Flav (a.k.a. Flaavorrrr Flaaaav).Steffens, 31, was born to a water polo family in Northern California a few months after Flav went to his fourth Grammys ceremony as a nominee with the monumental hip-hop group Public Enemy, which fought the power and then accumulated its own.Three decades later, Flav and Steffens have found themselves together at the Paris Olympics — two veterans of their chosen endeavors using their own power to find new fans. Steffens is the captain of the U.S. women’s water polo team, and Flav, 65, is the team’s sponsor and official hype man.Maybe you’ve seen a lot of Flavor Flav over the past several days. If so, that means you’ve seen more women’s water polo than you’re used to. That’s synergy. It’s the magic that buoys niche sports and keeps old careers afloat.There’s Flav now, way up there in the muggy nosebleeds at the Aquatics Center in Saint-Denis, wearing a water polo cap, a golden glint on his clock-faced sunglasses, swooping his arms and shouting a signature hype-man phrase at the women — “Yyyyeahhhh boyyyy” — as they play Greece.There’s Steffens down in the chlorine, cleaving and thrashing, egg-beating her legs so she can rise from the water, swivel her throwing arm like a threatened cobra, and collapse the distance between ball and net through deltoids and determination.“These girls are my girls,” Flav says. The signature clock around his neck says it’s time — you guessed it — for water polo.
“His energy and positivity is infectious,” says Steffens, who has scored more goals in the Olympics than any other female water polo player in history. “And that’s something we want to bring to the game. We want to be a joy to watch.”
American women have won three consecutive Olympic gold medals in water polo, and they’re going for a fourth in Paris. This is dynasty territory. But they do not get the attention or the money bestowed on, say, the men’s basketball team.That’s where synergy comes in. Partnerships between sponsors and Olympic athletes are way down compared with the Olympics in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016, according to Brant Feldman, Steffens’s agent. On May 4, at Feldman’s urging, Steffens posted an Instagram photo of her team with a caption that courted new support.“Many of my teammates aren’t just badass champions, but also teachers, business owners, coaches, physicians assistants,” Steffens wrote, and “most Olympians need a 2nd (or 3rd) job to support chasing the dream (myself included!) and most teams rely on sponsors for travel, accommodations, nutritional support, rent/lodging, and simply affording to live in this day and age. Especially female sports.”Feldman made sure the post was seen by his friend Rhiannon Rae Ellis, a talent manager. Ellis thought of one client in particular.“I have crazy ideas,” Ellis says, “and Flav says yes to almost all of them.” So she asked: Why don’t we sponsor an Olympian?And Flav said: Let’s do the whole team.He then commented on Steffens’s post: “AYYY YOOO,,, as a girl dad and supporter of all women’s sports - imma personally sponsor you my girl,,, whatever you need. And imma sponsor the whole team. My manager is in touch with your agent.”How this is playing out here in Paris is different from all the self-promoting corporate synergy NBCUniversal creates every time you see a Kelly Clarkson or a Snoop Dogg or a Minion as you’re watching the Games. If there’s a gold medal for creating synergy from scratch, give it to Feldman and Ellis. Flav signed a five-year sponsorship deal with USA Water Polo, gave the team a monetary donation and committed to hyping the women and the sport. Within two weeks of Steffens’s Instagram post, Flav was spotted at Yankee Stadium wearing a “USA Water Polo” shirt.” His Instagram became a water polo bonanza.“Flavor Flav is the first celebrity of any sort to do something like this,” Feldman says, referring to Flav’s partnership with a national governing body of sport (in this case, USA Water Polo). “This may become the norm in the future.”On Sunday, as if to prove the point, U.S. rugby player Ilona Maher posted an Instagram video in which she asked former NFL player Jason Kelce if he would publicly endorse her team. Maher began her pitch: “Women’s water polo has Flavor Flav as their superfan.” (Kelce rattled off a quick endorsement.)A couple weeks ago in Berkeley, Calif., Flav jumped in the pool to practice with the team, as video was captured for everyone’s socials.Treading water with women a third his age, Flav said: “This. Is Not. Easy.” The video on Flav’s Insta has at least 121,000 views.“I read through the comments [on the post] and I see people asking questions about water polo, and people of color wanting to start playing,” said goalkeeper Ashleigh Johnson, who in 2016 became the first Black woman to make the Olympic water polo team. “And that’s a different community than I’ve seen talk about our sport — in the way they were talking about it — than I have this whole time I’ve been on this team.”Water polo has elements of many sports: the passing of basketball, the speed of hockey, the strategy of soccer, the pitching of baseball, the physicality of rugby or judo or wrestling. The women glide like dolphins and fight like grizzlies.“The first thing everyone needs to know about water polo,” Steffens says, “is that never once — not even in warm-up — do we touch the bottom of the pool. It is all our own power, our own strength.”At dinner in Los Angeles before the Olympics, Steffens asked Flav what his version of a gold medal was.“And right away he said: ‘Honestly my Olympics is every time I get to get on that stage,’” Steffens said. “I loved that, because that’s my mentality.”In Paris, Steffens and her teammates have been keeping rigorous training sessions and “grandma sleep schedules.” They play Monday, Wednesday and Friday this week.Flav, meanwhile, has been living his best life in the run-up to the Olympics: appearing on sunset terraces in Ibiza, hitting a Taylor Swift concert in Hamburg (“Flaavorrrr Flaaaav,” the singer mouthed to him from the stage), then arriving in Paris, where he gave Public Enemy swag to the U.S. ambassador to France after a tour of her residence. (Apparently there was synergy here, too, with Flav’s Instagram account reposting some State Department travel information for Americans headed to Paris).These past few days here, “Flaavorrrr Flaaaav” seems to be ringing out from passersby as regularly as bells from all the churches.“Another thing that I’m doing for the team … is after this water polo thing is over: putting ’em all on a Virgin cruise,” Flav said at a news conference here Friday — the only Team USA news conference on the schedule for a nonathlete. (Flav is not a spokesman for Virgin Voyages. He just loves the cruise line. But it’s all synergy. He got Virgin to give the team and staff an all-expenses-paid, seven-night cruise anywhere in the world, according to Ellis, who added this via text message: “Maybe more companies will step up now.”)On Saturday, at the women’s water polo match against Greece, first lady Jill Biden sat front and center while Flav was up in the nosebleeds. During the third quarter, reps for the team and the U.S. Olympic Committee arranged a meeting spot for Biden and Flav, who embraced in the stands, in full view of NBC. (Synergy, synergy, synergy.) The first lady praised Flav’s work with women’s sports.“They got three back-to-back gold medals,” Flav told Biden. “I’m just trying to cheer them on to get that number four.”After the match, which the U.S. team won 15 to 6, the first lady and her delegation met the players in the athlete’s lounge on the bottom floor of the Aquatics Center.“That was incredible,” Biden told the team, marveling at their prowess. “Most of us had never seen this before, so we were learning. I mean, I don’t know how you have the strength to do it!”“I don’t want to trade jobs,” Steffens replied with a laugh, implying that Biden’s job was much harder. “We all have our lanes.”But for this moment, in these Olympics, all lanes seem to be intersecting in the pool."
WaPo_61,"How to grill steak for the best flavor and texture, no matter the cut",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/29/how-to-grill-steak-indirect-heat/,2024-07-29 22:15:02.991095,,"Grilling, at first glance, can seem like an imprecise science: an open flame, a slab of meat and hope for the best.But given the prevalence of high-quality grills and the quality (and price) of the meat available to cook, there’s never been a better argument for learning the nuance of the method. That’s especially true when it comes to steak; beef prices hit record highs in 2023, and more increases could be coming.So if you’re going to splurge, it’s essential to learn the best approach to grilling — the keys to steak that’s melt-in-your-mouth tender, with a flavorful, crisp exterior.Before you head to the store to select your meat — and certainly before you fire up your grill — take a moment to brush up on the best cuts, the best methods and the myths that might be standing between you and your best steak.Whether you’re working with charcoal or a gas flame, you should make sure you brush off excess buildup on your grill’s grates — ideally after grilling, so you’re not dealing with it the next time you want to cook over an open flame.If you’re using a gas grill and need to clean before you cook, crank the heat up to high for 15 minutes with the lid closed, then turn off the gas and open the lid. A few passes with a grill brush or balled up aluminum foil between a pair of tongs should do the trick and get rid of any unwanted food particles and grease.If you’re using a charcoal grill, make sure to clean out the ash catcher and replenish the charcoal before you light it. Next, with all the air vents open, preheat the grill for about 15 minutes until it reaches a temperature of about 450 degrees, then use a grill brush or tongs and aluminum foil to clean.First up: the meat itself. No matter what flavors you’re planning for your seasoning or marinade, they’re going to involve salt, which can also have a tenderizing effect on steak and other proteins when applied in advance. So you might want to salt your steak a day in advance and let it rest in the fridge; in that case, less salt will go a longer way. Or, you can salt it just before you put it on the grill. In “The Food Lab,” chef and food writer J. Kenji López-Alt suggests salting meat more than 40 minutes or less than three minutes before cooking. Anything in between, he warns, will leave too much moisture on the surface and reduce the chances of getting the sear you’re seeking with a grilled steak.There are many great premade marinades and seasoning blends available, and you should feel free to get creative with the spices you have on hand. If you want to lean on a recipe, consider a marinade with brown sugar or red wine and herb-infused oil. Or go heavy on cracked pepper. Or try apricot preserves.And whether you marinate or season hours in advance or right before grilling, make sure you pat your steak dry right before it’s time to grill. That will keep steam from forming when the meat hits the hot grate and make for a better crust.Conventional wisdom dictates that a steak should sit at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes (or more), to slowly bring it closer to the temperature at which you’ll serve it and thus promote more even cooking.Steven Raichlen, a cookbook author, TV host and grilling expert, said he takes his steaks straight from the fridge to the grill. He worries about even the slim chance of encouraging bacterial growth, and he said it’s a myth that steaks need to rest at room temperature before cooking. (At Serious Eats, López-Alt performed an experiment that affirmed Raichlen’s approach: He left a steak on the counter in his 70-degree kitchen for 20 minutes, and the temperature at the center of his steak rose less than 2 degrees.)For belly cuts — these are thinner options, such as flank, skirt, flap and hanger — preheat your grill to between 450 and 550 degrees. The final cooking time will depend on several factors — the precise temperature of the grill, the thickness of the steak and your desired doneness — but for a medium-rare belly cut, aim for about 10 to 12 minutes. You can flip the meat once, after about five minutes, but Raichlen advises more frequent flipping. He said he’s recently started flipping steaks three, four or even five times to get a better crust without burning the meat.If you like the aesthetics of crosshatch grill marks, rotate your steak 90 degrees between flips. And make sure to keep the heat high and the grill top open throughout; there’s no need to worry about losing heat with these thinner cuts, since you’re relying on a high, direct flame to cook them. Plus, leaving the lid open allows you to flip the steaks more frequently and keep a close eye on how quickly they’re cooking.As for doneness: Use an instant-read thermometer, and always pull your steak off when it’s eight to 10 degrees cooler than your desired final temperature, regardless of the cut. (A medium-rare steak will register at 135 degrees, medium at 145 and medium-well at 150.) Don’t worry about piercing your meat with a thermometer or even a fork. It won’t cause your steak to dry out, Raichlen said.With belly cuts, there’s one caveat: Sometimes they’re thin enough that it’s hard to get an accurate temperature read from the center. In that case, try the finger test, which compares the firmness of the steak to the flesh beneath your thumb. Touch the tips of your middle finger and thumb of one hand together. With your other hand, press the flesh below where your thumb meets your palm. That’s how a medium-rare steak should feel.After your steak has rested for about 10 minutes, slice it, making sure to cut against the grain, which will make the meat easier to chew.Noble cuts, such as New York strip, rib-eye and T-bone, are typically more than an inch thick. They’re also often more expensive, Raichlen said, and “intrinsically tender,” and grilling them poses a unique challenge: It can be tricky to cook noble cuts to your desired internal temperature without burning the exterior.Instead of focusing on searing, your best bet is to turn your grill into a kind of convection oven and cook the steaks, to start, over indirect heat.Begin by heating your grill to between 250 and 300 degrees. Any warmer, and you’re at risk of overcooking. Place your steaks on the grill and close the lid, which will trap the hot air and cause it to circulate, helping the steak cook evenly. This will prevent you from winding up with a steak that’s undercooked in the center and burned on the exterior.Cook the steaks until they reach an internal temperature of 100 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. The time this takes will depend on the thickness of the meat, but it should be in the ballpark of 25 minutes. Next, take the steaks off the grill and let them rest for 10 minutes while you crank the grill’s heat up to high, between 450 and 550 degrees. Then slide the steaks back onto the grill and sear them, flipping at least once, until the outside is deep brown, with a blackened crust in spots, and the internal temperature lands where you’d like it for your preferred level of doneness. This should take about five to six minutes for a medium-rare steak.There’s another, opposite method that’s easy to try if you’re working on a gas grill with multiple burners: the “sear and slide” technique. (It’s possible to sear and slide on a charcoal grill, too, but the setup is a bit more complicated.) Start by setting one side of your grill to high heat and the other side to medium/low. Place your steaks on the hot side, searing them just like you would a belly cut, until they achieve the level of crust you desire. Aim for about one minute per side. At that point, check the internal temperature so you have a point of reference, then slide the steaks over to the medium/low side of the grill (at which point you can turn off the flame on the hot side). Cook them, flipping occasionally, until they’ve reached the internal temperature you’re looking for."

Colin L. Powell, the first Black national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state, died July 28 in Alexandria, Va. She was 86.Peggy Cifrino, former chief aide to Colin Powell, who died in 2021 at 84, confirmed the death but did not provide the cause.In a career mostly as a military spouse, Mrs. Powell also was a children’s book author and served on the board of America’s Promise Alliance, which focuses on civic engagement, education and workforce development.She married Powell, then a lieutenant in the Army, shortly before he left for his first deployment to Vietnam in 1962. Her husband rose to the rank of general, becoming the first Black national security adviser in 1987 and the youngest and first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1989.He retired from the military in 1993, was appointed secretary of state by President George W. Bush in 2001 and spent four often-beleaguered years in that job amid the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.The Powells moved more than 20 times during Colin Powell’s decades of active-duty service, and Mrs. Powell took a leading role helping other military families prepare for similar adjustments with their families. She was also a member of the Arlington Ladies, a group that attend funerals of service members at Arlington National Cemetery.After her husband reentered civilian life, Mrs. Powell began to focus her energies more on education issues and improving children’s lives.The couple were key to launching America’s Promise Alliance in 1997, and Mrs. Powell held several positions on its board, including her most recent post of chair emeritus. She also wrote two children’s books to support the mission of the organization, called “America’s Promise” and “My Little Red Wagon,” aimed at encouraging children to give back to their communities, according to publisher HarperCollins.From 1989 to 2000, she was chair of the National Council of the Best Friends Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of young girls.Mrs. Powell, who was appointed to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board during Bill Clinton’s presidency, was also picked to be on an advisory board for historically Black colleges and universities in 2010 by President Barack Obama. She sat on many other boards and won service awards.Alma Vivian Johnson, the oldest of two daughters, was born in Birmingham, Ala., on Oct. 27, 1937. Her father was the principal of one of Birmingham’s Black high schools, and her mother ran a day care, according to the obituary sent by Cifrino.In 1957 she received a bachelor’s degree in speech and drama at Fisk University, a historically Black college in Nashville. She returned to her hometown and briefly hosted an afternoon radio show that played music and discussed household tips.She soon relocated to Boston, where she studied pathology and audiology at Emerson College and worked for the Boston Guild for the Hard of Hearing by providing hearing tests, fitting veterans with hearing aids and teaching the deaf to read lips, according to the family obit. She was set up on a blind date with Colin Powell in 1961.They married the next year, at the First Congregational Church in her hometown, and she did not complete her graduate education.Survivors include three children, Michael, Linda and Annemarie, and several grandchildren. Michael Powell, a lobbyist, served as Federal Communications Commission chairman under President George W. Bush.Mrs. Powell supported her husband throughout his military career, but she was opposed to him running for president, The Post reported, and despite entreaties from leaders of both parties, he said he was unenthusiastic about campaigning for high office.The Post’s Bob Woodward asked the former general a few months before his death, “Who was the greatest man, woman or person you have ever known?""“It’s Alma Powell,” he said. “She was with me the whole time. We’ve been married 58 years. And she put up with a lot. She took care of the kids when I was, you know, running around. And she was always there for me and she’d tell me, ‘That’s not a good idea.’ She was usually right.”"

WaPo_65,Noah Lyles ‘feels amazing’ in Paris after a tough Tokyo. Will gold follow?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/noah-lyles-sprinter-paris-olympics/,2024-07-29 23:39:02.902718,,"PARIS — In his public unveiling at the Olympics he intends to dominate next week, Noah Lyles walked into a conference hall Monday morning and strode behind a dais alongside a handful of America’s best track and field athletes. “Where’s the intro music?” the world’s fastest man asked, flashing his trademark smile underneath a Team USA cap. When none played, Lyles provided his own.“Duh duhduhduh da-duh!” Lyles sang. “The champ is here!”Lyles is a champion many times over, except in the one place that matters most to the broader sporting universe. He arrived in Paris as both the world’s most dominant sprinter and, owing to timing and a tumultuous 2021, a man in search of his first Olympic gold.The hole in his resume has not stifled his bombast. For the Opening Ceremonies, Lyles painted the letters I-C-O-N on his fingernails. At Monday’s news conference, he explained how his Tokyo bronze medal had instilled a desire to make himself impervious to defeat even on off-days. The result, he said, is that an opponent will have to surpass their very best to beat him.“To be honest, when Noah Lyles is being Noah Lyles,” Lyles said, “there’s nobody.”That was true at the U.S. Olympic trials, where Lyles won both the 100 and 200 meters. It was true at the 2023 world championships, where Lyles claimed gold in the 100, 200 and 4X100 relay. Lyles aims to repeat his triple gold here, while taking aim at Usain Bolt’s 19.19-second world record in the 200 meters, an event in which Lyles has won 26 consecutive races.The stakes are clear. If he performs the way he has proven capable, he will etch himself in U.S. track and field history, with a chance to further burnish his legacy four years from now in Los Angeles. If he lands somewhere other than the top of a podium, he will face persistent questions about his ability to summon his best on the sport’s biggest stage.By talent and accomplishment, Lyles is already an undeniable all-time sprinter. He owns six world championship titles, three of them bagged in last summer’s monumental treble. Only two men — and no Americans — have run 200 meters faster. He is the 100 meters world champion and still improving, evidenced by his personal-best 9.81-second race at the London Diamond League meet earlier this month.By résumé, though, Lyles lacks the prize that allows him to rightfully claim the status stenciled on his fingernails, even as he enters the last Olympics of his 20s. He barely missed making the team at the 2016 U.S. trials as a precocious 18-year-old, then had to wait an extra year, until he turned 23, for his Olympic debut in Tokyo.The isolation of the pandemic and the anguish he felt after George Floyd’s murder made 2021 the most turbulent year of Lyle’s life. Typically effervescent, he openly discussed turning to antidepressant medication, which he stopped taking before the U.S. trials because he believed it affected his weight and training.Lyles didn’t make the 100-meter team and finished third in Tokyo at the 200, still his worst finish as a professional. The dearth of crowds sapped Lyles’s enthusiasm even as he approached the start line for introductions.“We’re all just standing behind our blocks,” Lyles said. “That’s usually the moment when in my head I’m like, ‘It’s showtime!’ And I just remember [thinking], ‘This is not it. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted. This is not what I thought it was going to be like.’ That’s literally the last few thoughts I had when I got into the blocks. And it sucked.”After the Tokyo 200 meters, Lyles bawled speaking with reporters, sharing his mental health battle in hopes he could help others. He also called his bronze medal “boring.”“I don’t feel different about it,” Lyles said at the U.S. trials last month. “I don’t like that thing. But I think by not liking it, it gives me the fire to keep going and keep pressing. Every time I turn around, I’ll be like, ‘Yeah, I think I’m doing enough. Then I turn around and look at the medal — ‘Alright, back to work.’ ”Lyles focused most of his work on the 100, a race he only recently came to dominate. He won silver at this year’s 60-meter indoor world championship, signaling to the track world that Lyles, previously known to start slowly, was getting faster out of the blocks.Lyles’s first days in Paris have not been all smooth, he said Monday. Lyles has always courted fame, but since Netflix released “Sprint,” the docuseries in which he stars, he has sometimes found more of it than he wants. Other athletes and volunteers have mobbed him in the Athletes Village. Lyles has spoken to his therapist about how he can protect his space, he said, and he even began eating meals at off-hours with his girlfriend, Jamaican 400-meter runner Junelle Bromfield, so he can seclude himself.Though other famous athletes stay away from the Village, Lyles said, “I don’t want to leave. But it’s definitely something I feel like after this Olympics I’m going to have to have conversations higher up than me in terms of making that more aware.”Lyles said he shared his frustration to draw U.S. Olympics officials’ attention, but also to be honest with himself about what’s troubling him. He lied to himself during his mental health struggle in 2021, he said. Now, he wants to let himself feel every emotion. There’s been plenty of gratitude. He’s barely taken off the hat he wore to the news conference, given to every American Olympian and stitched with the words “made it.”“I can finally say I’m showing up for an Olympic Games not depressed,” Lyles said. “It feels amazing. A lot of joy. I can always think back to the last Olympics and be like, ‘No, this one is not the same. This one is way better and I’m ready to show it.""Lyles’s path to three golds is far from clear. Despite his supremacy in the 200, American Kenny Bednarek, the reigning Olympic silver medalist, led Lyles after 100 meters at the U.S. trials and challenged him with a personal best 19.59 seconds. In the 100, 21-year-old Kishane Thompson won the Jamaican trials in 9.77 seconds, the fastest time this year — and faster than Lyles has ever run.Thompson’s performance led some observers to claim Lyles no longer deserved the title of world’s fastest man. He disagreed on social media, then reiterated his stance Monday: the crown belongs to either the reigning Olympic champion or the current world champion.“Which I am one of,” Lyles said, pausing briefly. “And soon to be another one of.”"

The officials said they plan to continue searching through the gunman’s phones and his gaming and social media accounts to identify a possible motive or any indication that he may have worked with an accomplice. They said he used at least some encrypted communication accounts.Agents have conducted more than 450 interviews, including with Crooks’s parents, who did not seem to have any indication of the attack before it occurred and have been cooperating with authorities, officials said.“We believe the suspect made significant efforts to conceal his activities,” Rojek said.Trump was speaking at an outdoor rally when Crooks, 20, opened fire from a rooftop just outside the security perimeter. The gunman fired at least eight shots, killing one person in the crowd, critically injuring two others and wounding Trump before being killed by a Secret Service sniper.The FBI said last week that a bullet or bullet fragment grazed the former president’s ear.Much of the investigation has focused on security failures that allowed a man with a rifle to obtain a perch from which to shoot at the president from about 150 yards away.

And in a stroke of logistical fortune for the U.S. Soccer Federation and fans wishing to see both play, each side was drawn into first-round groups initially based in the south of France.The teams were staying in hotels about four miles apart in this Mediterranean port city and shared the same training grounds in Martigues, a canal-graced town about 25 miles northwest of Marseille’s famous waterfront.Because of preplanned off-day schedules, players have not been able to attend each other’s matches. And on Sunday, the men relocated 190 miles north to Lyon ahead of their group finale Tuesday in Saint-Etienne against Guinea.Nonetheless, the American soccer synergy was alive and well in Provence.“We are rooting them on, and it’s just really exciting to be here alongside them,” Zimmerman said. “We both have aspirations to really go far in this tournament, and hopefully we’ll meet up again in Paris.”Should results go their way in the coming days, both will head to Paris for quarterfinals on Friday (men) and Saturday (women) at Parc des Princes, France’s most famous soccer venue.Second in Group A behind France, the U.S. men (1-1-0) would secure one of the quartet’s two quarterfinal berths with a victory. A draw would also probably suffice. Even a defeat might not prevent them from their first visit to the Olympic knockout stage in 24 years.Having already clinched a place in the quarterfinals, the women (2-0-0) will aim to win Group B on Wednesday in Marseille against Australia (1-1-0).“I have a great relationship with Walker and great respect for him as a person and player,” Horan said. “We text each other before every game, wishing each other good luck and good luck to the teams.”Horan continued, “It’s really special to have the men’s team at the Olympics because we haven’t had that in a while. To have both teams here in Marseille for a few days and be able to share this experience is one of the things that makes the Olympics unique.”The U.S. men played their first two matches at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, losing to France and defeating New Zealand, while the women traveled 120 miles east to Nice and defeated Zambia before returning to Marseille for a 4-1 rout of Germany on Sunday.Per tradition, Olympic soccer is played not only in the host city but throughout the host country. Lyon, Bordeaux and Nantes are also among the seven cities staging matches.The women’s players have been watching the men’s games in their meal room. The men say they have watched the women’s games in their hotel rooms or treatment room and caught highlight packages.“It’s great that they won [Sunday], and it’s obviously something we’re proud of,” center back Miles Robinson said. “We’re rooting for them.”Right back Emily Fox has taken a particular interest in Kevin Paredes’s performances, and vice versa. Both are from Northern Virginia.The women’s players are not as familiar individually with their male counterparts here as those on the men’s national team because this men’s competition is primarily for players 23 and under. (The women are allowed to field their full national team.)One exception to the men’s roster rule is Zimmerman, a 31-year-old center back who was among Coach Marko Mitrovic’s three over-aged selections.Two years ago, the 2022 World Cup starter was instrumental in forging collective bargaining agreements that provided pay equity for the women’s team, following years of labor acrimony with the USSF. The teams now pool and share tournament prize money.Missing the chance to attend Olympic women’s group matches has been a “bummer,” Zimmerman said. “I’ve been trying to link up with some of them, and it’s just so hard with the schedules and how quick the turnaround is” between matches.After the men’s 4-1 victory over New Zealand, Zimmerman half-jokingly credited the women, who’d scored three times in the first half against Zambia, for galvanizing his team’s fast start. “Being up at the half 3-0 was probably inspiration from the women’s team,” he said. “We saw they can do it; we wanted to join in on the fun.”"
WaPo_70,Merci for the memories: Roland Garros pays tribute to ‘Ra-fa! Ra-fa!’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/rafael-nadal-roland-garros-paris-olympics/,2024-07-30 00:36:02.956940,,"PARIS — No matter the occasion — the familial and familiar French Open, where he built his legend, or the once-in-a-lifetime Olympics on the clay he all but owned — it was hard to imagine Rafael Nadal being muscled and bullied out of Roland Garros. He had played 117 singles matches on these hallowed grounds. He had won 113 of them.They ought to build a statue of him at the entrance to this place. Oh, wait. They already have.But on Monday afternoon, in front of an adoring crowd that seemed, collectively, on the verge of tears, here was the 38-year-old Nadal, crumbling. The stakes weren’t what they normally are for the Spaniard at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Neither was Nadal’s form. Down 6-1, 4-0 to old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round of the Olympic men’s tennis tournament, the air hung heavy with sympathy, not celebration.“Playing against Novak without creating damage to him, and without having the legs of 20 years ago,” Nadal said, “it’s almost impossible now.”Djokovic is one of the few players in history who can claim to match or surpass Nadal’s accomplishments. He has 24 grand slam titles; Nadal, 22. They have met nine times in major finals. They shared the Olympic stage here. Unlike swimmers or sprinters, they don’t particularly need it and absolutely won’t be defined by it.The 37-year-old Serb isn’t nearly as beloved on these grounds as is Nadal, whose 14 French Open titles are a record. Nadal is from Spain. The French consider him their own, even in the decidedly jingoistic Olympics.“I always feel like [I’m] playing at home when I play here,” Nadal said. “It’s so special for me.”A measure of France’s appreciation for Nadal came in Friday’s Opening Ceremonies for the Paris Games, when, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, French soccer legend Zinedine Zidane passed the Olympic torch to Nadal. It could have seemed an acquiescence to a neighboring country. Instead, it read as a poignant invitation from a culture that regards itself as welcoming. The Games are open to all. We embrace others as our own.Monday, that warm respect was extended here. From the very first game, the stadium rang with chants of “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!”And then Djokovic began play. The gap between the two was exposed. It appeared enormous.“I was not able to put him in difficult positions,” Nadal said. The rout seemed on.The sight of Nadal all but breaking down — he couldn’t come close to Djokovic’s serve, and struggled to hold his own — served as a reminder that the Spaniard has played only sparingly the past two years, hampered by a rash of injuries that included surgery on his hip. Djokovic is still ranked second in the world behind only Nadal’s countryman and Olympic doubles partner here, Carlos Alcaraz. Nadal arrived in Paris not only having lost his first-round match in this year’s French Open, but ranked 161st.A lot of clichés play into the Olympic ethos — about competitive spirit, fair play, determination, togetherness. They are clichés only because they repeatedly appear genuinely at each Games. For every doping case that creates or further fosters cynicism, for every brazen cheating scandal — hello, Canadian soccer program and your practice-surveying drones — there are a thousand instances in which an athlete or a team fights when it might not seem worth the fight anymore.Nadal did not beat Djokovic on Monday. But he didn’t lay down, too. Physically, he isn’t what he once was. Mentally?“I just try my best every single time,” he said, “to enjoy a thing I have been enjoying for so much time.”What an Olympic mindset. When Nadal faced that 4-0 deficit in the second set, he seemed done. He was not. He finally got his first break point in the match’s 13th game. The roar matched the moment. Such achievements — putting himself in position to break an opponent’s serve — once were mundane. This is no longer “once.” Djokovic’s ensuing double fault was greeted with cheers and fist pumps. And when Nadal ended a spectacular rally with a forehand winner to break Djokovic again and pull even at 4-4, the French fans stood in appreciation. The artist could still put the brush to the canvas.Capture it with a picture. Who knows if this may be his last appearance here? Monday will be a footnote in Nadal’s career. Indeed, when Nadal finally grabbed momentum, Djokovic yanked it right back. He broke Nadal — putting his hand to his ear to mock all the partisans in the seats — then served out the match with a resounding ace that made him a 6-4, 6-4 winner.Nadal is still alive in the Olympic doubles tournament with Alcaraz, so any au revoir wasn’t in full Monday. Still, there was a feeling of finality. After he packed his bag and slung it on his shoulder, Nadal walked toward the center of the court, raised both hands to the crowd and waved. He turned and headed to the tunnel without soaking in much more.Fini?“You ask me for that every single day, you know?” Nadal said, not as much annoyed as stating the truth. “ … I cannot live every single day with the feeling that it’s going to be or not going to be my last match.”But if it’s not here, it’s coming. His first French Open title came in — get this — 2005. His most recent was two years ago.“Everything has a beginning,” he said. “Everything has an end. But you know, guys, I cannot complain. I achieved much more than what you ever dream. If that’s the last match here, or whenever it’s going to be the last match here, I accept in peace.”That would be easy even if he hadn’t pushed back against Djokovic on Monday. But he did. That matches who Nadal is, sure. But it matches what the Olympics are supposed to be about as well."
WaPo_71,A tropical storm could develop in Atlantic this week,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/29/tropical-atlantic-storms-debby/,2024-07-30 00:18:02.956940,,"After a quiet few weeks in the Atlantic, hurricane season may soon awaken again. A tropical weather disturbance approaching the Lesser Antilles — the island chain separating the eastern Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea — could be primed to gradually develop late this week, then pose a threat to the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the southeastern United States, including Florida, by the weekend or early next week.On Monday, the National Hurricane Center estimated that this disturbance has a 50 percent chance of eventual development into a tropical depression or storm. If it reaches storm intensity, “Debby” is the next name on 2024’s list of Atlantic storms.Computer models project the system may remain weak for the next four or five days, but some indicate it has the potential to organize quickly when it’s not far from the United States.This system may mark the beginning of a period of increased storminess in the Atlantic. Experts continue to warn that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be extremely active. In fact, researchers at Colorado State University estimate there will be 25 named storms, including the three that have formed so far.The season has already featured Beryl, which became the earliest-forming Category 5 hurricane on record before it struck Houston on July 8, buffeting the city with 80 to 90 mph winds and nearly a foot of rain.On Monday, the system was about 700 to 800 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and was slowly drifting west. It looked ragged and disheveled on satellite imagery, with only a few weak pulses of shower and thunderstorm activity.That’s because it was being knocked off-kilter by strong upper-level winds to the north of the system. Moreover, dry air at high altitudes was wrapping into the disturbance, eroding its structure and ability to sprout thunderstorms.In the short term, the system has very limited prospects to develop. Hostile winds and pockets of dry air will continue to impede it for the next three or four days. By late in the workweek, it will be meandering through the Bahamas or near the Dominican Republic and Haiti, perhaps approaching Cuba.By Friday and Saturday, high-altitude winds may relax enough to allow some strengthening. Moreover, upward-moving air will begin to spread over the western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.The rising air currents could help the system strengthen if it’s not weakened by potentially passing over land in the Dominican Republic, Haiti or Cuba.If the system survives long enough to make it into the Gulf of Mexico or the southwestern Atlantic, the risk of becoming a named storm or hurricane increases. However, some computer modeling suggests this system will not hold together and won’t present a significant threat that far west.The envelope of possibilities of where the system may end up is very large. The main influence on its path is the Bermuda high — a large semi-stationary high pressure system over the central Atlantic. Clockwise steering currents around this high will push the system westward and eventually more to the north. But exactly where and when this northward turn occurs is difficult to project this many days in advance.The system is unlikely to strengthen substantially before reaching Puerto Rico, so it looks like the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico probably won’t see major impacts. Cuba, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Florida and the Carolinas should keep close tabs.Aside from this system, there are no other areas of concern in the tropics. But the Atlantic could become much busier in mid-August. That’s when a cycling weather pattern known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation will support rising air over the tropical Atlantic."

WaPo_73,A surprising byproduct of wildfires: Contaminated drinking water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/wildfire-drinking-water-supply-danger/,2024-07-30 00:00:02.956940,,"Over the weekend, the Park Fire grew to more than 360,000 acres, prompting evacuation orders and warnings around Chico, California in Butte, Plumas, Shasta and Tehama counties. In the days ahead, Cal Fire will seek to contain the blaze to reduce harm to people, structures and the environment. However, months from now when the rains come and the fires are extinguished, a hidden threat could put communities at risk once again.
When the mayor of Las Vegas, N.M., issued a warning in 2022 to its 13,000 residents, it wasn’t over a fire — they had recently lived through the state’s largest wildfire in its history: Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak. The dire warning was that the city had 30 days of clean water left. The 2022 monsoon rains covered the Gallinas watershed, where cleared trees from the Santa Fe National Forest and ash-covered grounds made for flash-flood conditions. The storms introduced massive amounts of carbon from burned trees and plant life into the streams and reservoirs. Water treatment couldn’t keep up, making their stores undrinkable.
Around 60 to 65 percent of the United States’ drinking water comes from forested areas. As fires burn in these areas, they increase the risk of cancer-causing and toxic substances entering water supplies. An estimated 53.3 million U.S. residents who live in areas with significant wildfire risk may face damaged drinking water infrastructure from those flames.

Randy Dahlgren, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Davis whose research focused on wildfires and watersheds in California, says that fires’ impact on clean water boils down to the size, intensity and severity of the fire.
The 2022 Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak wildfire is among the largest in recorded history in the United States. The fire perimeter stretched across 340,000 acres, with high burn severity in most areas. Thousands were forced to evacuate during the course of the months-long blaze. These megafires — fires greater than 100,000 acres — of the 21st century are increasingly common due in large part to the persistently drier and hotter conditions of forested areas in a warming climate.
“I would project that both the size and the severity of wildfires are going to increase,” says Dahlgren. Post-megafire fallout — because of their scale and intensity — is linked to poorer water quality during the following rainy seasons, Dahlgren adds.
Megafires burn land at higher temperatures across wider areas than standard wildfires, putting watersheds across the United States at greater risk. Sheila Murphy, a research hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey working on the effects of wildfires on water quality, says burned areas fundamentally alter a watershed’s hydrology. As wildfires burn hotter and consume more trees and structures, water quality will continue to worsen, research suggests.
When watersheds burn, the threat starts in the forests, continues to water treatment plants, and can expand to communities and households. To meet these risks, it will take a coalition of informed community members, scientists and city officials to work toward solutions to protect clean water supplies.

The healthy forest
A normal watershed includes land with healthy vegetation and ground cover that help control and protect the water table and groundwater. Typical in the West, legacy mines were revegetated to keep harmful tailings from going downstream.
When it rains, a ground cover of leaves, grass and dirt filters a large portion of the water before it soaks into the ground.
In the wake of a wildfire, ash from burned vegetation replaces the ground cover.
As a hydrophobic material, the ash inhibits the ground from absorbing rain water and replenishing the groundwater. Unable to soak into the ground, the water accumulates, increasing the likelihood of landslides and flash flooding.
Legacy mining waste, previously covered and sealed by revegetation, can be exposed. It can flow with runoff into waterways, elevating levels of harmful chemicals and metals such as arsenic and lead.
Community risks
Valley communities near reservoirs, such as the town of Ledoux, N.M., are at risk of flooding after wildfires.
After a heavy rainfall, the excessive runoff, combined with ash, debris and sediment, can cause a reservoir to overflow — flooding areas below it.
Even if the reservoir doesn’t overflow, the buildup of dissolved organic matter (DOM) lowers the reservoir’s storage capacity and can lead to poorer water quality.
Nutrients from DOM increase the likelihood of toxic algae blooms that remove oxygen from the water, triggering organism die-offs.
Once oxygen is gone, it can cause heavy metals, like mercury from old mines, to convert to methylmercury. This compound is toxic to wildlife and may cause developmental problems in fetuses and children.

Treatment of this water involves chlorination or expensive coagulants. Chlorination has a hard ceiling on removing DOM from water, as disinfectant byproducts like chloroform damage human chromosomes and living cells and increase the risk of cancer and birth defects.
Risks at home
When fires burn too closely to communities, entire water systems, including their piping, can be compromised.
This happens when high ambient heat unfurls plastic polymers in PVC water lines. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the damaged pipes mix with the water inside.
As homes burn, firefighters tap into the water supply to put out flames. The draw on the system can create a vacuum which can pull VOCs into the city’s water mains, shared with other homes.
After the fires are out and homes are rebuilt, it can be hard to locate the damaged pipe releasing VOCs into the system. If the contamination is between the city water main and the homes, there’s no way to know without testing every household.
Scientists are only beginning to study the effects megafires pose on local ecology.
Newsha Ajami, the chief strategic development officer for research in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Area at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, studies the multifaceted ways fires impact forest management, water utilities and communities. Ajami says on the state of the science, “We’re destabilizing [water] systems and we don’t even know in what way and how.”
In 2019, a team of enterprising hydrologist-planners realized that there needs to be a handbook for this new reality of wildfire impacts on communities. That fall, volunteers from more than a dozen municipalities wrote the Post-Fire Recovery Playbook, a first-of-its-kind 12-page concise document for water municipalities, land and forest management, and governments to rebuild within 30 days of a fire.
Ecologists and researchers working with post-fire effects on water juggle hyperlocal environmental needs with the needs of neighboring communities and the resources of their governments. The authors of the recovery playbook found that measures need to be in place for communities of any size to handle the aftermath of nearby fires. The guide highlights the “gap in guidance in terms of navigating the complexities surrounding post-fire rehabilitation.”
Ajami sees a critical role for insurance companies implementing smart, resilient practices for communities left to cinders. Similar to how health insurance is trying to focus on preventive care to reduce the cost of treating disease, Ajami hopes “at some point we will have a preventive insurance model that would invest in actions people can take from being impacted.”
“That’s something we’re starting to touch on now in terms of research,” says Andrew Whelton, a professor at Purdue University working in civil, environmental and ecological engineering. Whelton says that “the insurance industry needs to understand water contamination, water safety, what the alternatives are and how much they cost.” The demands are in understanding costs so they can effectively get ahead of these disasters. “Simply put, insurance companies haven’t anticipated these costs and they haven’t anticipated the cost at the scale they are being hit at.”
When the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fire climbed the side of a mountain into a housing development in Boulder Creek, Calif., toxic contamination didn’t spread from the homes back into the water system. That was because the San Lorenzo Valley district utility made sure the valves in that network prevented backflow. Preventive steps like that, Whelton says, go a long way in improving fire resiliency and keeping community drinking water safe. He would know, too: Whelton has become the go-to expert flying out to nearly every megafire that’s burned down towns since 2017, working with communities and municipalities on testing water.
Another prevention area is setting up proper lines of communication. Three days after the Maui fires and evacuations began in 2023, the Maui County Department of Water Supply issued an “Unsafe Water Advisory.” All Maui households surveyed in a recent study by Whelton and several other researchers “expressed concerns or confusion about drinking water safety” two weeks after the fire.
Communication challenges, like rapidly getting information to water customers after a fire, are what led Whelton and his colleagues to co-author the Wildfire Response Guide for Environmental Public Health Professionals for the National Environmental Health Association. Guides that reduce friction between local and state governments and health professionals assist in risk-monitoring communities post-fire. For protecting water, the guide explicitly highlights where water can be compromised, offering damage-assessment guidance, community messaging on safety risks, and what kinds of testing to prioritize.
Further downstream, researchers contend with how to build homes in fire-prone areas to make them more resilient and leach less hazardous waste in the event of a disaster.
Erica Fischer, a civil engineer at Oregon State University who spent her PhD studying fire impacts on buildings, saw firsthand the devastation wrought by wildfires in communities like Paradise, Calif., and Louisville, Colo. She’s witnessed conversations move away from just forest management to home-hardening and resiliency-building. Legislation like Oregon’s Senate Bill 762 — which put $220 million into wildfire preparedness of buildings, landscapes and emergency response — Fischer notes, not only puts resources into mapping wildfire risk after the 2020 Oregon fires, but also provides financial assistance for the socially vulnerable in the rural communities at risk.
Other legislation is also being advanced. The EMBER act, a bipartisan bill introduced in June by Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), aims to modernize national wildfire policies, including by updating recovery guidance on drinking water toxicity resulting from wildfires.
With practices like this in place across wildfire risk areas, the likelihood of a watershed weathering subsequent high rains improves. Dahlgren hits on the adage: “Dilution is the solution to pollution.” If there are backups in place, diluting at least the DOM water can provide safe drinking water downstream.
Meanwhile in Boulder, Colo., they are divining the future of fires. Kate Dunlap, a Post-Fire Recovery Playbook co-author and manager of Boulder’s Drinking Water Quality program, applies machine-learning algorithms to identify where to place resources for disaster preparedness. One model simulated 10,000 burns in the watershed according to local topography, vegetation and geology. The results allow Dunlap’s team to understand how much risk there is, where disasters can come from and how much it’ll cost to prevent or treat them.
These forecasts help cities predict how much sediment could enter reservoirs. Knowing where hazardous debris might come from allows the government to prioritize stabilizing at-risk forested areas while keeping costs low.
The science is trying to keep pace with an ever longer and more frequent fire season. Researchers consulted for this story are studying fires from 2021 and 2022, as well as conditions generated by these newer, larger fires that burn in regions geographically, vegetation-wise and community-wise different from where previous fires burned. Additional research is critical to understand how this global risk impacts communities at a local level.
Dunlap sees a lot more urgency here in her field. In eight years on the job, it’s only since 2020 that she’s witnessed increased funding sources at the state and federal level for forest health projects. The general awareness shift she’s seen is that “wildfires are real and we’re not really experiencing these sort of natural fires anymore. They’re very severe.”
The community of Las Vegas, N.M., is preparing for the next big fire by strengthening their water supplies along the Gallinas River, both upstream by the wildfire-prone regions and downstream at the household level. Johanna Blake, a U.S. Geological Survey researcher at the New Mexico Water Science Center, sent The Washington Post photos of the rocky barriers — gabions — that now stretch along the river bed. After the rainy season in 2022, she could smell the collected ash that got stopped before entering the river there.
About the story
The wildfire risk to watersheds were calculated from the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest to Faucet data. A watershed was categorized as “Great risk” if 70% or more of its total acres had a “high or very high wildfire hazard potential.”
The number of surface drinking water consumers for each watershed is based on late 2018/early 2019 population estimates.
Only watersheds that were entirely contained within state boundaries were included in the calculation of residents at risk of wildfire water contamination in Washington and California. Watersheds that intersected with state lines were not included in the calculation to avoid double counting.

WaPo_74,Flash flood at Dollywood pushes Parton fans to flee in high water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/29/dollywood-flood-video/,2024-07-30 01:56:02.570163,,"Dollywood fans enjoying a summer weekend had to flee the Tennessee theme park Sunday after strong storms sent floodwaters rushing through the park, forcing some to wade through nearly waist-deep water to get to their cars.Photos and videos captured on social media showed brown water surging through pedestrian areas and building up in the parking lot.“Craziest Dollywood experience in my almost 32 years of going,” one person wrote in a TikTok video that showed torrential rains and crowds in ponchos exiting the park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.The resort, which is co-owned by country music superstar Dolly Parton, was set to reopen at noon on Monday after visitors were forced out by the rushing waters Sunday. Two rides that need additional cleanup will be delayed, the Tennessean reported.In a statement on social media, Dollywood wrote that one minor injury had been reported amid the thunderstorm and flash flooding. Fire and police workers from the Pigeon Forge helped “direct guests to safety during the storm,” the statement said.The flooding came as slow-moving thunderstorms passed over the area Sunday evening. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 5:39 p.m. that remained in effect until 10:45 p.m. The Weather Service said up to 4 to 5 inches of rain caused “multiple road closures, washouts, and even mudslides” in the area.The forecast calls for the possibility of repeated showers and storms between Monday night and Tuesday night that could bring damaging winds in addition to more flooding. Some areas could see an additional 3 inches or more rainfall, the Weather Service said.Please see this park update for Sunday, July 28, and Monday, July 29.Bryan McCarter, vice mayor of Sevier County, wrote on his Facebook page Sunday night that “significant flooding” was occurring in parts of the county. He wrote that several roads — including one near Dollywood — were closed due to water or washout.Several people wrote in social media accounts that they were not able to leave the parking lot due to the floods.“Didn’t have being stranded in the @Dollywood parking lot due to major flooding on my 2024 bingo card,” one person wrote on X with a video of cars driving onto flooded streets as rain continued pouring.“Dollywood is supporting guests whose vehicles were affected by this weather event,” the park’s statement said.The theme park is eight miles north of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 35 miles southeast of Knoxville, Tenn."
WaPo_75,"For Ukrainian diver, 10 meters from water, 1,500 miles from father at war",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/oleksii-sereda-ukraine-diver-paris-olympics/,2024-07-30 01:41:02.570163,,"PARIS — A voice has resonated through these Olympic early days even though it comes from a speaker so unwrinkled and doe-eyed he might make an observer think of Bambi. When it coursed through a conference hall from a microphone last Friday and near a pretty indoor pool from up close Monday, it brought brutal words through unassuming and understated means. If a distant invasion can remain an abstraction no matter how evil, maybe a listener can need a voice to feel a hint of the full horrible.Somehow, when the Ukrainian National Olympic Committee brought five athletes and one president to the Main Press Center last Friday, it was the wisp of a guy on the right end of the dais, born on Christmas Day 2005, who ushered the mind all the way to the reality and the heart all the way to the woodshed. For a long while of the hour, he barely spoke.One might have wondered if this diver, Oleksii Sereda, would speak at all as he sat quietly while words rang from older compatriots such as tennis star Elina Svitolina, that exemplary spokeswoman for the 36 million Ukrainians, or Olga Kharlan, the fencer disqualified from the 2023 world championships because she refused to shake the hand of the Russian opponent she had defeated.There Sereda sat, while committee president Vadym Guttsait made statements such as, “For us, there is no peace festival,” and, “I will never wish anyone to feel how does it feel like to be in Ukraine right now,” and, “For us, the Russian athletes [15 competing as neutral after their country’s banishment] do not exist. We don’t greet them. We don’t say hello. We don’t even look at them.”Finally, minutes from the end, Sereda got a question and used a voice not even close to blaring to tell of a blaring kind of human stress.“So for me it’s the second Olympic Games,” the 18-year-old said. “I was thinking that the first one [when he was 15] was gonna be harder, but as I see now, the second is gonna be much harder.”He arrived as no one’s arriviste. He had become the youngest 10-meter European champion in 2019 at 13 years, seven months, besting that famed old megastar Tom Daley from Plymouth, England, who had been 13 years, 10 months (and nowadays 30). Sereda finished sixth in both individual and synchronized disciplines at the Tokyo Olympics.But here came the first Olympics since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the first since Sereda’s sleep began suffering not only for air sirens, bombs and blinking electricity, but also for relentless worry over his 53-year-old father, Viktor, called to the military efforts to save a country around their hometown Mykolaiv, the Black Sea city of 29 months of horror and exodus where lately the bombs reached hospitals and playgrounds.Atop the merciless precision of an unforgiving sport, tack that.“It’s always stressful,” Sereda told the room, “because for example, I want to call him and he [can’t] take the call. I can’t talk to him, because he’s always busy.”He said, “It makes competition more stressful.”A certain quiet seemed to fill the large room, and soon Sereda explained more about his father. He said, “Before the war, was business, made furniture.” And he said, “Right now, he’s a soldier, right now.” And so: “It all changed for him, for me, for all of us. He has to do this. No words. That’s it.”Monday morning at the Aquatics Center near the Stade de France, this angelic-looking sort had to take all of that bulldozing going through his mind and go try to win a medal with partner Kirill Boliukh, age 17. With such hopes in whatever part of his mind remained clear for them, they started off in seventh after the first of six rounds, inched to sixth after the third, and inched to fifth after the fourth. All the while, Sereda and Boliukh would wait on the tall stairs before dives, bouncing and stretching, or in the hot tub afterward, recovering, while Sereda’s mind went sometimes to his father.“Yeah, of course, yeah,” he said later. “I’m always nervous about him because I don’t know what can happen there, because Mykolaiv, it’s a closed military zone, and so always rockets are flying there, bombs and stuff like that. So for me it’s like a casual, basic sense that I’m nervous about my father, about my family.”While the boisterous cheers in the building went for fourth-place Mexico (of Kevin Berlin Reyes and Randal Willars Valdez), bronze medalist Canada (of Rylan Wiens and Nathan Zsombor-Murray), silver medalist Great Britain (of Daley and Noah Williams), and the unbeatable gold medalist China (of Junjie Lian and Hao Yang), Ukraine reached the fifth round, with the high degree of difficulty of 4½ forward somersaults, and that’s where Sereda would lament he erred as Ukraine ended in fifth, a mere six points behind Mexico and just fewer than 10 behind Canada and bronze.With the voice somewhere between calm and bummed, he lamented as he and Boliukh stopped in a room separate from the pool at the mixed zone, the traditional Olympic area where athletes meet reporters. As about eight Ukrainian journalists asked about five minutes of questions in Ukrainian, none concerned the invasion. People who know it in their bones don’t require insight on how it feels.Now and then, they laughed.“Has Kirill chastised you?” went one question, in Ukrainian and jest.“Kirill chastises me,” Sereda said. “And he hits me in my hotel room.”“Only every other day,” Boliukh offered.Otherwise, the scrum brought traditional Olympic strains. It had the time-honored question about the judging, to which Sereda said, “I don’t feel like they lowballed me. It’s my own fault,” and soon explained, “If I’d done the jump correctly for 17 points then we would’ve been in third place. So yeah, no, I mean, yeah, we would’ve been. But you see, that’s the sport, you make one mistake and you’re kicked out” of contention.Only in the subsequent English portion of the session did the awful come up.“For me it was hard just to prepare,” said Sereda, based in Kyiv, the capital and largest city, about 250 miles from Mykolaiv. “We had a lot of troubles during our preparation for this competition. We had no light. We always needed to go somewhere in the same place, hide, even at night during our sleeping when we had to recover and relax, we hear alarm, and go to the safe place.”His sleep breaks even in Paris, he said, “because of the worry.”And with soldiers often following Ukrainian athletes in search of inspiration and even greater pride, Sereda said, “When you’re standing on the 10 meters, you’re, like, responsible for yourself, you’re responsible for your partner, your country, people who help us, people who defend our country. So we’re thinking we just had to get a medal, but we didn’t make it, so” — pause — “yeah, this is sad for us.”The voice stayed even-keeled, even when asked to address fellow citizens: “Guys, keep going. Never give up. Everything will be fine.”Soon Sereda and Boliukh, neither on the list for the 10-meter individual, headed down the hall and through the doors, a voice of the 2024 Olympics leaving the Olympics while striving to come back for “the next one” and then “the next one afterward.”Anastacia Galouchka in Kyiv contributed to this report."
WaPo_76,"Kamala Harris’s image bump, by the numbers",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/kamala-harriss-image-bump-by-numbers/,2024-07-30 01:28:02.570163,,"The early signs last week were that Vice President Harris’s replacement of President Biden as the Democrats’ 2024 standard-bearer appeared to modestly increase Democrats’ hopes of winning.The evidence since then has only affirmed that. The signs continue to improve for the Democratic ticket — particularly when it comes to Harris’s image.A long-unpopular vice president has gotten a second look from voters now that the spotlight is trained on her. And at least for now, the polls suggest that Americans are both warming to her and liking her significantly more than they like Biden.Multiple polls in recent days tell that tale.An ABC News/Ipsos poll Sunday showed Harris’s favorable rating at 43 percent. That’s eight points higher than her rating last month, and 11 points higher than Biden’s last month.A Wall Street Journal poll Friday showed 46 percent of registered voters liked Harris — 11 points higher than her showing just a month ago, and 12 points higher than Biden’s.And Fox News polls Friday in four key Midwestern and Rust Belt states — Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — showed Harris’s favorable rating averaging 49 percent, which is eight points higher than Biden’s current number.Combine that with earlier CNN and New York Times/Siena College polling, and it all suggests that Harris has increased favorable views of the top of the Democratic ticket by at least the high single digits.Some of the more interesting findings from those polls:Perhaps most striking in the Times/Siena poll is how much Harris appears to have made the Democratic ticket more palatable to less-reliable voters who could defect from the Democrats or sit out the 2024 election.While just 74 percent of Biden 2020 voters liked him, 88 percent of Biden 2020 voters liked Harris. And the poll showed her being viewed favorably by about twice as many people who didn’t vote in 2020 (46 percent vs. 24 percent) and who currently support a candidate besides her, Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (33 percent vs. 17 percent).All of which suggests Harris could not only stem the bleeding of Biden’s support, but she could appeal to less-likely voters and claw back some voters who went for left-leaning third-party candidates.As with all early polling conducted in the days after the Democrats’ switcheroo, it’s worth emphasizing that it’s early. Harris is surely in a honeymoon period that might not last, particularly as attention turns to some of the positions she took during her 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign.It’s also important to note that, even with the improved image of the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris’s favorable numbers are mostly similar to Trump’s in these polls. Trump appears to have gotten a bit of his own bump after the assassination attempt against him and the Republican National Convention, and he was already generally more popular than he was during his presidency. And the race both nationally and in swing states is very close.But there’s little question that, at least for now, Harris has put the Democratic ticket back on the map for lots of the most problematic voting groups for Democrats. Democrats looked like they were going to have to win lots of voters who didn’t like Biden and who didn’t seem to have much reason to vote blue, beyond dislike of Trump. Many of those voters today see a more viable option in Harris."
WaPo_77,"This time, the USWNT has company at the Olympics: The U.S. men",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/usa-men-women-soccer-olympics-france/,2024-07-30 01:00:02.570163,,"MARSEILLE, France — Before each of their respective Olympic soccer matches, U.S. women’s team captain Lindsey Horan and Walker Zimmerman, the elder statesman on a young men’s squad, exchange text messages wishing one another luck.For the first time since 2008, the men’s team joined the perennial women’s team in the tournament. And in a stroke of logistical fortune for the U.S. Soccer Federation and fans wishing to see both play, each side was drawn into first-round groups initially based in the south of France.The teams were staying in hotels about four miles apart in this Mediterranean port city and shared the same training grounds in Martigues, a canal-graced town about 25 miles northwest of Marseille’s famous waterfront.Because of preplanned off-day schedules, players have not been able to attend each other’s matches. And on Sunday, the men relocated 190 miles north to Lyon ahead of their group finale Tuesday in Saint-Etienne against Guinea.Nonetheless, the American soccer synergy was alive and well in Provence.“We are rooting them on, and it’s just really exciting to be here alongside them,” Zimmerman said. “We both have aspirations to really go far in this tournament, and hopefully we’ll meet up again in Paris.”Should results go their way in the coming days, both will head to Paris for quarterfinals on Friday (men) and Saturday (women) at Parc des Princes, France’s most famous soccer venue.Second in Group A behind France, the U.S. men (1-1-0) would secure one of the quartet’s two quarterfinal berths with a victory. A draw would also probably suffice. Even a defeat might not prevent them from their first visit to the Olympic knockout stage in 24 years.Having already clinched a place in the quarterfinals, the women (2-0-0) will aim to win Group B on Wednesday in Marseille against Australia (1-1-0).“I have a great relationship with Walker and great respect for him as a person and player,” Horan said. “We text each other before every game, wishing each other good luck and good luck to the teams.”Horan continued, “It’s really special to have the men’s team at the Olympics because we haven’t had that in a while. To have both teams here in Marseille for a few days and be able to share this experience is one of the things that makes the Olympics unique.”The U.S. men played their first two matches at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, losing to France and defeating New Zealand, while the women traveled 120 miles east to Nice and defeated Zambia before returning to Marseille for a 4-1 rout of Germany on Sunday.Per tradition, Olympic soccer is played not only in the host city but throughout the host country. Lyon, Bordeaux and Nantes are also among the seven cities staging matches.The women’s players have been watching the men’s games in their meal room. The men say they have watched the women’s games in their hotel rooms or treatment room and caught highlight packages.“It’s great that they won [Sunday], and it’s obviously something we’re proud of,” center back Miles Robinson said. “We’re rooting for them.”Right back Emily Fox has taken a particular interest in Kevin Paredes’s performances, and vice versa. Both are from Northern Virginia.The women’s players are not as familiar individually with their male counterparts here as those on the men’s national team because this men’s competition is primarily for players 23 and under. (The women are allowed to field their full national team.)One exception to the men’s roster rule is Zimmerman, a 31-year-old center back who was among Coach Marko Mitrovic’s three over-aged selections.Two years ago, the 2022 World Cup starter was instrumental in forging collective bargaining agreements that provided pay equity for the women’s team, following years of labor acrimony with the USSF. The teams now pool and share tournament prize money.Missing the chance to attend Olympic women’s group matches has been a “bummer,” Zimmerman said. “I’ve been trying to link up with some of them, and it’s just so hard with the schedules and how quick the turnaround is” between matches.After the men’s 4-1 victory over New Zealand, Zimmerman half-jokingly credited the women, who’d scored three times in the first half against Zambia, for galvanizing his team’s fast start.“Being up at the half 3-0 was probably inspiration from the women’s team,” he said. “We saw they can do it; we wanted to join in on the fun.”"

WaPo_79,Northern lights could reach unusually south early this week. How to see them.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/29/northern-lights-aurora-us-forecast/,2024-07-30 03:00:02.661985,,"Since the weekend, the sun has unleashed multiple waves of plasma that are set to bombard the Earth’s atmosphere and potentially bring colorful displays of the northern and southern lights.The lights, or auroras, may be visible Monday and Tuesday nights, especially in the high latitudes. It’s possible that some of the displays reach into the mid-latitudes — as far south as Oregon and the lower Midwest, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The potential for the aurora activity comes as the sun is near the peak of an 11-year cycle and these plasma eruptions occur with greatest frequency. The eruptions, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), originate from sunspot regions that tend to be particularly active around this solar maximum.A boisterous sunspot region is pointed at the Earth and began releasing CMEs over the weekend. According to SpaceWeather.com, some of them merged, forming a “cannibal CME,” which could produce a strong geomagnetic storm when it arrives at Earth. Geomagnetic storms are what cause aurora.Geomagnetic storms are rated 1 to 5 on the G-scale (G stands for geomagnetic), with 5 being the most intense. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is predicting conditions ranging between G1 and G3 through early Wednesday.A G3 storm often produces aurora as far south as the northern half of the United States. Such storms can also have minor effects on power systems and disrupt satellite and low-frequency radio navigation.G1-G3 Watches are out for 29-31 July due to a number of possible CME arrivals. Solar activity increased over the weekend and the Sun has been erupting in solar flares up to include an X1 flare (R3-Strong) on Sunday evening. Visit https://t.co/9VAtkQeOwM... for the full story. pic.twitter.com/3VNJJ9CRgMIn May, a G5 storm hit the Earth, producing aurora as far south as the tropics. By many accounts, it was most widespread display in at least two decades.High-latitudes locations such as Alaska, Canada and northern Europe have the best chance to see auroras Monday and Tuesday nights.Late Monday and toward Tuesday morning, when the geomagnetic storm may be strongest, the lights could extend south toward the mid-latitudes.If the storm materializes as predicted, the lights may be visible into the Midwest, New England and the Pacific Northwest. Spots even farther south, including California, the southern Plains and the Mid-Atlantic, could see a faint glow on the horizon, especially with the aid of long-exposure photography.However, because forecasting the arrival of CMEs is difficult, the timing of the most intense storm activity could shift.To follow the intensity of geomagnetic storm activity, consider monitoring the K-index. If and when this index reaches 7 or higher, that’s when aurora in the mid-latitudes are most probable.The aurora forecast for tonight (7/29-7/30) calls for KP7/G3 conditions! Pending favorable data, aurora may be visible overhead in New England and the Midwest - and on the horizon as far south as North Carolina and Oklahoma. pic.twitter.com/5rvix7O5B3Best viewing will be where skies are clear and away from city lights. Clouds are most likely to interfere with viewing in the Eastern United States and Pacific Northwest on Monday and Tuesday nights. However, even where clouds are forecast, it’s worth taking a peak outside, as there are sometimes unexpected breaks in the cloud canopy.Because the moon is in its last quarter phase, it will illuminate significantly less than when it was full about 10 days ago.The chance to see aurora could extend beyond Tuesday night.Because a large sunspot region is facing Earth, there is the chance for more CMEs this week.“The active region is now directly facing our planet and in a great position for Earth directed eruptions,” SolarHam.com, an online resource for space weather and aurora, wrote on X."
WaPo_80,"Paris, Olympic athletes brace for extreme heat Tuesday",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/29/paris-olympics-extreme-heat-weather/,2024-07-30 03:00:02.661985,,"Paris and much of France is experiencing a quick strike of high heat and humidity that began Monday in some places, posing challenges for athletes and spectators.The heat could last until Wednesday or Thursday, with temperatures rising well into the 90s (30s Celsius) in some places. Factoring in the humidity, heat indexes could reach near 105 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) in parts of southern France.Meteo-France, the national weather service, issued a yellow alert for Paris and most of central France, which indicates a one- to two-day period of heat that could be dangerous for vulnerable populations and those working outside or engaged in physical activity. Parts of southern France are under an orange alert, issued for intense and dangerous heat expected to last three days.The heat was already being felt Monday by tennis players on the clay courts of Roland Garros, while other sports braced for impacts Tuesday.“The athletes who undertook heat adaptations will be well prepared, but it’s still a challenge. Also, it looks to be a bit humid, which is much more difficult to compete in,” said Geoff Burns, an exercise physiologist with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “Triathlon is one sport, especially the men’s on Tuesday, that might see some of the effects on the run leg. You might not see ice vests in the morning, but on outdoor athletes in the afternoon, I would definitely expect to see them, as well as ice on the neck and maybe head.”Paris is forecast to reach the mid-90s (mid-30s Celsius) on Tuesday, with heat indexes reaching the upper 90s to low 100s (mid- to upper 30s Celsius). The most intense heat is expected in central and southern France, where heat indexes could climb to 100 to 105 (37 to 41 Celsius) in some cities hosting Olympic soccer matches Tuesday. To combat the heat, officials are distributing water bottles from a supply of more than 2.5 million that were ordered in anticipation of potentially dangerous heat during the Games.Nighttime temperatures will remain elevated, hovering near or above 70 degrees (21 Celsius) in many locations, making it hard to cool off. A lack of air conditioning in the Athletes’ Village led the United States and several other countries to bring portable air-conditioning units to ensure a comfortable sleeping environment for their athletes.Meteo-France published a summary of temperatures expected in some Olympic cities, with highs reaching the mid- to upper 90s (34 to 38 Celsius) in many cities hosting events, including Paris. In Nice, nighttime lows are forecast to stay above 77 degrees (25 Celsius).Soccer matches are scheduled to take place in some of the cities in central and southern France expecting the most intense heat:By Wednesday, highs in Paris should cool to the low 90s (low 30s Celsius), then into the 80s (mid-20s to near 30 Celsius) Thursday through the weekend. But after periods of rain dampened the Opening Ceremonies on Friday, occasional downpours are forecast around Paris from Tuesday through Thursday.The potential for a heat wave during the Paris Olympics, being held during what are typically the city’s hottest weeks of the year, has drawn much attention from both scientists and athletes. The average temperature in Paris during late July and early August has warmed by more than five degrees since 1924, the last time Paris hosted the Olympics, according to a report published last month. In that time, the nonprofit Climate Central says that “scorching days” with highs of 86 or higher have become nearly three times more frequent in Paris.France has experienced many deadly heat waves in recent years, including heat waves that led to more than 5,000 deaths in 2023 and more than 2,800 deaths in 2022. France’s most deadly heat wave killed nearly 15,000 people in August 2003. Researchers have found that human-caused climate change is making heat waves in Europe and other parts of the world hotter than they otherwise would have been.Gretchen Reynolds contributed to this report."

WaPo_82,Jack Yonezuka got the Olympic judo moment the 1980 boycott took from his father,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/jack-yonezuka-nick-olympic-judo-paris/,2024-07-30 02:51:02.661985,,"PARIS — Forty-four years later, Nick Yonezuka finally made it to the Olympics. He’s older now, probably appreciates the experience more than he would’ve way back then. He found his mind wandering as he walked through the Olympic Village these past few days, milling among athletes from around the world, all the best at their chosen craft.“I did think, like, this is what it would’ve been like,” said Yonezuka, 60.There wasn’t time, though, for sentimentality Monday, to think about his own Olympic dream, the one that never was. His son Jack, clad in a white gi, was eager to fight. The 21-year-old judoka went through his normal pre-match routine: a hop and a stomp, with plenty of Jersey swagger.Nick, meanwhile, walked over to a small box at the corner of the mat reserved for coaches. He craned his head toward the ceiling of the Arena Champ de Mars, located barely an ippon throw away from Eiffel Tower, and made one plea for his late father.“If you can help me at all … please,” he said.Judo has long been the family business. Yonezuka’s father, Yoshisada, is like the godfather of judo — and not just in New Jersey. He moved to the United States in 1962, starting the Cranford Judo Karate Center in Cranford, N.J., that effectively launched the sport along the East Coast. Jack is the eighth judoka from the club to make an Olympic team. And Yoshisada was the head coach of the U.S. team at the 1988 and ’92 Games.Nick Yonezuka made the 1980 Olympic judo team that would have competed at the Moscow Games, had the United States not boycotted. He’s now coaching his son Jack, the baby-faced judoka from West Long Branch, N.J., who reached the Olympics ahead of schedule and took the mat Monday with both his father and grandfather on his mind.Nick Yonezuka was 16 when he made the 1980 team. The U.S. trials took place after the U.S. Olympic Committee, under pressure from President Carter, had decided to boycott the Moscow Games. He visited the White House with other members of the 1980 Olympic team for a celebration, but that was really it.“I didn’t have an Olympic experience,” he said.He never thought that might be his lone chance. “In my head, I was like, ‘I got plenty more to go,’” Yonezuka said.The bigger heartbreak actually came four years later. He again won at the U.S. trials, but because of the point system deployed at the time, he wasn’t selected for the Olympic team headed to Los Angeles in 1984.“That kind of broke my heart in a way,” he said. “I kept training and doing it, but not in the same way.”Yonezuka didn’t jump right into coaching. Yoshisada kept people an arm’s length away from the business, reluctant to delegate or entrust others to the club.“It was his club,” Nick said. “It wasn’t my club. Not at all. There wasn’t a place for me.”Just as Yoshisada coached Nick, he also served as Jack’s first coach. His grandson wasn’t the fastest or the most talented in the dojo. But he never stopped working.“He’s like a shark that can’t stop,” Nick said. “He keeps going and going.”The sport spoke to Jack. He liked the discipline, the quiet dance, the tussle for power and leverage.“It sounds violent, but I like throwing people,” he said. “I like holding people. When they’re hopeless and they can’t do anything and I have full control, it’s cool.”Things in Cranford changed when Yoshisada was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. Suddenly, Nick had to take a more active role at the club, as both coach and caretaker.“I thought he was going to come back,” Nick said. “When he didn’t, it was like, ‘I guess it’s on me.’” Yoshisada died that same year. Nick said the last thing his father told him was, “Take care of the club.”“That’s with me,” Nick said. “I’m doing the best I can.”This is what Jack carried to the mat Monday, though he did his best to focus on the judoka from Moldova who stood opposite him, a 24-year-old named Adil Osmanov.Just 1:22 in, the referee penalized Jack for grabbing below the belt — a shido. Then 1:22 later, the referee raised his arm again, this time giving Jack a shido for inactivity. In judo, three shidos results in a hansoku-make — an automatic disqualification.Despite what the referee saw, Nick liked what his son was doing. Jack, he felt, was the aggressor, close to breaking through. “That guy was done,” Nick said later of the Moldovan foe. “I think he broke in his head.”Neither Jack nor his dad agreed with the first two shidos, but they definitely didn’t like the third. With only 20 seconds remaining in regulation time, the referee thought Jack made illegal contact again. Nick threw his arms in the air in frustration. So did Jack on the mat.Jack swatted a hand and turned to step down. He joined his father, and the two walked slowly out of the competition area.“Jack fought good,” Nick said later. “He didn’t win the match, but the other guy didn’t win the match either. They should try to let the better guy finish it out. The refereeing gets in the way a lot of times. It’s the Olympics, you know what I mean?”Osmanov went in to win bronze in the 73 kilogram weight class (161 pounds), but Jack’s Olympics ended after one match. Nick was happy his son got at least that many. In the small box just off the mat, he was Coach Yonezuka. When would the switch flip and he’d go back into Dad mode?“I almost don’t want it to,” he said. “Because that’ll be more disappointing, you know?”There were immediate plans for a big family dinner — Jack’s mother, Denise, who is originally from Paris, and his 87-year-old grandmother, Anastasia, were among the contingent that made the trek from Jersey — and much bigger plans beyond that.Jack is the youngest member of the U.S. judo squad in Paris. He was happy just to make this team, but now he wants to reach the medal podium four years from now at the Los Angeles Games — hopefully, coached by his father and buoyed by an unmatched family legacy in the sport."
WaPo_83,Simone Biles set to perform on all four apparatuses despite calf injury,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/simone-biles-olympic-gymnastics-team-final-injury/,2024-07-30 02:26:02.661985,,"PARIS — Simone Biles is officially slated to perform on all four apparatuses in Tuesday’s team final, despite dealing with a minor calf injury during the qualifying round. USA Gymnastics announced the team’s lineups for the competition Monday evening, and Biles is poised to have a major role in the Americans’ attempt to win a gold medal.Biles’s coach, Cecile Landi, said after the opening day of women’s competition that during warm-ups before floor Biles felt pain in her calf, the reemergence of an issue from a couple weeks ago. Landi said Biles never considered withdrawing. She finished the meet and soared to the top of the all-around standings. Biles had one of her best performances, finishing nearly two points ahead of her top challenger, Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, and leading the U.S. team to an overall score that was more than five points ahead of the second-place Italy.Scores do not carry over to the team final, but with their difficult routines and Biles’s dominance, the U.S. women have room for error.Chellsie Memmel, the technical lead of the U.S. high performance staff, said before the competition began that Biles would be given the opportunity to perform on fewer apparatuses in the team final if it helped ease the pressure on her. Landi indicated that bars, Biles’s weakest event, would have been the apparatus she skipped.But Biles will be in all four lineups, which also means she has an opportunity to debut a new element on bars that will be named for her if she performs it successfully. Biles did not advance to the bars final, so the team competition and the all-around final are her only remaining chances to unveil that skill — a front circling element with a 1½ pirouette — at these Games.Jade Carey, who said she recently has felt sick, is only in the vault lineup for the team competition. She’s the reigning Olympic gold medalist on floor but struggled in the qualifying round, bailing out of her final tumbling pass. Jordan Chiles is in the lineup on every apparatus. Chiles narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the all-around final; she finished fourth overall, but because Biles and Sunisa Lee scored better, she could not advance. Countries are limited to two athletes per final.In the team final, Lee will compete on bars, beam and floor. Hezly Rivera, 16, will not compete at all. Rivera was shaky on beam in the qualifying round, and that was the apparatus on which she had the best chance of competing. It appears the U.S. staff leaned heavily on the results from the qualifying round when determining lineups."
WaPo_84,How to know if claims made by health products are real or just hype,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/29/health-claims-reality-hype/,2024-07-30 02:00:02.661985,,"Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.Whether you’re shopping for a thermometer or a DIY diagnostic test for urinary tract infections, it can be hard to know what’s useful and what may be misleading, defective or a waste of money. Here are some key tips experts suggested you consider before you click “buy now.”Be wary of “FDA Registered” and “FDA Certified” claims. Phrases like these may imply that a product has undergone a Food and Drug Administration review. But the first term just means the manufacturer has registered the facility where the product is made yearly with the FDA, not that the product has been approved or cleared by the agency. As for the second claim, the FDA doesn’t certify products or issue registration certificates, so at a minimum such claims are misleading.Search the FDA’s site. You can find out whether a device has been cleared by the agency by checking its device database. This means a company has demonstrated that the device is comparable to a product the FDA has already carefully vetted. You can do the same for home medical tests, including some coronavirus home tests, through the FDA’s database of at-home tests. Enter a term such as  “urinary tract infection” in the name of the test, or the company name, and then click “Search.”Check tests for CLIA certification. For at-home tests you use and then send back to a lab for results to be analyzed, such as a genetic test, check the label or online description to make sure the lab is “CLIA certified.” This means that the test meets federal quality standards and that the lab undergoes regular inspections before it can accept human samples for testing. Consider that a bare minimum.Talk to your medical providers. They can help you think through a potential purchase or may know of an easier, less expensive way to get the answers you’re interested in. For example, your doctor could order a test to check your cholesterol levels, rather than have you buy one yourself. Or they may have specific recommendations about home monitoring devices so you’re not left to comparison shop on your own.Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.

WaPo_85,Flash flood at Dollywood forces fans to flee in high water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/29/dollywood-flood-video/,2024-07-30 02:00:02.661985,,"Dollywood fans enjoying a summer weekend had to flee the Tennessee theme park Sunday after strong storms sent floodwaters rushing through the park, forcing some to wade through nearly waist-deep water to get to their cars.Photos and videos captured on social media showed brown water surging through pedestrian areas and building up in the parking lot.“Craziest Dollywood experience in my almost 32 years of going,” one person wrote in a TikTok video that showed torrential rains and crowds in ponchos exiting the park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.The resort, which is co-owned by country music superstar Dolly Parton, reopened at noon on Monday after visitors were forced out by the rushing waters Sunday. Two rides that need additional cleanup will be delayed, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported.In a statement on social media, Dollywood wrote that one minor injury had been reported amid the thunderstorm and flash flooding. Fire and police workers from Pigeon Forge helped direct “guests to safety during the storm,” the statement said.The flooding came as slow-moving thunderstorms passed over the area Sunday evening. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning at 5:39 p.m. that remained in effect until 10:45 p.m. The Weather Service said up to 4 to 5 inches of rain caused “multiple road closures, washouts, and even mudslides” in the area.“While the volume of rain was difficult for both the park’s and the city’s infrastructure to manage, the fact we have only one minor injury illustrates how well our hosts handled the situation and how well our guests followed their directions,” Dollywood public relations director Wes Ramey said in a statement.The forecast calls for the possibility of repeated showers and storms between Monday night and Tuesday night that could bring damaging winds in addition to more flooding. Some areas could see an additional 3 inches or more rainfall, the Weather Service said.Please see this park update for Sunday, July 28, and Monday, July 29.Bryan McCarter, vice mayor of Sevier County, wrote on his Facebook page Sunday night that “significant flooding” was occurring in parts of the county. He wrote that several roads — including one near Dollywood — were closed because of water or washout.Several people wrote on social media accounts that they were not able to leave the parking lot because of the floods.“Didn’t have being stranded in the @Dollywood parking lot due to major flooding on my 2024 bingo card,” one person wrote on X with a video of cars driving onto flooded streets as rain continued pouring.“Dollywood is supporting guests whose vehicles were affected by this weather event,” the park’s statement said.The theme park is eight miles north of Great Smoky Mountains National Park and 35 miles southeast of Knoxville, Tenn.Ramey said in the statement that the park will honor tickets with Sunday’s date for a future visit. The park will also accept rain checks that were provided.“We will evaluate the response to determine if any changes are needed moving forward, but we are proud of our maintenance and operations teams for their hard work that allowed us to reopen less than 24 hours after an unprecedented flooding event like this one,” he said."

Another nine children were wounded, and six of those children remain in critical condition at local hospitals.Two adults were also stabbed and are in critical condition. Kennedy said the adults appear to be have been injured while trying to protect the children.The Merseyside Police said they arrested a 17-year-old boy from the nearby village of Banks on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. They also recovered a knife, police said. They said the arrested youth was originally from Cardiff.“We can also confirm that the incident is not currently being treated as terror-related, and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident,” the police said.The attack was at a small community center where primary-school-age children were attending a Taylor Swift-themed yoga and dance class. The building is down an alleyway on Hart Street, a mostly residential road of two-story brick buildings with some scattered shops.“It is understood that the children were attending a Taylor Swift event at a dance school when the offender, who was armed with a knife, walked into the premises and started to attack those inside,” Kennedy said at the news conference. “We believe that the adults who were injured were trying to protect the children at the time they were attacked.”Kennedy added, “As a mum of two daughters, and the nanna of a five-year-old granddaughter, I cannot begin to imagine the pain and suffering the families of the victims are currently going through, and I want to send them our heartfelt condolences and sympathies.”The attack took place a few minutes before noon on the first day of the school holiday.The North West Ambulance Service said it responded to “reports of multiple stabbings” with 13 ambulances and a helicopter. Emergency services crews treated 11 people at the scene. The wounded were taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Aintree University Hospital and Southport and Formby Hospital.”The police described the attack as “ferocious.”Tim Johnson, a journalist at Eye on Southport, told the BBC he saw a bloodied girl on a stretcher.“Her parents were running after her. It was horrendous. I’ve never seen anything like it,” Johnson told the broadcaster.BBC Radio interviewed a man who he said saw young girls “bleeding.” A Press Association reporter interviewed a man who said some of the victims appeared to be around 10 years old.Other witnesses told reporters that parents were running up and down the street, wailing and screaming. Local WhatsApp groups received frenzied messages telling people to go inside and lock doors.Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the stabbings as “horrendous and deeply shocking news.”A motive for the stabbings was not immediately clear. The arrested youth will be interviewed by detectives, the police said, and officers were seen at the house where he is believed to live.Southport is a seaside town known for its beaches and Victorian architecture, about an hour’s drive north of Liverpool. It has a population of about 95,000."

WaPo_88,"9,800 miles from Paris, Olympic surfers take on Tahiti’s ‘wall of skulls’",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/olympic-surfing-tahiti-paris-teahupoo/,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"The best surfers dream of waves that are almost, but not quite, unsurfable.The glorious and notorious Teahupo’o can be that kind of wave, thundering just off the coast of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It is especially rowdy between April and September, which is why Olympic surfers are competing half a world away from Paris — about midway between California and Australia, in the same time zone as Honolulu.Surf willing, medals could be awarded as soon as July 30.The wave is created by a unique convergence of hydrodynamics, geology and geometry. What makes it beautiful and enticing also makes it treacherous.“If it were a ski run,” said former pro surfer Jessi Miley-Dyer, “it’d be like a triple black diamond.”Teahupo’o is the name of both the wave and the onshore town, and it loosely translates to “wall of skulls” or “broken skulls.” Either way, you get the gist.It was considered too intense to surf until the 1980s and ’90s, and at least five surfers have died trying to ride it.Surfers call it one of the “heaviest” waves in the world, a description that means dangerous but also powerful, said Miley-Dyer, who is commissioner of the World Surf League.“It’s a reef break, which means you can hit the reef, and it’s quite shallow in parts,” she said. “But it’s heavy because the wave itself is really thick. So you have all of this water that’s unloading on the reef.”All that water starts with violent storms thousands of miles away, near the South Pole.The storms unleash swells of water and energy that flow largely unimpeded until they roar up the base of the dormant volcano that formed Tahiti and slam into the reef surrounding it.It is this near-instant transition from deep to shallow water that gives the wave its hollow shape and power, said Kevin Wallis, director of forecasting for Surfline, the company doing the forecasting and condition reports for the Olympic competition.As a swell approaches, its water churns in a somersaulting motion, pulling water off the reef as the top shelf of the wave collapses over itself.The wave face at Teahupo’o can range from a few feet tall to 50 feet — 6 to 15 feet is typical, Willis said. But because of the unusual hydrodynamics, surfers riding within the barrel of the wave are actually below sea level, and the water below the break is shallow.Athletes have little cushion if they are slammed into the reef or dragged across its sharp coral surface.If the reef were just a wall of coral, the wave would break all at once — surfers call that a closeout — and it wouldn’t be good to ride, Willis said. There would be no long, tapered curl.But at one particular notch, it is as if the stream that has flowed there for millennia decided to sculpt the ideal spot for surfing.Coral grows only in salt water, so the reef formed at an angle just outside the reach of fresh water coming out of the stream’s mouth. The persistent water rumbling down the mountain carved a deep channel out of the soft volcanic rock.So when a swell slams against one particular notch in the reef, the water creates a long, tapered barrel as it rises up and folds over before dissipating.“If you told somebody, ‘Okay, create a shape that would absorb a wave energy in the shortest distance possible,’ well, it would be that exact angle that that reef has grown,” said surfing legend Laird Hamilton, who bent surfers’ minds when he conquered a monster wave at Teahupo’o in 2000.“All of the wave’s energy will dissipate in one crash, literally. And that’s why it heaves up and creates a giant cylinder and then explodes, because it’s taking the wave’s energy and within a couple hundred feet, it’s completely absorbing it.”That means the nearby lagoons are like sanctuaries, Hamilton said. “You wouldn’t even know that there was a wave outside.”Miley-Dyer said the shallow, clear water below combined with the towering mountain backdrop makes Teahupo’o “one of the most visually unreal waves to surf.” At the same time, the maelstrom is so intense that a surfer can’t just admire the view.“You have this experience of one of the prettiest, most beautiful waves in the world,” she said. “And at the same time you’re like, I’ve got to really focus. You can’t just muck around.”Sally Jenkins and Adrián Blanco Ramos contributed to this report.Sources: Bathymetry data via French Hydrographic Office (SHOM), Surfline, and satellite image ©2024 Maxar Technologies."
WaPo_89,"After an NBA career, he’s hanging on the beach … as an Olympian",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/chase-budinger-nba-olympics-beach-volleyball/,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"PARIS — At some point on the Eiffel Tower center court, Chase Budinger should’ve looked up and soaked it all in.He was making his debut in Olympic beach volleyball on Monday afternoon, playing in a rowdy environment as competing red, white and blues filled the grandstands and the most emblematic image of Paris towered in the background. Yet Budinger was too busy defending the net and setting up partner Miles Evans in their 2-0 win over France to truly appreciate this postcard come to life.Budinger and Evans spent only 32 minutes with their toes in the sand. Not enough time to appreciate the view. Yet plenty enough for others to appreciate the enormity of the moment.Decades ago, a young Budinger created a dream board, and on it, he placed the Olympic rings. A big dream, but as a dual-sport athlete, Budinger had not specifically envisioned following the footsteps of the NBA players on Team USA, nor representing his country in men’s volleyball. He just wanted to go to the Olympics. On Monday, he made history as the first athlete to play in the NBA and on an Olympic beach volleyball team.At 36, and more than eight years removed from his final appearance in the NBA, Budinger’s dream board has become a reality.“It’s definitely lived up to expectations,” Budinger said of his first Olympics moment. “This was absolutely unbelievable. Absolutely breathtaking, and the feeling out there is unreal.”There’s plenty of crossover between Budinger’s two passions. He still gets to wear a tank top and shorts to the office, only now he can pair it with wraparound shades. And the volleyball crowd loves big blocks just as much as NBA fans.While Budinger wasn’t known as a towering rim protector in the league, he’s the 6-foot-7 net minder on the beach. In the second set, when Budinger stuffed one of the French players at the net to pull the Americans ahead 9-6, a man wearing a bucket hat with blue stars borrowed the finger wag celebration made famous by Dikembe Mutombo finger. No, no, no!Budinger made no such audacious display. Though it might have been apt, after one of his four blocks for points, for Budinger to extend his index finger to his lips, as he and Evans spent the afternoon silencing the mostly pro-French audience.Budinger should understand the power of a home court advantage, and as he felt — not just heard — the cheers for the French duo Arnaud Gauthier-Rat and Youssef Krou, he knew that the Americans were on enemy territory. And he loved it.“It was so loud in there. The French fans really came out to support their team, [they] were howling,” said Budinger. He turned to Evans during the French players’ introduction and said: “‘Man, this is a great feeling!’ I love playing against this. And it just brought back a lot of memories going into NBA arenas and playing on the road.”Budinger played seven years in the NBA, mostly in a role of athletic guy off the bench. During the 2012 NBA all-star slam dunk contest, he riffed from the movie “White Men Can’t Jump,” dressing as Woody Harrelson’s character and leaping over rapper Sean Combs. (If he owned a time machine, he’d surely go back and pick any other human to leap.) In the 2016-17 season, Budinger went to Spain to lengthen his career. But after one year overseas, he thought about his future. More specifically, his future in volleyball.“I knew this was the route that I wanted to take, but I do remember asking myself if this was the right decision at the time of quitting basketball,” Budinger said. “Am I doing the right thing for myself? But after sulking three weeks,” he said, “I kind of changed my mindset.”Budinger didn’t treat the beach as a hobby in retirement. He traveled the globe for competitions, sought out Evans as a partner and trained five times a week. All for the goal of making the Olympics. Along the way, he’s earned admiration from his former colleagues.Evans posted a video of members of the Team USA men’s basketball team greeting Budinger ahead of the Opening Ceremonies on Friday.“Congrats! I’ve been paying attention. I’ve been watching,” LeBron James could be heard telling Budinger in the video.After the Monday match, Gauthier-Rat of the French team showed admiration for how Budinger made the transition from hardwood to sand.“Big respect,” Gauthier-Rat said. “I don’t know if it has to do with his NBA experience, but from my perspective, he was the only composed player on the court. The three others, his partner and both of us, were more stressed and feeling more pressure. He was more relaxed … and that made a difference.”His basketball past might’ve taught Budinger to keep a calm facade, but he admitted feeling the “ultimate nerves” just like he did ahead of his NBA debut. However, after the stadium announcer introduced Budinger as the American player who was “making history,” he and Evans meshed perfectly together while breezing to the two-set win. Next match, Budinger knows, he should try to slow it down a little, and relish in his dream.“I felt like it went too fast,” Budinger said. “I felt like there were times when I should’ve enjoyed the view a little more, or maybe the timeouts could be a little longer for us so that we can enjoy it.”"
WaPo_90,Congress names members of task force on Trump rally shooting,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/29/trump-shooting-congressional-investigation-bipartisan-committee/,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) have tapped seven Republican and six Democratic lawmakers to serve on a bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.All 13 lawmakers have backgrounds and experience relevant to the committee’s role: seeking accountability and answers after a gunman wounded the former president, killed one person and critically injured two others during a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), who represents Butler County and has ties to law enforcement in the area, was appointed to chair the panel. He is joined by Republican Reps. Mark Green (Tenn.), David Joyce (Ohio), Laurel Lee (Fla.), Michael Waltz (Fla.), Clay Higgins (La.) and Pat Fallon (Tex.).From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jason Crow (Colo.), a former Army ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was appointed the panel’s ranking Democrat. Democratic Reps. Lou Correa (Calif.), Madeleine Dean (Pa.), Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.), Glenn Ivey (Md.) and Jared Moskowitz (Fla.) are the other members.“We have the utmost confidence in this bipartisan group of steady, highly qualified, and capable Members of Congress to move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and help make certain such failures never happen again,” Johnson and Jeffries said in a joint statement.They said the task force will have subpoena authority and will assume control over all House committee investigations into the assassination attempt.In a deeply polarized Congress, similar commissions have seen mixed results in recent years. But so far, lawmakers have demonstrated an unusually serious and cooperative approach toward investigating the attempted assassination of Trump, the former president and 2024 Republican nominee. Republicans protested the last high-profile select committee formed by a Democratic-led House to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Only two Republicans ultimately served on it.The three primary goals of this panel include understanding the security and communications breakdowns that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, to open fire from a rooftop that was just outside the security perimeter of the outdoor rally; ensuring accountability; and preventing Secret Service failure going forward. The last shooting at a U.S. leader under Secret Service protection was in 1981, when a gunman fired at President Ronald Reagan as he left a speaking engagement at the Washington Hilton.Senate lawmakers are set to hold a hearing with acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate on Tuesday.In the days since the shooting, lawmakers have been frustrated by the lack of detailed information offered by the Secret Service.A day after a contentious appearance before the House Oversight Committee last week, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her post. FBI Director Christopher A. Wray offered a more detailed account of the assassination attempt in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, though he also angered some lawmakers by saying Trump was wounded by either a bullet or shrapnel. The bureau later clarified that investigators believe Trump was wounded by either a bullet or a bullet fragment.Ivey, a former assistant U.S. attorney who serves on two of the House committees that have already launched investigations into the shooting, said the task force will have to quickly collect information from multiple sources to put together a comprehensive account of what happened that day. During a visit to the Butler, Pa., site after the shooting, Ivey said, he found local law enforcement officials and people on the ground who were “more than willing to share their insight.”A former U.S. government official who has experience with past investigations into major security incidents said that lawmakers should focus on putting together an independent timeline to compare it against the official protection plan crafted by Secret Service ahead of the rally.That will assist members in determining “whether it was the plan itself that was wrong, whether they gave short shrift to what the envelope of protection looked like or if somebody didn’t do their job — and why,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly about sensitive security issues.Since the assassination attempt, Secret Service officials have encouraged the Trump campaign to avoid large outdoor rallies, The Washington Post reported last week. But Trump over the weekend wrote in a post on Truth Social that he would continue to stage such rallies."
WaPo_91,U.S. gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik is at the Olympics for one reason. He delivered.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/stephen-nedoroscik-us-mens-gymnastics-paris-olympics-medal/,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"PARIS — There’s pressure all over this city. It will live here for two weeks during these Olympics, at every venue and inside the thumping hearts of athletes in every medal-deciding moment. It’s inescapable, and after more than two hours on the sideline during the men’s gymnastics team final, American Stephen Nedoroscik finally had his turn under a career-defining spotlight.He’s a specialist, here because he excels on a single event: pommel horse, an apparatus so fickle that one misstep can derail an athlete’s rhythm and send the routine into disarray. And in the waning moments of Monday’s final, Nedoroscik had to deliver for the United States to clinch its first Olympic team medal since 2008. He leapt onto the apparatus and began swinging, floating through each element and maneuvering his hands with precision. His teammates watched with their arms around each other, and as soon as he dismounted, the celebration began.Nedoroscik had done more than enough to clinch the bronze medal, with the Americans’ score of 257.793 landing firmly in bronze medal position behind men’s gymnastics powerhouses Japan and China. In a testament to how much the Americans have progressed since their distant fifth-place finish at the Tokyo Games three years ago, the U.S. men finished less than two points behind Japan, the gold medalist with a 259.594.The other top teams had errors; the Americans were the exception. China, the silver medalist, entered the final rotation with a significant lead, but Su Weide fell twice during his high bar routine, sending his team tumbling to second. Meanwhile, the U.S. men hit all 18 routines of the evening, Nedoroscik’s key 40-second performance an exclamation point on what his teammates had done throughout the meet. They had struggled through the qualifying round, but when it counted, the U.S. men were at their best.Entering the last rotation, the United States sat in third with nearly a two-point buffer ahead of Ukraine in fourth. The cushion provided some reassurance, but the final three pommel horse sets dictated whether the United States would leave with a long-awaited Olympic team medal.Paul Juda, who’s been the steadiest member of the team at these Games, began the rotation with a solid set. Brody Malone, the lone returning Olympian on this team, had a disastrous outing in the qualifying round, falling on pommel horse and struggling on other events. But his rebound performance continued to the final event, and his hit routine set up Nedoroscik to finish the job. After Nedoroscik stepped down from the platform that holds the equipment and placed his glasses back onto his face, he was swarmed with his teammates and coaches. The hugs seemed never-ending. For the Americans, a breakthrough bronze felt as meaningful as a gold.The U.S. men won the bronze at last fall’s world championships, their first in nearly decade, which sparked optimism that this year, they could end the Olympic drought. The absence of Russia, which isn’t allowed to have teams compete here because of its invasion of Ukraine, created an opening on the podium.But when the United States landed in fifth after the qualifying round — behind Britain and Ukraine, in addition to China and Japan — the team’s medal hopes seemed bleak. The Americans were more than three points behind third-place Britain, in large part because Malone’s mistakes.The United States couldn’t lean on simple routines with the hope that clean execution would clinch a medal. The Americans needed to maximize difficulty scores and perform well. One routine after another in the final, they did just that.The U.S. men delivered a stellar vault rotation starting with Juda’s perfectly stuck 2½-twisting vault that led to so much excitement he was chasséing down the podium afterward. When Malone followed with another stuck vault, “U-S-A” chants filled the arena. And then Asher Hong capped the lineup with a strong vault, the most difficult one on the team. As they rotated to their third event, the chants began again — louder and for longer this time — and the U.S. gymnasts fist-pumped along in acknowledgment.The Americans kept eradicating the stumbles from the qualifying round. Nearly every routine was similar or better than the team’s previous outing, and Malone led that turnaround. After coming off the high bar twice on Saturday, he worked through his difficult set this time without any trouble. Just before Malone, Frederick Richard soared through a high-flying routine as his teammates leapt in response to each successful release element and again after his excellent stuck dismount. On that apparatus alone, the Americans improved their score by more than two points. And eventually, they headed to pommel horse with a medal on the line.Nedoroscik had been in a high-stakes moment like this before. He earned a spot on the 2022 world championships team, but in the team final, he failed to perform to his potential. When Syque Caesar began coaching Nedoroscik soon after, he wanted to approach Nedoroscik’s past mistakes head-on.“We had to peel the layers,” Caesar said, explaining how he worked to pinpoint what exactly went wrong for Nedoroscik in big moments such as 2022 worlds.Nedoroscik won the gold medal at world championships in 2021, but there was work to do in developing consistency. Caesar said it took more thana year to figure out what worked best for Nedoroscik, adding mental cues that helped him deal with varying competitive circumstances. Caesar added “curveballs” to practice. One example, Caesar explained a few weeks ago, was having Nedoroscik sit for two hours and then hit a routine — the precise scenario the 25-year-old found himself in Monday.“He’s embraced the pressure and embraced the curveballs,” Caesar said.In the past, if Caesar upped the pressure in practice, Nedoroscik’s response would be: “You don’t need to put more pressure on me. I already put pressure on myself.” But now he doesn’t try to minimize the weight of the moment. He knows he can handle it. And here, in the biggest moment of his career, he proved it ."

At Misquamicut State Beach, video shows people screaming and panicking as they were surrounded by the insects.But Abbe Ciulla, who visits South Shore Beach two to three times a week during the summer months, said people around her were “awestruck” when the dragonflies arrived.“I’ve never seen anything else like it before. It was really special — like a beautiful shared experience with nature,” Ciulla, 40, told The Washington Post. She recorded and posted a video of the dragonflies, which has received 185,000 views, on her TikTok account.The yoga studio owner said it appeared as though the dragonflies were coming from the ocean around 4 p.m. as the wind shifted. Some brushed against her hair, and others rested on beachgoers’ knees or toes briefly. The whole experience lasted about five minutes, she said.Some people weren’t as excited as Ciulla.“I was enjoying a nice day at Misquamicut State Beach until we endured a dragonfly apocalypse,” beachgoer Stephanie Martin told WCVB5.Many people online suggested that the event had a spiritual meaning.“They are giving us a message,” one person wrote in the replies to Ciulla’s TikTok post. Another said it was heaven’s gates opening.The blue dasher dragonflies were most likely not migrating, according to David W. Gregg, executive director of the Rhode Island Natural History Survey.“They were most likely looking for better habitat. They are especially territorial and defend little patches of pond shore,” Gregg told The Post.He said a milder winter has probably contributed to more dragonflies hatching this year. “Central Massachusetts and Rhode Island have been in a drought the last couple of weeks,” he said. “What happened was their ponds started to dry up and the mosquito population started to decline, and suddenly it put pressure on them.”Typically these dragonflies don’t move in swarms, but it can happen, according to Gregg. The beach is not a good habitat for dragonflies, so they were probably moving north.Gregg says there’s nothing to fear about a dragonfly swarm.“People shouldn’t be afraid. They don’t bite or sting. The worst thing that can happen is they eat all the mosquitoes.”"
WaPo_93,Northern lights could reach midlatitudes early this week. How to see them.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/29/northern-lights-aurora-us-forecast/,2024-07-30 03:00:02.856827,,"Since the weekend, the sun has unleashed multiple waves of plasma that are set to bombard the Earth’s atmosphere and potentially bring colorful displays of the northern and southern lights.The lights, or auroras, may be visible Monday and Tuesday nights, especially in the high latitudes. It’s possible that the northern lights display will reach into the midlatitudes — as far south as Oregon and the lower Midwest, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The potential for the aurora activity comes as the sun is near the peak of an 11-year cycle at which these plasma eruptions occur with greatest frequency. The eruptions, known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), originate from sunspot regions that tend to be particularly active around this solar maximum.A boisterous sunspot region is pointed at the Earth and began releasing CMEs over the weekend. According to SpaceWeather.com, some of them merged, forming a “cannibal CME,” which could produce a strong geomagnetic storm when it arrives at Earth. Geomagnetic storms are what cause auroras.Geomagnetic storms are rated 1 to 5 on the G-scale (G stands for geomagnetic), with 5 being the most intense. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center is predicting conditions ranging from G1 to G3 through early Wednesday.A G3 storm often produces an aurora as far south as the northern half of the United States. Such storms can also have minor effects on power systems and disrupt satellite and low-frequency radio navigation.G1-G3 Watches are out for 29-31 July due to a number of possible CME arrivals. Solar activity increased over the weekend and the Sun has been erupting in solar flares up to include an X1 flare (R3-Strong) on Sunday evening. Visit https://t.co/9VAtkQeOwM... for the full story. pic.twitter.com/3VNJJ9CRgMIn May, a G5 storm hit the Earth, producing an aurora as far south as the tropics. By many accounts, it was the most widespread display in at least two decades.High-latitude locations such as Alaska, Canada and northern Europe have the best chance to see auroras Monday and Tuesday nights.Late Monday and toward Tuesday morning, when the geomagnetic storm may be strongest, the lights could extend south toward the midlatitudes.If the storm materializes as predicted, the lights may be visible into the Midwest, New England and the Pacific Northwest. Spots even farther south, including parts of California, the southern Plains and the Mid-Atlantic, could see a faint glow on the horizon, especially with the aid of long-exposure photography.However, because forecasting the arrival of CMEs is difficult, the timing of the most intense storm activity could shift.To follow the intensity of geomagnetic storm activity, consider monitoring the K-index. If and when this index reaches 7 or higher, that’s when auroras in the midlatitudes are most probable.The aurora forecast for tonight (7/29-7/30) calls for KP7/G3 conditions! Pending favorable data, aurora may be visible overhead in New England and the Midwest - and on the horizon as far south as North Carolina and Oklahoma. pic.twitter.com/5rvix7O5B3Best viewing will be where skies are clear and away from city lights. Clouds are most likely to interfere with viewing in the eastern United States and Pacific Northwest on Monday and Tuesday nights. However, even where clouds are forecast, it’s worth taking a peek outside, as there are sometimes unexpected breaks in the cloud canopy.Because the moon is in its last quarter phase, it will illuminate significantly less than when it was full about 10 days ago.The chance to see the aurora could extend beyond Tuesday night.Because a large sunspot region is facing Earth, there is the chance for more CMEs this week.“The active region is now directly facing our planet and in a great position for Earth directed eruptions,” SolarHam.com, an online resource for space weather and auroras, wrote on X."
WaPo_94,"No, really, Republicans are getting weirder",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/democrats-call-republicans-weird/,2024-07-30 04:00:02.856827,,"It would be strange for Democrats to attack the Republican presidential ticket for being “weird” if it weren’t true. But those men are getting weirder by the day.Former president Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (Ohio), is off to a wobbly start. A Harris 2024 campaign email sent on Friday was headlined, “JD Vance Is a Creep (Who Wants to Ban Abortion Nationwide).” The statement continued, “JD Vance is weird. Voters know it – Vance is the most unpopular VP pick in decades.”It was bad enough when footage resurfaced of a 2021 interview in which Vance called Democrats “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Things got worse last week when Vance offered a non-apology, blaming “people” for “focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said.”Uh, okay, but that doesn’t help at all. The substance — which Vance said he stands by — is asserting that adults without children do not deserve an equal say in the nation’s affairs. Another unearthed clip of Vance showed him arguing that parents, when they vote, should be able to cast an extra ballot for each child in their family who is under voting age. He didn’t take that back, either, going only so far as to claim it was a “thought experiment” and not a firm policy position.The normal thing would have been for Vance to recognize that he said some dumb things and now regrets them. But being Trump’s wingman means never having to say you’re sorry — actually, never being allowed to say you’re sorry.“These are weird people on the other side,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is on Vice President Harris’s list of possible running mates. “My god, they went after cat people. Good luck with that. Turn on the internet and see what cat people do when you go after them.”Trump is weird, too, and that’s increasingly clear. Since last fall, at campaign rallies he has been regularly telling that nonsensical story about a boat, a battery and a shark. When it was pointed out that the whole thing makes no sense and critics laughed at Trump’s ignorance of basic physics, he insisted on his self-proclaimed infallibility. It’s “actually not crazy” and “sort of a smart story,” he told one crowd. Not in this universe, though.Trump also can’t stop talking about “the late, great Hannibal Lecter,” a reference to the fictional cannibal serial killer portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the 1991 film “The Silence of the Lambs.” It’s unclear where “late, great” comes from, since the character does not die in the movie and Hopkins is very much alive. Trump even repeated his Lecter riff during his 92-minute acceptance rant at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. No one knows why.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, another of Harris’s possible vice-presidential picks, said Sunday on Fox News that Trump is getting “older and stranger.” It’s hard to argue with that assessment.Democrats would be foolish to think the weirdness factor alone is enough to defeat Trump and Vance. But a little mockery doesn’t hurt. For months, the party trudged dourly through the campaign as if toward a root canal. Now, suddenly, Democrats are having fun. They can look forward to the coming convention in Chicago as a celebration, a new beginning. The $200 million they have raised since President Biden withdrew and Harris became the presumptive nominee further brightens their mood.Republicans, meanwhile, are struggling to settle on a new strategy. They were all set to run against Biden’s age and fragility. Now, the instinct of some MAGA zealots is to run against Harris’s race and gender — calling her a “DEI hire,” for example, using “diversity, equity and inclusion” as shorthand for “Black, Asian American and female.”A campaign based on unapologetic racism and misogyny — on “othering” Harris as somehow alien to “real” America — would, of course, be vile. It would also require convincing voters that Trump and Vance are regular guys, and, manifestly, they are not.To say that Vance’s attempts at bonhomie are wooden is to insult oaks and maples, as shown by his awkward visit to a Minnesota diner over the weekend. And Trump, meanwhile, has road-tested “laughing Kamala” as a nickname, making fun of the vice president’s robust sense of humor. But at least she has one.Think about it: We’ve heard Trump snarl and mock, we’ve seen him smile, but can anyone remember him laughing out loud? I can’t. Kind of weird, no?"

WaPo_96,"Vance tells donors Harris change was a ‘sucker punch,’ at odds with campaign",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/jd-vance-kamala-harris-campaign/,2024-07-30 05:58:03.046249,,"The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), privately told donors that running against Vice President Harris instead of President Biden made the race more challenging — an admission at odds with the Donald Trump campaign’s public projections of confidence.“All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,” Vance said about Biden’s withdrawal on July 21, according to a recording of his remarks at a Saturday fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minn. “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.”Publicly, the Trump campaign has insisted that Harris replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket has not changed the race, arguing that she shares responsibility for public dissatisfaction with Biden’s leadership. Vance told reporters on July 22, a day after Biden dropped out of the race, that there was no difference in running against Harris versus Biden.“I don’t think the political calculus changes at all,” Vance said. “We were running against Joe Biden’s open border, Kamala Harris’s open border. Kamala Harris supported the green new scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time.”Trump adviser Jason Miller said in a July 22 Fox News interview: “Democrats are a bit of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. And they may have gotten rid of one problem with Joe Biden, but they’ve inherited a whole new problem with Kamala Harris.”Trump himself has expressed nostalgia for running against Biden (“He will always be my first choice”), and at the same time dismissed Harris as “worse than Joe.”Vance, though, gave a different assessment for donors on Saturday ahead of joining Trump at a rally in St. Cloud, Minn. He said Harris was less well-known than Trump or Biden, so Republicans would have to work to shape people’s opinions of her.“We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let’s be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em. Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years. But Kamala Harris, people don’t really know.”Vance said the campaign would try to define Harris based on past positions, which he said included opposing fracking, praising the “defund the police” movement and supporting decriminalization of unauthorized border crossings. The Harris campaign says she won’t ban fracking. She denounced “defund the police” after becoming Biden’s running mate, and the current administration opposes decriminalizing border crossings.At the fundraiser Vance recounted asking Trump’s senior adviser Susie Wiles how the race had changed, and she answered that she was more confident Trump would win because people like Trump’s polices better than Biden’s.Two national polls taken since Biden dropped out showed Trump and Harris within the margin of error, erasing Trump’s earlier leads over Biden in the same surveys.Vance spokesman Will Martin said Monday in a statement: “Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.”Meryl Kornfield contributed to this report."
WaPo_97,Fairfax plans to regulate data centers amid concerns about industry’s growth,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/29/fairfax-data-centers-zoning/,2024-07-30 05:58:03.046249,,"With the data center industry continuing to expand throughout Virginia, the state’s largest local government plans to adopt policies Tuesday meant to avoid problems with noise, the buildings’ proximity to homes and the power lines providing electricity to them that have afflicted other communities.Fairfax County has just a handful of data centers, primarily because there aren’t many available large tracts of land in the community that can host the mammoth-sized facilities whose thousands of computer servers process the data that makes the internet and cloud computing possible, county officials say.But the county of 1.1 million residents has seen an uptick in the development of smaller “edge” data centers that make connectivity even faster in densely populated areas, officials say.The growth has prompted a board of supervisors vote Tuesday to amend the county’s zoning ordinance to restrict where and how data centers can be built — a step also occurring in other communities such as Loudoun and Prince William counties as concerns about noise and the massive amounts of energy consumed by data centers ripple across the region.“We want to have data centers in Fairfax County, but we want to make sure that we’re steering them not only to the right zoning categories but also that we have the right environmental, noise abatement and other protections in place,” said Jeffrey C. McKay (D), chair of the county’s board.“What’s most important is that we are getting ahead of this problem,” McKay continued. “That we’re not finding ourselves in a Prince William or Loudoun situation,” where, despite the large influx of local tax revenue generated by the industry, its rapid growth has led to an angry backlash from residents and community groups.Among other things, the proposal before the Fairfax board would allow data centers as large as 80,000 square feet as a “by right” use — meaning no special exceptions would need to be approved — in industrial areas of the county. Facilities as large as 40,000 square feet would be allowed as a by right use in some areas zoned for commercial use.All of the buildings would be required to be at least 200 feet away from residential properties, with equipment at least 500 feet away and kept out of view. And the facilities would have to be at least a half mile from the nearest Metro station, unless a special exception is granted for a shorter distance, with proof that they are in compliance with the county’s zoning ordinance.Environmental groups and some county residents are pushing for even stricter requirements, while industry advocates say they go too far.The proposed guidelines “are fairly prescriptive and suggest a relatively narrow aperture in terms of the number of developable parcels and the design aspects the County may consider for data center projects,” Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition industry group, said in a statement. “This may limit the number of developers interested in investing and the number of potential projects.”Homeowners near the site of a planned 466,000-square-foot data center in the county’s eastern Bren Mar area argue that the restrictions should apply to projects like that one, which have been submitted to the county but are not yet approved for construction.That project is currently allowed as a by right development. But its proximity to nearby homes — just over 200 feet away — and to the Van Dorn Street Metro station could make it subject to a special exception hearing if the board decided to include it in the zoning amendment, those residents argue.Not including it “would basically shut off any kind of opportunity that we would have to have a public hearing on this,” Tyler Ray, president of the homeowners association in the nearby Bren Pointe neighborhood of townhouses, said in an interview Monday. “The county isn’t doing anything to protect us.”During a four-hour public hearing on the zoning change earlier this month, other groups called for the county board to expand the distance from the nearest homes to at least 500 feet and make all new data center construction subject to a special exception hearing.“Data centers might be one of the most pivotal issues of our generation,” Renee Grebe, a conservation advocate with the Nature Forward environmental group, said during that hearing. The zoning changes under consideration “will have decades-long consequences on our county and us residents,” she added.That sense of urgency stems from broader projections about the industry’s growth and its impact on the portion of the nation’s power grid that includes Virginia, D.C., Maryland and 10 other states as data centers handle more energy-intensive artificial intelligence technology.Recently, the Dominion Energy utility estimated that the industry’s demand for electricity in its service area will quadruple by 2040 to nearly 14 gigawatts, or enough to power 11.2 million homes.Meanwhile, Loudoun County is preparing to adopt its own zoning amendment that will also further regulate the industry, with the county board considering a proposal to require new data center projects to include plans for a microgrid that would supply the facility with its own electricity.Prince William, the area’s second-largest market, is also working to regulate the industry.“If we continue to try to meet the power needs of the data center community through the traditional regional grid structure, we will fail,” said Loudoun Supervisor Michael R. Turner (D-Ashburn), who is spearheading his county’s zoning amendment effort.Turner noted that the region’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has warned power failures are a possibility in the coming years if more energy is not delivered to the region. The organization recently approved $5.2 billion of transmission lines projects meant to ensure grid reliability, including one that connects Northern Virginia to coal plants in West Virginia, and is planning to solicit bids for even more power line projects while relying in part on fossil fuel plants for extra energy.Turner argued those fixes won’t occur in time.“We won’t have the build out on these new lines until 2028 and AI is here,” he said.McKay, the Fairfax chair, said the county is not seeking to add to the problem by becoming a major market for data centers. But the county nonetheless wants to prepare for the inevitability that the industry’s footprint will spread further into Fairfax, he said.“Who knew when this started that this was where this was going to end up?” McKay said. “I’m not criticizing Loudoun or Prince William, per se, but I am saying that don’t want to end up in a situation they’re in.”"
WaPo_98,Summer time in Canada: McIntosh adds 400 IM gold to her medal collection,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/summer-mcintosh-canada-swimming-paris-olympics/,2024-07-30 05:31:03.046249,,"NANTERRE, France — The freshly constructed pool deck at Paris La Defense Arena, stretched atop the floor of a rugby stadium in Paris’s western suburbs, looks like it was designed for victory laps, with vast expanses of blue flooring that spread in a semicircle all the way out to the first few rows of seats. On Monday night, minutes after the final of the women’s 400-meter individual medley, that proved beneficial, and also time-consuming.Summer McIntosh, the newly minted gold medalist, had a lot of constituencies to visit.There was her family — mom, dad, sister — in the corner nearest the medal stand, and within seconds of the ending of “O Canada,” which McIntosh sang while toggling between English and French, the way she learned in grammar school, she headed straight for them. What followed was a four-way hug that started as a tidy square but soon collapsed into a nebulous blob of trembling limbs and teary faces.“I know they would have been proud of me, no matter what,” McIntosh said. “But to be able to give them a big group hug was pretty cool.”There were her Team Canada teammates and other supporters, who handed her the iconic red-and-white maple leaf flag that the 17-year-old phenom wore draped around her slender shoulders for the rest of her victory lap. “It’s Summer Time in Canada,” read a handmade sign held by one of them.There were her coaches, one Canadian, one Floridian, both of whom had a hand in her rise from a precocious kid whose first love was figure skating into a young woman who just became, if she wasn’t already, the consensus best all-around female swimmer in the world.And there were her teammates from the Sarasota Sharks, the Florida club team where McIntosh and her mom decamped two years ago to escape Canada’s stricter covid restrictions and put the finishing touches on the training that, this week in Paris, already has her in possession of one gold and one silver, with three events still to come.What McIntosh did Monday night, in obliterating the field in her signature event, could not have surprised any of those who knew her. It’s simply what she does. But anyone in the building unfamiliar with her exploits would have been left in awe.Her time of 4 minutes 27.71 seconds failed to lower her own world record from this May — though she flirted with it in the first half — but it was good enough for a blowout win over Americans Katie Grimes (4:33.40) and Emma Weyant (4:34.93). It was the largest margin of victory in the event since Tracy Caulkins’s won by more than nine seconds in Los Angeles in 1984.“Incredible to see,” said Canadian teammate Kylie Masse. “She’s an inspiration to everyone.”In fact, the most unimpressed person on the premises may have been McIntosh herself, who never lost her composure, either in the pool, on the medal stand, or in her brief visit with the media.To hear her tell it, there was not a shred of relief in meeting the massive expectations that had been placed on her in this race, as she entered with more sub-4:30 swims (six) than the rest of the field combined (zero). To hear her tell it, she already had moved on in her mind to the 200 butterfly, her next event.“Absolutely not,” she shot back when asked if there was relief mixed with her joy. “There’s definitely a lot of anticipation going into the race, but I wouldn’t say there are necessarily nerves. There’s no relief. I’m really just trying to soak up every moment I have at the Games … because obviously these moments only come around every four years.”To Brent Arckey, McIntosh’s coach in Sarasota, her preternatural composure is no accident. They talk frequently about handling the pressure and the chaos of an Olympics. He has put her through media training to the point she can parry a tough question like a fencer. She may be 17, but having been through one Olympics in Tokyo at the age of 14, then having won four world championships in the intervening three years, she’s already something of an international veteran.“She’s great in this environment,” he said, “and I’m just proud how that’s progressed and how she’s learned to manage all this. … She knows when to turn it on, turn it off, be a kid, and be a champion.”Though no one was catching McIntosh, the American duo of Grimes and Weyant dueled each other, as well as Great Britain’s Freya Constance Colbert (fourth place, 4:35.67), to earn the right to flank McIntosh on the medal stand. Grimes, 18, held second place the entire race, pushing McIntosh in the front half before fading back, while Weyant had to come back from fifth at the 200-meter mark to will her way to a bronze.Along with Ryan Murphy’s bronze in the men’s 100 backstroke and Luke Hobson’s bronze in the men’s 200 freestyle, it gave the United States a second straight four-medal night. A third of the way through this nine-day meet, the Americans lead their rivals from Australia on the overall medal table, 11 to 6, though the Aussies have the advantage in golds, three to two. On Monday night, Aussies Mollie O’Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus went gold-silver in the women’s 200 free.The night, though, belonged to McIntosh — and by extension, to Canada, which is a rare thing to say at an Olympic swimming pool. McIntosh’s gold was just the 10th in the program’s history. Sprinter Penny Oleksiak is the country’s most decorated Olympic swimmer, amassing seven medals total, but only one was gold. Alex Baumann and George Hodgson top the list of gold medal winners, with two each, but neither won any additional medals.In other words, with a massive meet in Paris — she already had a silver from Saturday’s 400-meter freestyle — McIntosh could immediately vault herself into the discussion of the greatest Canadian swimmers of all time. Still to come for her: the 200 IM, the 200 fly and the 4x200 free relay.Much of the world may be focused on the U.S.-Australia rivalry at this meet, or on French sensation Leon Marchand, who blitzed the field in Sunday night’s 400 IM the same way McIntosh did. There will be three more Katie Ledecky events, with the freestyle legend taking aim at some massive chunks of history.But in Canada, and in a corner of the Florida Gulf coast as well, these Olympics are quickly becoming known as the Summer Games."
WaPo_99,Far-right in uproar after Israel detains reservists over Gaza detainee abuse,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/israel-gaza-prison-sde-teiman/,2024-07-30 05:24:03.046249,,"JERUSALEM — Chaos broke out at an Israeli military base holding Palestinian detainees Monday, as far-right demonstrators rallied after nine reservists were detained in connection to allegations of “serious abuse of a detainee.”The detentions of the reservists who were serving at the prison followed months of international pressure and domestic legal scrutiny over conditions inside Sde Teiman, a facility on a military base in the Negev desert that holds Palestinian detainees captured in Gaza.Videos on social media Monday showed a crowd rattling the base’s metal gates, and then running inside behind a member of the country’s parliament.“That is Zvi Sukkot,” shouted one of the protesters, before the far-right lawmaker slipped through the gate. Online, political allies, including those in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet, quickly seized on the moment.“I’m calling on the chief military prosecutor, get your hands off the reservists,” Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, wrote on X. “Take your hands off the reservists,” posted Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s far-right national security minister who oversees the prison system.Netanyahu condemned the break-in and called for calm. The army’s chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, described the incident as “extremely serious and against the law.”“We are in the midst of a war, and actions of this type endanger the security of the state,” he said in a statement. “We are working to restore order at the base.”The abuse of Palestinian prisoners has accelerated sharply across the penal system since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, according to rights groups, lawyers and former detainees, who say that torture, sexual abuse and deprivation of food have become commonplace.The Israeli army said the nine suspects were detained “for questioning on suspicion of serious abuse of a detainee.”Military detention camps like Sde Teiman have served as an initial holding point for Palestinians detained in Gaza. After weeks, sometimes months, in detention, those who are later alleged to have militant links are typically transferred into the Israeli prison system; others are released without charge, often after weeks of abuse and interrogation, according to the testimony of former detainees.Palestinian prisoners newly released from Sde Teiman describe being beaten, denied medical care and made to kneel handcuffed and blindfolded for days. In May, a CNN investigation found the camp was divided into two parts: enclosed areas housing groups of shackled detainees — some handcuffed so tightly they had to have body parts surgically removed — and a field hospital, where patients in blindfolds and diapers were strapped to beds and force-fed through straws.In June, Khaled Mahajna, a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, was the first lawyer granted access to a prisoner in Sde Teiman. He told the Al Araby news outlet that he heard reports of detainees being raped and tortured.Naji Abbas, director of the prisoners and detainees department for Physicians for Human Rights Israel, said his organization had interviewed former Sde Teiman detainees who reported cases of others being raped and sexually assaulted there, as well as in Israeli prison facilities.On Monday, rights groups welcomed the detention of the soldiers from Sde Teiman but warned that a single investigation did not go far enough.“While it is crucial to investigate and hold the guards accountable, this probe does not address the widespread torture, described in countless testimonies that have accumulated over the past several months,” said Ari Remez, a spokesman for the Adalah legal rights group.The opposition to the military’s investigation from elected officials on Monday reflected “a deep culture of impunity in Israel, rooted in years of Israeli authorities and courts shielding perpetrators of severe violence against Palestinians,” he said.The Israeli government offered its first public accounting of the previously secret detentions in May, saying that authorities had detained about 4,000 Palestinians in Gaza since the war began, and released 1,500 of them for lack of evidence.Israel’s far-reaching Unlawful Combatants Law permits a form of administrative detention, or incarceration without trial. Under the 2002 law, Palestinians from Gaza can be jailed up to 45 days without a detention order, and can be held up to 75 days without seeing a judge and up to six months without legal consul. They are not classified as prisoners of war.Rights groups say the law has created a black hole ripe for the abuse and torture of Gazan detainees disappearing into military custody.After months of mounting international scrutiny and domestic legal challenges, in early June Israeli authorities announced they had begun transferring hundreds of Gazan detainees to other military-run facilities. The development came in response to a petition before Israel’s Supreme Court challenging the detention center’s legality and calling for its closure due to abuse and torture allegations.“Egregious violations at Sde Teiman make depriving these people of liberty blatantly unconstitutional,” the Tel Aviv-based Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), among the five rights group petitioning, said in a statement at the time.As of July 18, according to ACRI, the government had transferred more than 700 detainees out of Sde Teiman while around 40 Gazan detainees remained at the site. Palestinians from Gaza are now primarily held at other military detention sites, mainly Ofer and Anatot in the occupied West Bank and Ketziot in the southern Negev desert, as well as makeshift sites run by Israel's intelligence agencies.“The conditions at Sde Teiman gravely violate both Israeli and international law,” ACRI said in a statement last week. “Its continued operation is not just illegal — it’s a potential war crime. ... It’s illegal to hold any detainees there, whether it’s 10 or 100, for a week or six months.”In another round of legal battles, rights groups have sought access to Gazan detainees and demanded the state account for the thousands of men who disappeared into the system and whose whereabouts have remained unknown for months. Israel has barred the International Red Cross from accessing any Palestinians in detention since Oct. 7.Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report."
WaPo_100,"D.C. meets goal to add 36,000 housing units ahead of schedule",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/29/dc-housing-goal/,2024-07-30 05:21:03.046249,,"D.C. has surpassed a goal Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) set to add 36,000 housing units to the market by 2025 — a housing construction boom that officials expect to cool rocketing rental prices in a city that has long struggled with major housing affordability challenges.Addressing a large crowd of city employees at the new Department of Housing and Community Development headquarters in Anacostia, Bowser reflected on what led her administration to set the ambitious goal five years ago. With housing costs on the rise and the housing market still catching up to D.C.'s population boom, Bowser said one thing was clear: The city needed to rapidly build thousands of new homes.“We have good paying jobs, we have great transportation, we have incredible amenities and so when you have all of those things, the demand on housing is high,” Bowser said. “When we came together in 2019, I told you we can’t undo the previous 15 years — but we can double down on what we’re doing now.”The District eclipsed the goal with the completion this week of Terrace Manor Apartments in Ward 8, a formerly dilapidated complex that a D.C. developer bought out of receivership and rebuilt. In exchange for funds from D.C.'s Housing Production Trust Fund, the city’s main vehicle to build affordable housing, the developer, WC Smith, pledged to keep all 130 new units affordable for the next 50 years.Among the 36,000-plus new homes added to the housing market, Bowser set a goal to make 12,000 of them affordable for households earning below 80 percent of the area median income, or $121,700 for a family of four based on the median income of about $152,000. Bowser said Monday the city expects to achieve that goal next year, with several projects in the pipeline — although not every neighborhood appears on track to meet its target.Bowser set the housing goal  as government leaders across the region were grappling with a serious problem: a drastic gap between housing supply and demand.That problem was especially pronounced in the District, which experienced dramatic population growth beginning in the late 2000s, spurring an economic development boom. The city’s population ballooned by more than 100,000 between 2000 and 2015, driven largely by  young professionals in the latter half of the period. That huge growth in turn accelerated gentrification and displacement, reshaped entire neighborhoods — and hiked rents.Data from D.C.'s Office of Revenue Analysis, an arm of the chief financial office, puts in perspective how significantly new housing production accelerated in recent years. While D.C. managed to add more than 36,000 new housing units over  only five and a half years, by comparison, the city added about 40,000 new units in the previous 18 years, according to a 2020 study from the ORA in partnership with Howard University.The study estimated that, if not for the city’s plan to build 36,000 new units, rents could be 5.5 percent higher by 2025.Bowser’s goal was part of a regionwide effort by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments to increase the housing supply — though as of last year only a few jurisdictions, including D.C., were on track to meet their own targets by 2030.Leah Hendey, a principal research associate at the Urban Institute who studies D.C.'s housing market, described the District as a leader in addressing a regionwide housing shortage problem, owing in part to major investments that have incentivized more affordable housing production over the past decade. Since taking office in 2015, Bowser has invested more than $1.3 billion in the Housing Production Trust Fund.“It is really important that they’ve been adding these units to the housing stock, because they’re desperately needed,” Hendey said. “And I think increasing the housing supply is going to help with affordability in the market overall. That’s not something that happens overnight, though. It’s going to take some time, because we were making up that shortfall of housing to begin with.”Terrace Manor is one of almost 200 buildings added to the District’s stock of apartment buildings since 2019, ORA data shows. Many of the new buildings have been concentrated in the Waterfront/Near Southwest and Central Washington planning areas — according to a city map — as a succession of new luxury apartment buildings remade the city’s skyline.Hendey said natural market forces stemming from D.C.'s population boom — and, in turn, a housing demand boom — were largely to thank for the acceleration in housing production in the mid- and late-2010s. But she said a number of D.C. policies contribute to higher housing production as well: For one, more land is zoned for multifamily housing, making it easier to build. D.C. pumps significantly more money into affordable housing than its neighbors through its Housing Production Trust Fund, she said. And the city also seizes on opportunities to require affordable housing when developments are built on public land, such as an affordable housing plan slated for the Chevy Chase Library and community center.“D. C. has really incentivized and set the stage for folks investing in affordable housing in more robust ways than any other jurisdiction in this region,” Hendey said.Nina Albert, D.C.'s deputy mayor for planning and economic development, said the city’s consistent efforts — including the use of federal pandemic dollars to further boost housing production — “were an advertisement to the market that we’re open for business.”“When you make a big commitment into HPTF [the Housing Production Trust Fund] it makes the lenders, equity providers and investors pay attention,” Albert said.Colleen Green, director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, pointed to neighborhood planning efforts like zoning changes and working with the D.C. Housing Finance Agency to secure bond financing for affordable housing products.“Every aspect of affordable housing has been put on steroids in the District to meet this goal,” Green said. “The commitment that has been made here is bar none in the nation, and I think that’s really what it is.”Housing advocates have for years pushed for more urgency to address the affordable housing shortage. Census data has shown almost half of D.C. households are cost-burdened or severely cost-burdened — meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent — while a November Urban Institute report estimated 12 percent of D.C. residents, or more than 80,000, experience housing insecurity.As part of the goal to build 12,000 affordable units, officials set out to more equitably distribute new affordable housing across the District — especially in areas where, historically, exclusionary housing policies contributed to segregation.But data shows the District is woefully behind producing new affordable housing in some areas, such as Rock Creek West, while far exceeding its goals in others, like in the Far Southeast and Southwest, where lower-income residents are more concentrated. Rock Creek West has met only 11.6 percent of its 2025 affordable housing goal — raising the stakes for the city to garner neighborhood support for projects like the one at the Chevy Chase Library. Meanwhile, Far Southeast and Southwest have more than doubled its target goal; about half of the projects preserved affordable housing through new affordability covenants, like at Terrace Manor.Albert said part of the reason neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River have carried a greater share of the affordable housing goals is because much of the city’s affordable housing already existed there. But many residents have struggled with deteriorating or unlivable conditions in their buildings. In those cases, Albert said the city could invest in major renovation projects counting toward the goal, while both preserving the affordability of the buildings and making them more attractive to residents. That was largely the story of Terrace Manor.“There’s a combination of what existed in the past, where we’ve been putting huge amounts of money to make sure that continues to be a quality place for people to live,” Albert said. “But if you look at new, ground up construction, you’ll see it’s much more equitable” citywide.Housing officials on Monday also noted that, when reviewing applications from developers for Housing Production Trust Fund dollars, they would give greater weight to projects in planning areas that are lagging in their target goals.For some residents, like Ciara Williams, who introduced the mayor on Monday, the expansion of affordable housing in D.C. drastically changed her family’s quality of life.Williams, a 39-year-old mother of two, was homeless and living in a hotel between 2020 and 2022 when the father of her children was killed. In the city’s shelter system and with nowhere else to turn, a case worker helped her secure a permanent housing voucher to live at Spring Flats — a housing project announced by the city in 2020 with a majority of affordable units.Now, instead of a hotel room with two queen-size beds, Williams lives in a spacious apartment; her children, ages 13 and 9, have their own rooms.She called the opportunity a “blessing.”“I can actually let my hair down and not feel frustrated when I come in, not have to worry about strangers walking around my door,” she said. “My kids can have their own room and just relax and be themselves, and not have to worry about where we’re going to be tomorrow.”"
WaPo_101,"Once an awkward fit, skateboarding at the Olympics finally has a moment",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/29/jagger-eaton-nyjah-huston-street-skateboarding-paris-olympics/,2024-07-30 05:08:03.046249,,"PARIS — They had barely left the skateboard stadium Monday at Place de la Concorde, and Jagger Eaton, the only American to win two Olympic skateboarding medals, already was calling the Paris Olympics men’s street final here the greatest ever — in any competition, X Games, Dew Tour, Street League or World Cup.The tricks were that big. The drama that wrought. A gold medal that Eaton thought he had won by landing a trick that never had been completed in competition was gone in an instant when Japan’s Yuto Horigome dropped a bombshell of a leap on his board, spinning off a railing, to send Eaton to silver. And yet the day had been so magnificent, with fellow American Nyjah Huston winning bronze, that Eaton stood in the fading sunlight smiling wide.The Olympics “just brings the best out in us,” he said.When skateboarding first came to the Olympics at the Tokyo Games, most of the world’s top skaters did not embrace the development, viewing the Games as the ultimate mainstream contest and antithetical to their cultural ethos as outsiders. Eaton saw the possibilities first. As the child of gymnastics coaches, from a family of gymnasts, he knew the breadth of the Olympics audience made them different from anything else in sports.While the X Games stars slowly dragged their feet to the Games, Eaton leaped, embracing it fully. In many ways he is like snowboarder Shaun White, who capitalized on the Olympics to build an empire of medals and endorsements a generation before. Eaton, who lives and trains not far from White in San Diego, sees White as something of a mentor.Eatonhad prepared hard for these Games, vowing to compete in both street and park events. He almost made it happen, too, losing his chance at park in the last of a series of qualifiers the International Olympic Committee has created to inspire more interest in younger fans. “I’m just fortunate to have a family that loved the Olympic Games and when it got involved in skateboarding, it felt like my destiny because that was all I watched every summer,” he said standing in a corner of the plaza, not far from the park where the balloon with the Olympic flame is moored. “I was much more mentally equipped for what the Olympic Games entails because of how much pressure there was and how much my family understood it.”Eaton won bronze in Tokyo while Huston, who might be street skating’s biggest star ever with six world championships, 12 X-Games gold medals, close to 200 tattoos and a taste for expensive cars, did not. While Eaton thrived in Tokyo, Huston looked perplexed, struggling to seventh. On Monday, he said he could never adapt to the mix of a brighter spotlight and a lack of fans during a pandemic Games. What was supposed to be the biggest competition of his life felt like a practice day with the empty stands.This time, though, the eight skaters in Monday’s final seemed to grasp what Eaton had been saying for all these years. Huston moved through his runs and tricks with ease, Lesser known skaters such as Canada’s Cordano Russel took big chances and scored. But the day looked to be about Eaton and Huston. Back and forth they went, each matching the other. For a time, Eaton led, then Huston pulled ahead only to fall behind. On his fourth of five trick tries, Eaton completed a nollie 270 switch backside noseblunt on the railing, wobbling for a moment as he landed on his rolling board, but staying upright. He threw his hands in the air. Huston shook his head, then walked toward Eaton to shake his opponent’s hand.Then, minutes later, Horigome passed them both.“The roller coaster was that I thought I had won, then I got off the ride,” Eaton said.When it came time to get the medals, Eaton accepted his silver, smiling and waving, pointing toward family in the stands. Huston, 29, looked at his bronze almost with wonder, turning it in his hands, gazing at the engraving. The skater who has won more gold skateboarding medals than he could know what to do with was transfixed by Olympic bronze.“It’s sick to look at,” he said, while standing with Eaton in the back corner of the square. “I’ve gotten a ton of X-Games gold medals before but none of them look like this or feel like this.”He was still wearing his medal, and he lifted it again in the early evening light.“The main part that’s different is us representing our country,” he said. “To see how hyped all the crowd is and the fans for the USA obviously but also the other countries, that’s really a special thing and something that’s new to us as skateboarders but something that’s most special about this experience.”A few minutes earlier, as the stadium cleared, Eaton’s father Geoff stood near his seat in the stands, watching his son and Huston. Geoff Eaton always has loved skateboarding, and when his sons were young, he pushed them toward the skatepark and away from gymnastics. Something about the camaraderie of skateboarding made him think that was best for his kids.“I don’t think many people in the skateboarding community understood what it means to be on the world stage representing their country,” he said. “But they will.”On Monday, in what his son called the greatest street skateboarding final anywhere, it seemed that maybe they already did."
WaPo_102,D.C. region under drought watch as officials advise limiting water use,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/29/drought-watch-dc-maryland-virginia/,2024-07-30 06:21:02.710471,,"Six million residents across the region are being asked to be careful with their water use after the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments issued a drought watch on Monday.The guidance comes after a stretch of record-setting hot days that has created unusually dry conditions in Maryland, Virginia and the District, including low flow in the Potomac River.Officials remain adamant that region is prepared. The three water supply reservoirs in the region are full, and if needed water can be directed from these into the river basin. The water-saving measures suggested by local leaders on Monday — including taking five-minute showers; turning the faucet off when brushing your teeth; waiting to wash dishes and laundry until you have full loads — remain voluntary.“Our water supply infrastructure is well-equipped to handle drought,” Michael Nardolilli, the executive director of the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB), said in a news release. “Nevertheless, it makes sense for all of us to use water wisely and not waste this precious resource.”The current drought watch is the second level in a four-part assessment scale used by local leaders and water utilities, according to Lindsey Martin, a communications specialist with the with the Council of Governments.“If we reach ‘drought emergency,’ then the utilities would be looking to enact mandatory measures,” Martin said, referring to the scale’s highest level. The emergency level would be triggered if, based on the regional drought plan, there was a “50 percent probability” the region cannot “meet water supply demands over next month.”According to the Council of Governments, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared that local precipitation levels are nearly 4 inches below normal in the last 60 days.After a wet start to 2024, rain shut off abruptly this summer as temperatures soared to record highs. As the ground dried out rapidly, a “flash” drought overtook the D.C. area and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.The federal government’s drought monitor shows extreme drought — the second-highest category — covering much of northwest Virginia, including the Interstate 81 corridor, most of Loudoun County and parts of Fairfax and Prince William counties. The rest of the D.C. area is classified under moderate to severe drought, except for Southern Maryland, where recent rains have helped close the rainfall deficit.In early June, there was no drought in the region but minimal amounts of rain have fallen since. Only about 0.5 to 2 inches of rain have fallen, which is less than half the norm.The District posted its fourth-driest June on record with just 1.15 inches of rain.Somewhat more rain has fallen in July, but it has been hit-or-miss with the highest amounts east of Interstate 95 and minimal totals to the west.Both Dulles and Baltimore-Washington International Marshall airports have registered their second-driest summers on record to date.Through this week, downpours will continue to be hit-or-miss. The kind of widespread drenching needed to put a meaningful dent in the drought is not in the forecast.The National Weather Service, however, gently leans toward above-normal rainfall during August in the region."

WaPo_104,World leaders doubt Maduro’s victory claim in Venezuelan election,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/29/venezuela-presidential-election-result-maduro/,2024-07-30 06:55:02.710471,,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The United States and several Latin American countries cast doubt Monday on President Nicolás Maduro’s reelection on Sunday as opposition leaders collected what some said was evidence of a brazen electoral fraud.Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which Maduro controls, claimed early Monday that he earned 51 percent of the vote to Edmundo González’s 44 percent. Independent exit polling and partial results suggested González in fact won twice as many votes as Maduro.On Monday afternoon, council President Elvis Amoroso declared Maduro president for another six-year term — suggesting that a recount would not change the outcome announced earlier in the day.The Venezuelan opposition, which had seen the election as its best chance in years of defeating the authoritarian socialist, rejected those results. Opposition leaders demanded that Maduro hand over scanned printouts of all voting records — more than 30,000 documents — signed and dated by poll workers and opposition observers, and not just the numbers shown on the government webpage, to prove their claims.“The results are undeniable,” González said late Sunday. “The country elected a peaceful change.”Biden administration officials and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which sent a technical observation team to monitor Sunday’s vote, made similar calls.Opposition leaders, who organized, trained and sent thousands of ordinary citizens to polling places Sunday in anticipation of potential fraud, said records they had compiled from nearly 40 percent of the nation’s voting centers proved their victory.According to their information, opposition leader María Corina Machado said, Maduro’s win was “impossible.”“We won, and the whole world knows it,” she told reporters early Monday.If true, Maduro’s claims would mark uncharted territory even for a strongman who has been accused of manipulating or tampering with elections on the margins several times over the past decade. In previous elections, he’s been accused of coercion, manipulation and other tricks to tip the vote a few percentage points in his favor.Never before has he been accused of reversing a gap as large as the opposition is suggesting, according to electronic engineer Mario Torre, who’s auditing the electoral system for the opposition.“For the first time they dare to give a result that is not the one that the system reflects,” Torre said. “We’re talking about a massive fraud.”On Monday afternoon, voters across Venezuela poured into the streets, apparently of their own accord, and notably in working-class neighborhoods that have long been strongholds of support for Maduro and his late mentor, Hugo Chávez, to bang pots and pans and demand he step down.“We don’t agree with the fraud President Maduro committed,” said Marjory Rojas, a 40-year-old housekeeper from a working-class neighborhood in Baruta, who was protesting along a highway in Caracas. “I have three children living outside of the country, and he’s saying he won? We want him to leave. It’s not fair what they’re doing to the country.”U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Monday called on Maduro to publish “the full, detailed tabulation of votes.”“We’re going to withhold judgment until that time … and [then] we will respond accordingly,” he said.Two senior Biden administration officials said Maduro’s government has all the voting data now and could release it immediately. That data, one said, is “required under Venezuelan law and should be immediately providable.”The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the administration, said they had received ample information from multiple sources indicating that the results announced by the electoral council were  “at odds with how people actually voted … potentially substantially at odds.”The officials declined to detail possible next steps. One said the administration would “continue to assess our sanctions policy” in light of “the action or non-action” taken by the Maduro government and U.S. interests.But it was unlikely, one said, that the administration would cancel the licenses provided to Chevron and other oil companies allowing them to do business in Venezuela.Maduro has ruled Venezuela since the death of Chávez, founder of the socialist state, in 2013. Many here blame him for the oil-rich country’s economic collapse and the exodus of millions of citizens, including hundreds of thousands who have fled to the United States.Some Latin American countries, including Colombia and Brazil, which have friendly ties to Maduro, joined in the skepticism about the announced results, as did Spain, Italy and other European nations.Celso Amorim, a top foreign policy adviser to Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, one of Maduro’s most important leftist allies, was reserving judgment.Amorim was visiting the Miraflores presidential palace on Monday afternoon to meet with Maduro. He was also hoping to meet with González before reaching an assessment, according to a diplomatic official who was in Caracas with him.Russia, China, Iran and Cuba congratulated Maduro.In a memo, the opposition campaign declared the vote a “FRAUD” and said the “burden of proof” was on the government.“Months will go by and they will not be able to deliver it to us. That is what we have to achieve, demanded by us and by the international community,” the memo’s authors wrote.On Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the electoral data transmission system suffered an attempted “attack,” and he accused opposition leaders Lester Toledo and Leopoldo López of carrying it out to “manipulate the data.” He also accused Machado of being involved, providing no evidence.“What has happened in our country is a huge social movement that they will not stop,” said Machado, Venezuela’s most popular politician. “We are a civic peaceful movement, and that’s how we will keep working until we make the truth prevail — and it will prevail.”In the run-up to the election, Maduro’s government barred Machado from running, arrested campaign workers and denied the opposition access to state media. During voting on Sunday, there were reports of blocked entry, delays and violence at some voting centers.Maduro’s claims threatened to increase his and Venezuela’s isolation on the world stage. His Foreign Ministry said Monday it was withdrawing all of Venezuela’s diplomats from seven Latin American countries, including Argentina, Chile and Peru, and demanding those country’s governments do the same. (Maduro severed diplomatic relations with the United States in 2019.)He’s been down this road before. In 2018, he claimed reelection in a vote marred by charges of irregularities, prompting mass protests at home and condemnation abroad.The United States and other countries ultimately declared Maduro illegitimate and recognized then-National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader.In a statement early Monday, Maduro claimed without evidence that the electoral council had been hacked from an unnamed country, causing a delay in the publication of the full election results. “The demons and the devils did not want the total to be counted,” Maduro said.Latin American leaders across the political spectrum cast doubt on the results.Colombia’s foreign minister, Luis Gilberto Murillo, called for an independent verification and audit of the vote count “as soon as possible.”Left-of-center Chilean President Gabriel Boric described the official results as “difficult to believe” and demanded that independent international observers be given access to the full results. “From Chile, we will not recognize any result that is not verifiable,” he wrote on X early Monday.On the other end of the political spectrum, Argentine President Javier Milei, too, said he would not recognize a “fraud.” “Venezuelans chose to end the communist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro,” he posted on X, and he called on Venezuela’s armed forces to “defend democracy and the popular will.”Peruvian Foreign Minister Javier González-Olaechea accused Maduro’s regime of having the “intention of fraud” and recalled Peru’s ambassador to Venezuela for consultations. “Peru will not accept the violation of the popular will of the Venezuelan people,” he said on X.Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay also issued calls for a transparent count of the votes by independent observers.Meanwhile, Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia and Honduras — all allies of Maduro — congratulated him.The Russian ambassador to Caracas described the victory as “credible,” and President Vladimir Putin sent his best wishes. “Remember that you are always a welcome guest on Russian soil,” he told Maduro.China’s Foreign Ministry congratulated Maduro and Venezuela on their “successful” election. “China and Venezuela are good friends and partners who support each other,” Chinese state media quoted ministry spokesman Lin Jian saying at a news conference.Cuba’s Raúl Castro, the younger brother of the late Fidel Castro and a former premier of the communist island nation himself, called Maduro to congratulate him, Cuba’s Foreign Ministry said.Sands reported from London.

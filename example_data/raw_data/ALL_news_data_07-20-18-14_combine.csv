NBC_1,"Facing a tough re-election bid, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester calls on Biden to bow out",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democratic-sen-jon-tester-calls-joe-biden-drop-out-2024-election-rcna162644,2024-07-19 10:00:04.655348,,"Sen. Jon Tester of Montana became the second Democratic senator to call for President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race Thursday.
""While I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term,"" Tester said in a statement.
Tester is running for re-election to one of the most vulnerable Senate seats for Democrats this fall.
He said he has ""worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong.""
Tester informed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of his plans before he made a public statement, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Schumer told Tester to do what he thought was best.
Tester is only the second Democratic senator to call on Biden to bow out of the race, following Peter Welch of Vermont. 
Shortly after Tester's announcement, Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., also called on Biden to step aside.
""For the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started,"" Costa said, after praising Biden's presidency. ""Democrats need to unite and deliver their strongest team to the American people in this election.”
Costa, who has served in Congress since 2005, represents a district that includes Fresno. He won re-election in 2022 with 54.2% of the vote.
Including Tester and Costa, 22 congressional Democrats have now called on Biden to exit the race.
Tester's comments come after he said in a July 8 statement that Biden ""has got to prove to the American people — including me — that he’s up to the job for another four years."" 
Representing a red state, Tester has criticized Biden before, including over the timing of his border policies and his Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
Reached for comment, the Biden campaign pointed to remarks from Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Biden’s re-election campaign, who reacted to the news during an interview on MSNBC.
“I like Sen. Tester. I think he’s one of our great fighters in the Democratic Party,"" Richmond said. ""But on this, I will tell you, I think he’s wrong, and I think that we should be focused on re-electing the president and the vice president, and our senators and our Congress people should be running their race to get re-elected.""
""There’s a lifetime between now and Election Day, and if we focus on what we should, we’ll come out on top,"" Richmond continued.
The Biden campaign also pointed to earlier comments from Quentin Fulks, the principal deputy campaign manager, who said that Biden ""is not wavering on anything."" The president has said multiple times that he's staying in the race.
Tester's Republican challenger slammed him in a statement on X, asking whether Tester is ""finally admitting he lied when he told us Biden is 100% with it?!""
""Two-Faced Tester is desperately trying distance himself from the train wreck he’s enabled and forced on Montanans,"" said Tim Sheehy, who is running for Tester's seat.
Tester told NBC News in August that he believed Biden was ""absolutely 100% with it"" when he was asked whether he had any concerns about Biden's age.Megan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.

NBC_2,Airports fill with long lines and broken blue screens following cancellations and delays due to global IT outage,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/airports-fill-long-lines-broken-blue-screens-cancellations-delays-due-rcna162673,2024-07-19 21:00:02.915084,,"Airports devolved into scenes of chaos early Friday after ground stops were issued because of a massive IT outage felt across the globe. 
Long lines, crowded gates and agitated passengers became common scenes at major airports. At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles International Airport, monitors usually displaying flight departure times were replaced with malfunctioning blue screens.
More than 1,500 flights were delayed within, to or out of the United States as of 7:30 a.m., and almost 1,000 were canceled, according to FlightAware data. Globally, there have been almost 19,000 delays and more than 1,600 cancellations, according to the tracker.  
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, the biggest carriers in the U.S., all issued ground stops early Friday.
Delta said in a statement, “All Delta flights are paused as we work through a vendor technology issue,” and by 8 a.m. said it ""has resumed some flight departures."" Meanwhile, United said, “While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports.”
American said as of 5 a.m., “We have been able to safely re-establish our operation.”
The outage, affecting major businesses, police forces, public transport and banks, was caused by an information technology glitch due to an issue with the Microsoft cloud. Microsoft said shortly before 7 a.m. that the underlying cause was fixed, but “residual impact is continuing to affect some Microsoft 365 apps and services.” 
Microsoft said another issue is the “CrowdStrike Falcon agent,” a cybersecurity platform used by businesses globally that is separate from Microsoft. CrowdsStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz said the company is working with customers “impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” while noting, “this is not a security incident or cyberattack.” 
Airports also warned of flight delays and cancellations, including Tampa International Airport, Denver International Airport, and Belfast International Airport in Northern Ireland. 
The outage is now a test of patience for passengers as airports fill with extremely long lines. 
Colby Black, 45, took the delays at JFK Airport in stride, even though he wasn’t sure when his rescheduled flight to Los Angeles would take off.
“It says 8 a.m. on the board, but 9 a.m. on my app, so who knows,” he said of the flight, which was originally set to depart at 6 a.m.
“I’m just tired. I want to sleep,” said Black, who woke up at 3 a.m. “But otherwise, yeah, it happens ... There’s not much I can do about it. If I can’t affect it, why bother?”
Samantha C., 35, who was at JFK with her infant son said hadn't slept the night before.
“I’m still up, running on no sleep,” said the mother, who was seated at an airport barstool beside a heavy pour of chilled white wine. She wasn’t originally planning to order a preflight drink.
“Hell no. I got to the airport at 4 o'clock this morning,” she said. 
But her 7:05 a.m. flight to Florida was delayed three hours, causing major headaches for both her and the family members who were set to pick her up. 
In Paris, which sees a flurry of tourists this time of year and is expecting even more with the upcoming Olympics, the Paris Airport Authority which manages the 14 civil airports and airfields in the area, said Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Paris-Orly Airport were seeing slowdowns, delays and suspension of some flights. 
Porter Airlines of Canada said it was canceling all flights until 12 p.m. ET “due to a third-party systems outages affecting global industries.” KLM Royal Dutch Airlines of the Netherlands wrote on X, “KLM and other airlines and airports have been affected by a global computer outage, making flight handling impossible.”Breaking News Reporter

NBC_3,"Three years after Covid, worldwide IT outage again reveals fragility of global commerce, supply chains",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/worldwide-computer-outage-reveals-fragility-global-commerce-rcna162672,2024-07-19 22:07:02.891507,,"A failure in the interconnected web that constitutes the global supply chain threatens to disrupt daily commerce for an indefinite period, showing how widespread reliance on the same system can create a worldwide crisis when that system goes down.  
It was still not known Friday morning how long it would take to address the issue, which cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike attributed to an improperly executed update on Microsoft systems.
Although Microsoft itself was not directly responsible for the outage, the worldwide reliance on a single common operating system and a major cybersecurity company, while useful when everything is running smoothly, creates the potential for a single point of failure to take down the entire planet, experts say.
In addition to many major airlines being unable to clear flights for takeoff, everything from port authorities to train systems, alongside hospitals and banks, were affected.  
Wesley Miller, a research analyst and former Microsoft employee who writes about IT issues, said the outage shows the price of interconnectedness and the dangers of market concentration.
Not only was there an overreliance on Microsoft, he said, but Friday's outage could also be blamed on the consolidation of vendors in the cybersecurity space. Backed by Google and one of the most valuable cybersecurity firms in the world, CrowdStrike has made a number of strategic acquisitions in recent years. 
""At end of the day, everyone is operating with one thing, and they're trying to move faster than bad guys to avoid getting attacked,"" Miller told NBC News. 
Miller also placed some blame on the lingering staffing challenges created by Covid.
“Teams everywhere are really stretched thin; IT staff, testing staff, everyone is pulled to their max,” he said. “Everyone is still pretending everything is fine, when there’s been massive changes all around us.”  
Ironically, high-profile examples of companies not affected by the outage have previously faced their own issues because they weren't using state of the art technology. Notably, Southwest and Frontier airlines appeared to be the only large U.S. air carriers operating without incident Friday. Two years ago, Southwest's entire system shut down as a result of its reliance on an antiquated scheduling system. 
""This will happen and keep happening as long as everything is built around fragile supply chains where the same companies turn up time and time again,"" Jennifer Cobbe, assistant professor of law and technology at the University of Cambridge, posted on X Friday.  
""This means no resilience: One of them goes down, potentially everything goes down — with widespread and unforeseeable consequences.""
The speed at which companies must now move to compete with one another creates inherent instability, Miller said.   
""We're clearly operating faster than the systems we’ve built can handle,"" he said. ""We need to start taking a look at more failsafes.""
Miller is not optimistic they will be easily implemented. 
In the wake of the pandemic, there was a great amount of discussion about how to make global supply chains more resilient. In 2021, President Joe Biden held a Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience alongside European Union nations and 14 other countries. Last fall, the White House released a new Issue Brief on the topic, noting: ""Economic research has long been clear that deeply intertwined supply chains can turn micro disruptions into macro-level effects.""
The brief noted that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the Biden administration's CHIPS & Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act, were all designed to help boost supply-chain resiliency.
But Miller believes companies' requirements to maximize profits means the global commerce system will continue to be vulnerable indefinitely, he said.
""There’s so little shareholder value in taking a little extra time to do the right thing,"" he said. Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
NBC_4,What we know about the global Microsoft outage,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/microsoft-outage-crowdstrike-global-airlines-windows-fix-rcna162685,2024-07-19 22:00:02.891507,,"A routine software update caused cascading chaos Friday that has engulfed global businesses from airports and banks to retail and law enforcement.
It wasn’t a cyberattack, but was caused by one of the world’s largest cybersecurity companies deploying a flawed update while trying to keep their customers safe from hackers.
CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company based in Austin, Texas, that’s widely used by businesses and government agencies that run on Microsoft computers, said that a defect in one of its updates for computers running the Windows operating system had caused the issue. The result was arguably the largest global information technology outage in history. 
Here’s what we know:
The outage appeared to affect almost every major business sector in one way or another.
Airports and flights across the world were severely delayed or canceled altogether, as the computers on which these services rely were disrupted by the issue. Three of the largest airlines in the United States — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines — all issued ground stops, citing communications problems.
Long lines snaked through airports from Berlin to Hong Kong, as electronic systems failed and staff members resorted to checking in passengers manually. One flier in the Indian city of Hyderabad posted a picture of a curiosity usually unseen in the modern digital age: a handwritten boarding pass.The issue also affected banks, leaving some customers unable to access their money. People across Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere reported problems logging into their accounts at major retail banks. Meanwhile the London Stock Exchange, the largest of its kind in Europe, said some of its services had been disrupted although trading had not been impeded.
In retail, McDonald’s closed some of its stores in Japan because of what it said in an online statement was a “cash register malfunction.” And the British grocery chain Waitrose was forced to put up handwritten notes informing customers that it was only accepting cash.
Baltic Hub, a global shipping terminal in Poland, said in a statement it had been battling issues related to the outage. The Alaska State Troopers agency was among the law enforcement agencies to report issues, warning people that 911 was temporarily not working. And the British broadcaster Sky News, which is owned by NBCUniversal's parent company, Comcast, was briefly knocked off the air.Some computers that were not on during the software update appear to have avoided the issue, according to initial reports.
Cybersecurity programs like CrowdStrike’s frequently and automatically update themselves to account for new tactics that malicious hackers have discovered. And there’s always a slight risk that any software update will be incompatible with other programs.
CrowdStrike’s update should have been routine, but an error in its code conflicted with Windows and proved catastrophic.
The company’s CEO, George Kurtz, said Friday morning on the ""TODAY"" show that while some customers would see their computers fixed automatically, others would require manual work to fix.
“The system was sent an update, and that update had a software bug in it and caused an issue with the Microsoft operating system,” Kurtz said. “Our systems are always looking for the latest attacks from these adversaries that are out there.”
CrowdStrike identified the problem and issued a fix early Friday after the problem began to emerge.
The fix required affected computers to download another software update, which some have been able to do automatically.
Many companies and services affected by the chaos, such as the New Hampshire Department of Safety, which said its 911 system was briefly down, reported that they were back online by Friday morning. 
Others haven’t been able to load the update, which would potentially require IT workers at some companies to reboot and tinker with every single affected computer.
“Many of the customers are rebooting the system, and it’s coming up, and it’ll be operational because we fixed it on our end,” Kurtz said. “Some of the systems that aren’t recovering, we’re working with them. So it could be some time for some systems that just automatically won’t recover.”Alexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.

NBC_5,Biden's family starts discussing his possible exit plan from the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/bidens-family-starts-discussing-exit-plan-2024-race-rcna162658,2024-07-19 22:00:02.891507,,"WASHINGTON — Members of President Joe Biden’s family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, according to two people familiar with the discussions. 
The overall tone of the conversations has been that any exit plan — should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will — should put the party in the best position to beat former President Donald Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office, these people said. 
Biden’s family members have specifically discussed how he would want to end his re-election bid on his own timing and with a carefully calculated plan in place. Considerations about the impact of the campaign on his health, his family and the stability of the country are among those at the forefront of the discussions, the people familiar with those discussions said.
The prospect of Biden’s considering stepping aside, much less that his family is gaming out a possible exit plan, is an extraordinary development that comes after he has repeatedly said he would not relinquish his position as the presumptive nominee of the party. 
But concerns have mounted among party leaders, donors and even officials who are part of his re-election effort with every day that has passed since a devastating debate three weeks ago. At the same time, Democrats are watching Republicans rally around Trump, who just survived an assassination attempt and accepted his party’s nomination Thursday night. 
White House spokesman Andrew Bates denied that any such exit discussions are happening among the family. 
""That is not happening, period,"" he said. ""The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team — and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.""
On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon acknowledged that the campaign has seen some ""slippage,"" but she said it's been ""a small movement"" and insisted Biden is ""absolutely"" still in the race. 
Ron Klain, Biden’s former White House chief of staff and an adviser to him for decades, said in an interview that Biden is hearing the public and private calls for him to exit the race.
“I think he’s feeling the pressure,” said Klain, who has spoken to Biden recently. “I want him to stay in.”
Klain’s take is that it makes no sense for Biden to be pushed aside. He said some in his party underestimate Trump at their own peril and undervalue the fact that Biden is the only one who has beaten him.
Biden and the people closest to him have felt burned by efforts to push him out that they see as backhanded and disrespectful. The family is distraught and moving through the stages of anger and grief over how people they perceived to be friends have treated the president.
“There was a much more dignified way to do this if this is what they wanted,” a Biden ally said. “This is no way to treat a public servant who has done a lot for this country.”
Discussions about how to game out a fitting plan for Biden to step aside have also played out among senior staff members, not just the president’s family, according to a person close to the re-election effort. Bates also denied these discussions are happening. 
The family members Biden has relied on most include first lady Jill Biden, his son Hunter and his sister, Valerie Owens, as well as a few longtime close aides who have been at the core of the discussions.
The conversations about Biden’s political future have raged while he remains at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, sidelined after he tested positive for Covid on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, some of Biden’s closest aides were calling trusted allies to get a sense of where they thought his political standing is, according to a person familiar with the phone calls. 
A Democratic lawmaker described Biden in this moment as “reflective."" A third person close to Biden described the president as politically “fighting for his life.”
There are growing expectations among some allies that if Biden were to exit, it could be in the coming days. But they also caution that it still is up to him to make the decision and that he is not wired to quit even when he faces seemingly insurmountable adversity. 
About the possibility any announcement is imminent, a person close to the Bidens said, “We don’t even know what we’re doing tomorrow.”  
Still, Biden is not insusceptible to the mounting pressure from his own party, and he has said himself since the debate that he may consider leaving the race if there were no path for him to win. 
“I think it’s inevitable,” a second person close to the re-election effort said of Biden’s withdrawing from the race. 
As reports surfaced, including from NBC News, that Biden had shown signs that he could budge from his insistence that he remain the nominee, rumors and reports — some that the president's allies flatly denied — began to fly. They included speculation about timing of a potential exit, whether Biden would immediately endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and who was on the shortlist to be her vice presidential running mate.  
Among the reports: that longtime speechwriter and historian Jon Meacham was writing Biden’s exit remarks. 
Meacham rebuffed the account. 
“The report is totally false,” he said. 
Amid the turmoil the Biden campaign sent out talking points to Democrats, according to a Democratic strategist: “President Biden has not spoken to congressional leadership today. The president is his party’s nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He’s running for re-election, and that will not change until he wins re-election.” 
As many in his own party turned against him, Biden continued this week to check in with allies and gauge their sentiments. 
“With all the rumors that I’m leaving, I’m not,” Biden told the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader and MSNBC host, in a phone call Monday, Sharpton said.
“I will support whatever you decide,” Sharpton said he told the president.
Sharpton said in an interview Thursday that legacy is something Biden “has to think of” as he contemplates his political future. “If there’s anyone that could make a comeback … it’s Joe Biden. Whether he chooses to or not, I don’t know.”
Some in Biden’s camp had hoped he would be able to weather the storm of pressure for him to step aside — that news events, including the Republican National Convention, would turn the national conversation away from whether and when he might end his campaign. But even the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday did little to quell the furor around Biden. If anything, Democrats have since turned up the heat.
A major factor driving the private pressure on Biden is the fear among Democrats that his candidacy could rob them not only of the White House and the Senate but also of a chance to flip the House to their control. That helps explain why senior lawmakers have pushed on Biden to reconsider his decision to stay in the race.
“The House is on the brink,” said Brian Wolff, the treasurer of the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democratic candidates. “These candidates don’t deserve that.”
Wolff said Democratic incumbents and challengers in tough races cannot risk splintering their own voter coalitions by publicly taking one side or the other as Biden considers his options.
“They can’t afford to alienate the base that wants to support Biden or the base that wants someone else,” he said.Carol E. Lee is the Washington managing editor.

NBC_6,Jennie Garth shares the ‘90210’ group chat’s reaction to Shannen Doherty’s death,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/jennie-garth-shares-90210-group-chats-reaction-shannen-dohertys-death-rcna162709,2024-07-19 23:15:02.936129,,"Shannen Doherty’s former “Beverly Hills, 90210” co-stars are heartbroken over her tragic death by cancer at age 53.
Jennie Garth, who starred alongside Doherty on the series, opened up about the tight-knit cast’s reactions to Doherty’s death, which they shared on their group chat, on a tearful episode of her “I Choose Me with Jennie Garth“ podcast on July 18.
“Jason (Priestley), of course, was the first one to reach out to everybody and just, you know, say, ‘I love you guys, and this is insane,’” said Garth. “And no more loss.”
Doherty is the second of the core “90210“ cast members to die in recent years. Luke Perry died in 2019 at age 52 after suffering a massive stroke.
Garth said, with her voice breaking as she noted other “90210” family members who have passed away, such as actor Joe E. Tata, that she’s now haunted by a mental image of the show’s cast — which also included Tori Spelling, Brian Austin Green, Gabrielle Carteris and Ian Ziering — that depicts Doherty and Perry “fading away.”
“Like, it’s just, I can’t really wrap my head around it,” she said.
Garth mentioned the difficulty of grieving someone who is famous because there are “visual reminders” of the person everywhere. She mentioned how emotional it’s been for her to sign “90210” photos for fans in the five years since Perry’s death.
“It‘s really, really hard to sign cast photos and see Luke not there, and now to have to sign those photos without Shannen there, it’s just, like, inconceivable,” she said.
Garth added that Perry was the first person she thought of when she heard that Doherty had died. “I thought how happy he was going to be to be with her again,” she explained.
She added, “I just know — this is going to sound very weird — but he definitely was there to catch her.”
Garth said she was shocked by Doherty’s death, which came nearly a decade after the actor was first diagnosed with breast cancer.
“It’s crazy because we all knew she was sick. The whole world knew that, and I don’t know why, but I just thought she would get better. I thought she would kick it,” she said. “She’s the strongest woman around and I just never thought that this would happen.”
Garth mentioned that Doherty sounded “hopeful” about a cancer treatment on a recent podcast.
“I could tell she was feeling nervous, but I also saw glimmer of hope in her, and that just reassured me that everything was going to be OK,” she said.
“If she was hopeful, then I could be hopeful too,” she added.
Garth said she would always remember Doherty for her strength, bravery and generosity.
“I will remember the respect that I have for her, always had for her in her willingness to voice her opinions on things, stand up for people that needed to be stood up for that couldn’t do it themselves,” she said.
“Shannen was a fighter,” added Garth.
Days earlier, Garth honored Doherty in a tribute on Instagram, writing, “She was courageous, passionate, determined and very loving and generous. I will miss her and will always honor her deeply in my heart and in my memories.”"
NBC_7,How the Secret Service protects presidents — and what went wrong at the Trump rally,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-rally-shooting-missteps-rcna162278,2024-07-19 23:11:02.936129,,"It typically starts with a meeting with campaign staffers and usually ends without incident — a presidential candidate striding off stage and being whisked to the next stop on the campaign trail.
But the U.S. Secret Service’s advance planning for what outwardly seems like a routine political event is actually an intricate, multilayered process. It typically involves several specialized and senior agents strategizing, assessing and approving a detailed protection mission behind the scenes for days ahead of time, according to five former agents and one current one who have been directly involved in such planning.
For an outdoor campaign event, a comprehensive security plan put into place by the agency generally runs smoothly, said the former agents, some of whom spoke anonymously to discuss security practices. 
But last Saturday’s campaign rally that turned deadly in Butler Township, Pennsylvania — with multiple shots fired at former President Donald Trump and into a crowd, killing one man and critically wounding two others — underscores what can go wrong despite that detailed planning, the ex-agents said.
“There is no such thing as 100% security,” said Paul Eckloff, who served as a Secret Service agent for 22 years, including on details protecting Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump. “There will be vulnerabilities. You try to mitigate those as much as you possibly can. You monitor the things you can, and you plan for contingencies.”
Here’s how the Secret Service typically plans security for presidential candidate campaign events — along with the evident breakdowns in the plan at the Trump rally, according to the former agents.  
Planning usually begins with the Secret Service sending an advance team to scout the venue and meet with the candidate’s staff three to five days before an event, the former agents said. The advance team typically consists of a mix of agents with assigned tasks, including a designated lead and site agent, as well as special operations and technical agents, said Anthony Cangelosi, a former agent-turned-criminal justice college lecturer who was assigned to security details on several stops during Democrat John Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004. 
Among other tasks, the advance team assesses the site for potential “vulnerabilities” and identifies the “assets” — meaning agents and equipment — needed to provide security, he said. The team also identifies where to stage a command post and where within the venue to assign agents, Cangelosi said.
The advance team designates the venue’s security perimeters, or zones, and assigns agents and supporting law enforcement personnel accordingly, he said. The inner perimeter is closest to the candidate or “protectee”; the middle perimeter, within the venue but farther away, is next; and then the outer perimeter.
The building the gunman scaled on Saturday was outside the inner security perimeter, though it was only about 148 yards from where Trump was speaking and well within range of the gunman’s rifle.
The building, owned by a glass research company, was noted as a “point of interest” in two advance security meetings, Butler Township’s manager said. Two people familiar with the planning told NBC News that the building was identified by the Secret Service as a vulnerability that required specific attention. 
The Secret Service typically assigns the more senior agents in a candidate’s personal detail  — or “shift” agents, as they’re called — to posts within the inner perimeter. The middle perimeter is often manned by agents who are pulled from local Secret Service field offices and assigned as “post-standers” responsible for securing specific and targeted areas, Cangelosi said.
The federal agency typically relies on local law enforcement officers, called “counterparts,” to assist with event security by assigning them to posts on the outer perimeter, the agents said.
Because of the Secret Service’s “limited resources and manpower, they have to rely on local counterparts to fulfill some of those outer perimeter posts,” said Michael Matranga, an agent for 12 years who served on several protective details safeguarding Obama.
A Secret Service spokesman has said that the agency designated the building the gunman used as being under the jurisdiction of local law enforcement, but a full picture has yet to emerge as to how the shooter was allowed to climb atop it to fire at Trump.
Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told ABC News that local police were inside the building when the gunman scaled it, but a Secret Service official later told NBC News that a local SWAT team was inside another building in the same complex.
A former Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that even if there weren’t enough people to cover the building, there were alternatives — such as putting a bus or tarp in front of the building to block the line of sight to where Trump was speaking.  
“It’s true there are finite assets, but you work within that,” the former official said. “Change the location of the rally, cover or block the roof, etc. This is just textbook.” 
Once threat assessments, venue vulnerabilities and agent assignments are drafted, the plan is shared with senior agents, each of whom can offer input and ask for changes before signing off, the agents said. Special operations and technical agents, such as the lead countersniper, separately draft their own plans for the event.
“They will have a countersniper advance, where a survey is done with plotting, mapping, pictures, quadrants, lines of sight, angles and lines of fire delineated,” Eckloff said.
Each countersniper is outfitted with rifles custom-built for them by the Secret Service, Eckloff said. Referred to as JARs — short for “just another rifle” — the weapons are “zeroed,” or set to ensure the accuracy of the sight, up to a day beforehand and can “neutralize a threat from as far as 1,000 yards away” — roughly the distance from the roof of the White House to base of the Washington Monument, he said.
A countersniper agent assigned to a campaign event typically is paired with another agent from the local field office who leads a “countersniper response team” tasked with checking out real-time issues that crop up during the event, Matranga said. If a countersniper assesses an immediate threat to life or bodily injury during the event, that agent can shoot to kill, he added.
“The policy at the Secret Service is we do not have a 'green-light system' where they need to seek authority,” Matranga said. “They do not need anybody’s permission to neutralize someone.”
But Cangelosi added that a countersniper likely won’t shoot unless they see a weapon, which might not readily be visible.
“If there’s no immediate threat, you’re not going to take a shot,” he said.
Cheatle released a statement after the shooting praising the countersniper team’s response. 
“Secret Service personnel on the ground moved quickly during the incident,” she said, “with our counter sniper team neutralizing the shooter and our agents implementing protective measures to ensure the safety of former president Donald Trump.” 
In the hours or days before the event, senior agents conduct three to four walk-throughs of the venue to assess the security plan, with the lead agent, the site agent, the field office supervisor and the candidate’s detail supervisor all given an opportunity to review the protective strategy and call for changes, Matranga said. Several team briefings and one-on-one discussions also are held, with supervisors quizzing post-standers and local counterparts to ensure each clearly understands their objectives and areas of responsibility, the former agents said.
Post-standers are agents deployed to their posts at least several hours before an event begins and before a bomb squad sweep of the venue, the agents said.
“Once an individual is posted, they have to maintain the integrity of that sweep,” said Matranga, who owns and runs a Texas-based security firm, M6 Global Defense. “If you walk off that post, you’ve now compromised the entire site, because that sweep has already been conducted.”
As soon as screening posts with metal detectors are opened to the public — typically several hours before an event begins — “it’s game time,” Eckloff said.
Planners typically designate a communications hub at each event site where supervisors field real-time reports over radio that can be immediately shared across multiple law enforcement radio frequencies as necessary. 
On Saturday, the gunman was photographed as a suspicious person more than an hour before he opened fire, and the Secret Service was notified about 10 minutes before Trump took the stage, three sources familiar with a Senate briefing on Wednesday told NBC News. The details of the real-time communications between law-enforcement agencies aren’t yet known. 
Every event gets its own confidential security plan shared only as needed, to make sure it doesn’t get out, Cangelosi said. Even if the same venue is used again during the campaign, the Secret Service plans security for each event from scratch, the agents said.
Breakdowns in security plans typically occur when someone “fails to execute their duties and responsibilities, or what we could call a weak link,” Cangelosi said. “When the chain is broken, it could be minor, it could be catastrophic.”
The attempt on Trump’s life has led to strong criticism of the Secret Service by law enforcement experts and politicians. It also set off a wave of finger-pointing across law enforcement agencies as to who was responsible for securing the building the gunman used. 
The Secret Service initially blamed local authorities, without naming specific agencies. Officials in Butler Township have since pushed back, crediting their police officers who were assigned to traffic control with racing to confront the gunman first, and the Secret Service has praised the officers who “ran towards danger.” 
One former agent who asked not to be named said the Secret Service “is always in charge” at such events “no matter what anyone says.”
“They make the plan,” the agent said. “Locals need to follow it, but it’s up to [the Secret Service] in every way to make sure that happens.”
Another agent still active with the Secret Service described security at such events as more of a “partnership,” but agreed responsibility for the plan is ultimately the agency’s.
The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Cheatle to testify at a hearing next week as part of an investigation into the assassination attempt. The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General also announced this week that it is reviewing “the process implemented” by the Secret Service to secure the  event. 
While no plan is perfect, Eckloff said the Secret Service’s advance planning techniques for campaign events represent a “flexible and adaptive mission model” that quickly incorporates lessons learned from events that go wrong.
In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Cheatle committed to making changes to Secret Service policies if needed based on an internal review. 
Eckloff predicts that the failures at the Trump rally will lead to “a historical sea change” in terms of how security is done going forward.
“I do think you’ll see a huge effect,” said Eckloff, who surmised that immediate changes with the Secret Service’s security at campaign events are likely to include extended security perimeters and more manpower.
“They’re certainly not going to wait for the outcome of a congressional inquiry to make adjustments,” he said.Lewis Kamb is a national FOIA reporter for NBC News, based in Seattle.

NBC_8,Red Lobster dishwasher rescues ‘one-in-30 million’ orange lobster,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/red-lobster-dishwasher-rescues-one-30-million-orange-lobster-rcna162704,2024-07-19 23:04:02.936129,,"A Red Lobster in Colorado has spared the life of a rare lobster it found by handing it off to a local aquarium.
After a dishwasher named Jose Romero at a Red Lobster in Pueblo, Colorado, discovered a rare orange lobster while unpacking a shipment Friday, July 12, the staff named the crustacean “Crush” in honor of the Denver Bronco’s legendary Orange Crush defense, read a press release obtained by TODAY.com.
“The first thought that went through his head was that he’s seen a blue lobster before, which was different, but he’s never seen an orange one,” Romero, who has worked at the Pueblo Red Lobster for 12 years, told the Pueblo Chieftain.
Staffers have since found Crush a new home at Denver’s Downtown Aquarium, the release said. Crush moved in July 17, the release added.
Ryan Herman, general curator at Denver’s Downtown Aquarium, said in the release, “We are thrilled to be able to share this very rare and extraordinary animal with the community and visitors to Colorado.”
Orange lobsters are one in 30 million, the release added. Its color stems “from a genetic mutation,” which “affects and prevents encoded proteins,” said the aquarium. Without one or several proteins, lobsters can be different colors, such as blue, yellow and orange.
Red Lobster workers have stumbled across several uniquely colored lobsters in recent years and have relocated them to various places.
In 2020, a worker in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, found Clawdia the crustacean and sent the blue lobster to a zoo in Akron, Ohio.
In July 2022, staffers at a Hollywood, Florida, location found an orange lobster, affectionally named Cheddar, and placed it in Ripley’s Aquarium of Myrtle Beach, Yahoo reported.
About a month later, in August 2022, workers at a Meridian, Mississippi, location came across another orange lobster, named it Biscuit and arranged its placement at Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies in Gatlinburg, Tennesee, Yahoo reported.
Before Crush, Denver’s Downtown Aquarium only had one orange lobster in its collection, the press release said. Upon completing a 30-day quarantine period and a veterinarian’s examination, Crush will live in the Lurks exhibit."
NBC_9,Microsoft's ‘Blue Screen of Death’ makes a return to computers around the world,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/microsoft-blue-screen-of-death-global-outage-rcna162674,2024-07-19 23:00:02.936129,,"An image that has instilled panic in computer users for decades popped up on screens worldwide Friday: the dreaded “Blue Screen of Death.”
Appearing everywhere from Macy’s flagship store in New York City to airports in India, the Blue Screen of Death has long prompted groans and frantic questions of “Did my work save?” It’s a Microsoft Windows error screen indicative of a system crash — meaning a computer issue has resulted in the operating system no longer being able to run safely.
An unwanted sight that has become so widely known over its more than 30-year existence, it’s sometimes referred to by its acronym, BSoD. On Friday, the blue screen taunted millions globally amid a widespread technology outage that halted flights, knocked broadcasters off the air and disconnected some emergency phone lines. Texas-based cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said early Friday that the outage was the result of a “defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” not a cyberattack, and that a fix had been deployed.Retired Microsoft software engineer David Plummer said that while the BSoD has always been synonymous with tech trouble on individual computers, “to have everybody having a blue screen at once is very uncommon.” He added that it’s not always something complex that leads to a blue screen, but “it has to be a failure in a place where the system has no other alternatives.”
The Blue Screen of Death has evolved over the years from a rudimentary message to today’s display, which remains simple enough to immediately inform whoever is looking at it that they’re in for some technological hassles. The blueness of the screen has also changed: Once a royal blue, the background color has morphed to cerulean. Some past operating systems, such as Windows 95 and 98, allowed users to customize the screen away from blue altogether for those who wanted to associate another color with misery.
Mar Hicks, a historian of technology and an associate professor at the University of Virginia's School of Data Science, said the Blue Screen of Death has become a cultural icon that strikes terror in nearly every computer user.
""Pretty much anybody, regardless of their level of computer savviness, knows that when you see that traditional old-school Blue Screen of Death, something has gone very badly wrong,"" Hicks said.
Despite its ubiquity, much is unknown about the origins of the Blue Screen of Death. Even its original creator is somewhat elusive: After it was widely credited in September 2014 to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in publications including Business Insider, Gizmodo and Engadget, another former Microsoft employee, Raymond Chen, claimed that he had been the one to create the original blue screen. Plummer said he thought it was former Microsoft developer John Vert, who has taken ownership credit for the blue screen in a post on the crowdsourcing site Quora, writing that he wrote the original code for Window NT 3.1 (the “NT” stood for “new technology”) in 1991. Vert did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Part of the confusion, according to Plummer, could be that a similar screen preceded the Windows NT Blue Screen of Death.
“There was a blue screen in the Windows of the older days of the ‘80s,” he said. “The one that we are hitting today just happens to be the same color in the same situation, but it’s a different scenario.”
CrowdStrike CEO and co-founder George Kurtz told NBC’s “TODAY” show on Friday that the company was “deeply sorry” to those impacted.
But the problem clearly wasn’t something that Control+Alt+Delete could quickly resolve: Kurtz warned that although a fix had been deployed, “it could be some time” before all systems are back up and running.Elizabeth Chuck is a reporter for NBC News who focuses on health and mental health, particularly issues that affect women and children."
NBC_10,"Israeli settlements violate international law, U.N.'s top court says in a landmark opinion",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/icj-united-nations-israel-settlement-violate-international-law-rcna162667,2024-07-19 23:38:02.936129,,"Policies and practices used by Israel in its occupation of Palestinian territories are in breach of international law, the United Nations' top court said in a landmark opinion Friday.
The International Court of Justice said in its opinion, which was read out by Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the world body, that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as ""the regime associated with them"" were established and are being maintained in violation of international law. 
The ICJ said Israel should cease all new settlement activities and evacuate settlers from Palestinian territories. 
It further said that Israel systematically discriminated against Palestinians and branded the occupation of the territories as ""de facto annexation,"" and that Israel's exploitation of natural resources in the Palestinian territories likewise violate international law. 
Its “unlawful policies and practices” were “in breach of the Israeli government's obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” the court said. 
The International Court of Justice, which is based at The Hague in the Netherlands, had been looking into the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories following a request from the United Nations General Assembly.
The General Assembly had asked the court in January 2023, prior to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, to deliver an opinion on Israeli ""policies and practices"" toward Palestinians and on the legal status of the occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.
In a statement on Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the ICJ's decision as “false,” saying that “The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,” referring to Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Benny Gantz, a more moderate Israeli politician and a former member of the war Cabinet, said the opinion “harms security and stability in the region,” and that Israel “will continue to defend ourselves against those who seek to destroy us.”
By contrast, the Palestinian Authority’s foreign affairs ministry called the opinion “a watershed moment,” adding that the ruling meant that the “international community is under an obligation not just to reaffirm the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination but to see to it that this right is implemented immediately.”
Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative and a veteran Palestinian political activist, welcomed the ICJ’s opinion as a “great victory for the Palestinian people and a major blow to Israel.”
“No more excuses. The international community must force Israel to end the occupation,” B’Tselem, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization that documents human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement Friday.
The court's advisory opinion is not legally binding, but it could have a significant political impact as Israel faces mounting backlash and isolation over its deadly military offensive in Gaza, where nearly 39,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials. 
It also comes just a day after Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite growing pressure from the global community, including from the United States, which has for decades officially supported the idea of a two-state solution.
The ICJ's opinion Friday is separate from another ongoing case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in its offensive in Gaza, an accusation both the U.S. and Israel have denied.  
The General Assembly had asked the ICJ to weigh in on the ""legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.""
It also asked the court to give its opinion on how the policies and practice of Israel affected the ""legal status of the occupation"" and what the legal consequences might be ""for all States and the United Nations."" 
Israel occupied the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during the Six-Day War. In 2005, faced with international and domestic pressure, Israel withdrew troops and thousands of Israeli settlers from Gaza, leaving the enclave to be governed by the Palestinian Authority while continuing its occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem. 
In 2006, Hamas was elected into power, replacing the Palestinian Authority as Gaza's governing body. In response, Israel significantly tightened its control over Gaza’s borders, coastline and airspace, imposing a blockade that, for 17 years, has crippled Gaza's economy, with a widespread, devastating impact on Palestinian civilians' daily lives. Israel says that the blockade is required to ensure the safety of its population from Hamas.
Across the West Bank, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have built sweeping settlements, many of which have displaced Palestinian communities. The international community largely considers these settlements to be illegal. 
In March, Israel also approved the appropriation of nearly 5 square miles of land in the Jordan Valley, in the largest seizure of land in the West Bank in decades. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the move “a step in the wrong direction,"" adding: “The direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.”
Meanwhile, Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, where the city's most sensitive holy sites are based, is not internationally recognized.
As an occupying power, Israel’s actions in the territories are expected to comply with rules under international law that govern occupation. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussions at the ICJ. He decried the case as part of a “Palestinian attempt to dictate the results” of a political agreement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without negotiations.Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London."
NBC_11,"Oil tankers on fire after colliding close to Singapore, crew rescued",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/oil-tankers-fire-collision-singapore-rcna162732,2024-07-20 00:21:02.914952,,"SINGAPORE — Two large oil tankers were on fire on Friday after colliding near Singapore, the world’s biggest refuelling port, with two crew members airlifted to hospital and others rescued from life rafts, authorities and one of the tanker owners said.
Singapore is Asia’s biggest oil trading hub and the world’s largest bunkering port. Its surrounding waters are vital trade waterways between Asia and Europe and the Middle East and among the busiest global sea lanes.
The Singapore-flagged tanker Hafnia Nile and the Sao Tome and Principe-flagged tanker Ceres I were about 55 km (34 miles) northeast of the Singaporean island of Pedra Branca on the eastern approach to the Singapore Straits, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said.
The 22 crew of the Hafnia Nile and the 40 on the Ceres I were all accounted for, the MPA said, which was alerted to the fire at 6:15 a.m. (2215 GMT)
The owner of Hafnia Nile confirmed the vessel was involved in a collision with Chinese owned Ceres I.
Photographs released by the Singapore Navy showed thick black smoke billowing from one tanker and crew being rescued from life rafts and flown to hospital.
The environmental authorities in neighbouring Malaysia said they had been told to prepare for potential oil spills.
Norway’s Gard, one of Hafnia Nile’s insurers, told Reuters it was too early to assess the environmental impact.
“We are supporting our member as they are dealing with the incident,” Gard said.
Navigational traffic had not been affected, although the status of the vessels or any pollution was unknown at present, a spokesperson at the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) said.
“No aerial surveillance has been conducted so far,” the spokesperson said.
“Salvage and fire-fighting assets have been arranged by both vessel owners to support the fire-fighting efforts and subsequent towage of the vessels to safety.”
The IMO spokesperson said a salvage team had been appointed and was en route to the area.
The 74,000 deadweight-tons capacity panamax tanker Hafnia Nile was carrying about 300,000 barrels of naphtha, according to ship-tracking data from Kpler and LSEG.
The Ceres I is a very large crude carrier supertanker, which ship-tracking data last showed was carrying around 2 million barrels of Iranian crude.
“The Ceres I has been a boat that has gone dark many times over the years,” said Matt Stanley, head of market engagement EMEA & APAC with Kpler, referring to when vessels switch off their AIS tracking transponders.
Stanley said the last AIS signal the vessel transmitted around March indicated it was carrying Iranian crude, which the U.S. has tried to curtail, including imposing sanctions on ports, vessels and refineries involved in the trade.
“She was at anchorage (on Friday). We can be fairly sure that she was carrying Iranian crude and was going to China,” Stanley said.
S&P Global said in an April report that China buys around 90% of Iran’s crude exports, often at discounted prices.
The Ceres I has not moved since July 11, according to LSEG shipping data.
The area Ceres I is anchored in is known to be used by so-called dark fleet ships for the transfer of Iranian oil in contravention of U.S. sanctions, said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, principal analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence.
“The Ceres I has repeatedly been involved in transferring or shipping Iranian oil in breach of U.S. sanctions,” she said.
Shipping sources have said the tanker was also involved in transporting Venezuelan oil, which is also under U.S. sanctions, to China in recent years.
The China-based owner of the Ceres I could not immediately be reached for comment. China has repeatedly said it is opposed to unilateral sanctions.
Up to 850 oil tankers are estimated to operate the shadow fleet transporting oil from countries such as Iran and Venezuela as well as Russia, which has multiple restrictions on its oil exports.
Shipping industry officials have warned that safety issues are growing because of the ageing and unregulated vessels.
The Ceres I vessel was built in 2001 while the Hafnia Nile was built in 2017, shipping data showed. It was unclear who provided insurance for the Ceres I, which was not covered by top tier providers like Gard, according to other data.Reuters"

She was 78.
Cheng, who had been diagnosed with a rare illness with symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, passed away Wednesday at home surrounded by her loved ones, her family wrote on Facebook. They said current medical treatment could not slow the progression of the disease, called neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism syndrome, and that she had donated her brain for medical research.
“Our mom wanted to be remembered by how she was: the legendary Queen of Martial Arts ... a versatile, award-winning actress whose film and television career spanned over six decades, not only in Asia but internationally as well,” they said.
Cheng loved being an actor and knew how fortunate she was to have the career she had, they said.
The entertainment publication Variety reported that she died in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The Shanghai-born film star became a household name in Hong Kong, once dubbed the Hollywood of the Far East, for her performances in martial arts movies in the 1960s. One of her most famous films was “Come Drink with Me,” directed by King Hu and released in 1966.
She played Jade Fox, who uses poisoned needles, in “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” which also starred famed Hong Kong actor Chow Yun-fat and Oscar-winning Michelle Yeoh. The movie, released in 2000, grossed $128.1 million in North America and won four Oscars.
More recently, Cheng performed in Disney’s “Mulan,” released in 2020.
She is survived by her three daughters and a son.
Supreme Art Entertainment, the company she worked for, expressed deep sorrow over her death.
“Besides her relentless efforts in her career, Sister Pei-pei was also an approachable, kind, helpful, and patient mother. Sister Pei-pei, we will always miss you!” it said on Facebook."

Teagan Brown, a weekend sports anchor and reporter at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, NBC affiliate WMBF, shared the clip on July 17 to her X page.
In her post, she explained that while her producer told her she was “clear” following her live hit on the beach, meaning she was no longer on-air, that was definitely not the case.
Viewers saw an animated transition to the next broadcast story but instead of showing the anchors in the studio, the screen came back out to Brown’s live shot without her knowing.
“Thank you!” she says, twirling the mic in the air and walking off camera.
As of the evening of July 18, the video has millions of views and nearly 53,000 likes. Brown jokes that she’s thankful nothing worse happened when she thought she was no longer on TV.
“People were commenting, saying, ‘At least I didn’t pull an ‘Anchorman,’” she laughs in an interview with TODAY.com.
Brown — a recent graduate of Syracuse in her first post-college gig — says that after her segments on-air, she usually does something little, like the mic twirl, to “get the energy out.”
“‘I’ll just do what I usually do, toss my mic in the air. Or sometimes I’ll spin, or, I don’t know, toss my mic,” she says. “It’s just getting the energy out after I just went on live TV and everything.”
She added that immediately after the hit, no one from her workplace thought to tell her about the incident.
“I had no idea that happened on live TV. They didn’t tell me afterward, like the director and or my producer in my ear weren’t like, ‘Oh, by the way, Teagan, everybody just saw that,’ so I had no idea,” she laughs, noting that hours later, a digital producer finally mentioned it to her.
Brown says she’s a “big fan” of sharing her blooper reels online and this is “definitely not the first time” something’s gone awry during one of her segments.
“Honestly, a lot of the comments are people making gifs, just saying things like ‘Me rolling out of the office on Friday’ or ‘On the way to the weekend,’” she says.
She said others have asked her if she used to be a baton twirler.
“Did I do one year of color guard? Yes, yes I did,” she quips.
She adds that there hasn’t been any negative backlash to the incident that she’s seen.
“At the end of the day, reporters are people. People in the control room, they’re people, we make mistakes,” she says. “But sometimes the mistakes are fun and why not post them on Twitter (X) for the world to see?”"

Hospital staffers in New York and Boston said they were unable to access some medical records or were having trouble figuring out where to send critically ill patients as several operating rooms had been shut down. 
“Every day, we have a plan that’s mapped out really carefully so that we can plan our resources,” said one employee of an affected New York City hospital system. “That’s all blown up,” the staffer said, asking to not be identified because the person wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the health care system.
“The whole hospital is down,” said an employee at Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston. “They asked patients to stay home today until further notice, and we can’t access virtual visits either.”
Dana-Farber is part of the larger Mass General Brigham hospital system, which tweeted that “due to the severity” of the outage, it was canceling any surgeries, procedures and medical visits that were not emergencies.
The Dana-Farber employee said that staff scheduled for today were instructed to report for duty but were unable to access patient medical records.

“They said they identified a fix but they have to go to every computer in the hospital individually to implement the fix,” the employee said.
The health care sector is no stranger to massive computer outages. 
American hospitals and other medical facilities have been under almost constant cyber attacks in the last several years from ransomware hackers, often based in Russia, who seek to lock up a victim company’s computers and demand a bitcoin payment for a code to potentially make them work again. Hospitals hit with ransomware often quickly pivot to offline solutions to help patients, such as writing patient notes and prescriptions by hand.
Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike has said the latest problem was not an attack, but rather the result of a routine software update accidentally introducing a devastating bug into Windows computers.
The problems Friday extended well beyond Boston. 
A message on New York City’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s website said “systems issues” prompted the facility to “pause the start of any procedure that requires anesthesia.”
The University of Miami Health System warned patients to anticipate delays while its IT teams worked to get computers back online. Until then, facilities going old school — “using paper orders to disseminate information,” the hospital said in a statement on Facebook. 
A letter to employees at Northwell Health in New York sent just before 9 a.m. ET said the hospital system was also experiencing problems associated with the outage. 
“Given the widespread nature of the impact, we have activated our system emergency operations center to coordinate our response,”  the Northwell leadership wrote.  
Duke University Health System in Durham, North Carolina, said that “essential computer functions in our hospitals and clinics have been affected,” but added that clinics remained open.
But other hospitals were either totally unaffected or appeared to experience only minor blips in service.
In a statement, Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta said that despite “interruptions overnight,” it had not experienced any significant impact on patient care.
The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus said in a statement that while it had some technology issues, “This is our current status: All of our facilities are open.”Erika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and ""TODAY.""

NBC_15,Protesters made a tiny footprint at the RNC in Milwaukee,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/protesters-rnc-milwaukee-rcna162253,2024-07-20 01:06:02.809574,,"MILWAUKEE — As Donald Trump entered the Fiserv Forum on Monday, the first night of the Republican National Convention, thousands of delegates and GOP faithful stood and raucously cheered.
Five blocks south, at Zeidler Union Square Park — one of two so-called First Amendment zones that city and U.S. Secret Service officials had designated for protests this week — there was no sign of a convention going on at all. 
At the precise moment Trump appeared inside the arena, there were exactly zero people in either Zeidler or the other designated zone — Haymarket Square, one block north of the convention.
That those zones — as well the entire downtown area outside the hard perimeter where people were allowed to pass through and congregate — were utterly barren, despite what progressives have said is a groundswell of opposition to the former president, underscores one the biggest surprises of the week: There was very little protest activity during the GOP’s four-day nominating convention in the crucial battleground state of Wisconsin.
“I am very disappointed,” said Omar Flores, the lead organizer for the Coalition to March on the RNC, the only large leftist protest to have taken place in Milwaukee during the RNC.
That two-hour protest went off without a hitch during the day Monday, before the convention officially opened.
But attendance at the rally — organizers say 3,000 people turned out; Milwaukee police estimate 700 to 800 — was far short of organizers’ expectations, despite their pouring all their energy into it. More notably, perhaps, there were no substantial protests in the days that followed.Milwaukee police had braced for a week of conflict and protest, bringing in more than 4,000 officers from more than 100 outside state and local departments to reinforce its ranks.
But it never materialized. A few small groups of protesters and counterprotesters screamed at one another outside a main security entrance to Fiserv on Wednesday, and on Thursday, a group of about 100 people protesting police brutality marched peacefully for five blocks and back. As of Thursday afternoon, only 12 people had been arrested in the convention area, according to the Milwaukee Police Department, mostly for disorderly conduct.
Progressive organizers in Milwaukee and elsewhere said there were a number of likely reasons for the lack of demonstrations. They said protesters, both locally and across the U.S., were saving their energy for next month’s Democratic National Convention, 90 miles south in Chicago, where some of their preferred causes, like ending the war in Israel, have a more appropriate audience in an incumbent administration. They also said some potential participants in Milwaukee had worried about the open-carry laws in Wisconsin, where it is legal to carry a gun in public without a permit, and criticized city officials for releasing security plans and protest zone details too late for most groups to adequately organize. 
“I think it’s all based on the fact that the vast majority of the mass social justice movements in this country are focusing on the DNC,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, the national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network and one of the lead organizers behind the main protest effort in Chicago, called the Coalition to March on the DNC.“That focus really is on the Democrats and on Joe Biden, and I believe it’s because of the centrality of the issue of Palestine,” added Abudayyeh, who also played a substantial role in helping to organize the protest Monday in Milwaukee.
“People are still out here in condemnation of Trump’s racist and reactionary agenda, in condemnation of the Republicans’ racist and reactionary agenda. That’s absolutely true. That’s why we were there on Monday,” he said. “But when it comes down to it, Biden is in power. Biden is responsible for the war [in Israel], Biden is responsible for supporting it,” Abudayyeh said. “And it is the core issue that will bring out tens of thousands at the DNC in August.”
Flores agreed that even among the groups he helped organize, he noticed a sizable contingent of people who indicated to him they were reserving energy for Chicago.
“The DNC, I do think, does have an impact on attendance [at protests] here in Milwaukee. There’s been people coming from out of state and all that, and trying to convince people to come twice, within a little over a month, to the Midwest for protests is a hard sell,” Flores said.
“A lot of people are very excited to get to the DNC because, you know, it is the incumbent party. Joe Biden has been the target of these Palestinian protests. And so I think a lot of people are feeling very motivated to protest against the Democrats,” he said.Flores added that he’d received “concerns from our coalition partners” regarding Wisconsin’s open-carry gun laws, calling it a “scary concept” that “weapons were allowed within the soft zone” but noted that “it’s nothing that we couldn’t have addressed or couldn’t mediate.”
Both organizers also suggested the weather — which, earlier in the week, rotated between scorching heat and thunderstorms — played a role in the scant protest scene.
“The weather has had something to do with it,” Abudayyeh said. “Threats of storms, it was super, super hot of course.”
The limited protest convention footprint in Milwaukee isn’t entirely unusual. During the 2016 RNC in Cleveland, for example, all the ingredients were in place for major protests to break out — including not only an angry progressive contingent but also a Republican Party that had not yet fully embraced Donald Trump. But only a handful of substantial protests broke out and there were no major clashes between rival protesters or with police. 
But expectations of what can be possible amid heightened political tensions has changed in the eight years since due to several violent domestic crises, including the deadly 2017 clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection and, most recently, the attempted assassination on Trump on Saturday.Groups on the ground in Milwaukee this week, for their part, pointed out that they were active.
The anti-war group Codepink led a pair of small demonstrations Tuesday that each featured about a half–dozen participants. Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, together with a homeless advocacy group called the Poor People’s Army, led about 80 people on a mile-long walk Monday. 
And on Tuesday, the shooting by five police officers of a knife-wielding man about a mile from the convention area prompted local outrage — but also a peaceful and modestly attended candlelit vigil and no major protests.
Codepink co-founder Medea Benjamin said attendance at her group’s events was about on par with what it expected, given heightened security concerns. 
“Milwaukee is a very small town,” she said. “There were a number of us who came in from outside, but it didn’t augment as much as it would in Chicago.”
During one of those Codepink events, group member Nour Jaghama was arrested outside the Pfister Hotel in downtown Milwaukee while attempting to protest a brunch hosted by Arkansas GOP Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  
Codepink national co-director Danaka Katovich, who witnessed Jaghama’s arrest, said the incident underscored the kind of elevated security risks inexperienced protesters might not want to face following Trump’s assassination attempt. “It was something we were worried about,” she said of the increased police presence. 
Other than that small handful of events, however, the streets of downtown Milwaukee were almost entirely empty and quiet at nearly all other moments through the four days of the RNC.
“It’s just stunning,” said Clifford Lee Johnson said Wednesday as he and three friends stood holding signs protesting against Trump inside Zeidler Union Square Park.
The four were the only ones there. 
Johnson theorized that “maybe the assassination attempt somehow scared people off.”
“Or,” he added, “maybe a lot of people have a feeling that’s just like,  ‘Why? What’s the point?’”
City officials said their protest zone planning wasn't the reason for the low protest activity — but also acknowledged surprise that so little had occurred, other than the Coalition to March on the RNC event on Monday.“Yes, there have been a few smaller unscheduled protests, in addition to the one parade route, the designated parade route — so it’s not nonexistent,” said Jeff Fleming, a spokesperson for Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and the city of Milwaukee. “We just wanted to make sure that people had the opportunity — whether they exercised that or not.”
“We are focused on having given the opportunity for people to express their opinions, to do it in a place that’s relatively close to the convention activity — and that’s safe for everybody,” Fleming added.
Flores, for his part, said that despite his disappointment, he hoped the success of his group’s protest — which he said took nearly two years to organize — would serve as an example that a large, meaningful, peaceful protest was possible. 
“I hope it sends a message that they can do this,” he said. “We showed this week that it is possible — and that we can do it in a family-friendly way.”Adam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.

NBC_16,Kamala Harris allies weighing how they could build a campaign if Biden exits,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-allies-weighing-build-campaign-biden-exits-rcna162629,2024-07-20 01:06:02.809574,,"WASHINGTON — A group of Democrats who believe Vice President Kamala Harris should be the party’s nominee if President Joe Biden steps aside have begun quietly mapping out what her presidential campaign apparatus would look like and what her path to victory could be in November, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the planning.
The effort, which Harris has not sanctioned as she continues to publicly and privately support Biden remaining in the race, comes as many are concerned that the vice president does not currently have the personnel or organization needed to quickly make the pivot to being the top ticket, the source said. If Biden were to step aside, it’s unclear how much of his campaign apparatus would remain intact and whether it would make sense to continue some of the same strategic efforts. 
“Harris doesn’t have the operation,” one source familiar with the effort said on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. “There is no outside entity organizing for her.” 
As part of their work, the informal group that includes Democratic strategists and aides with presidential campaign experience, are already mapping out how Harris’ strategy for victory could be different from the one Biden took to win in 2020 and from what he was planning to do this year. The group, which does not include Harris’ team and is not advocating for Biden to step aside, are also discussing who in Biden’s current campaign structure may need to be replaced.  
“Kamala Harris’s path is different,” one Democratic strategist said on the condition of anonymity to discuss the effort candidly. That person added some believe Harris’ path could be more focused on mobilizing Black voters in southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina rather than Biden’s strategy, which includes working to lock down Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. 
The person also stressed that those involved in the effort to get ready for a potential Harris presidential campaign believe Democrats — at all levels of the party — will have to unite and mobilize in a robust way to be successful in beating Republicans. One strategy seen as a way to win includes holding multiple rallies in states like Georgia with former First Lady Michelle Obama, who polls show remains popular among voters, and featuring events in midwestern states like Michigan with former President Bill Clinton. 
“To pull this off, the Democrats are going to have to pull off an all hands on deck strategy and I don’t know if the party is ready for this,” the source said. “Everybody has to be out.”
As the effort comes together, Trump and his allies have stepped up attacks against Harris. 
“She would have a lot of Biden’s negatives and none of the positives,” said Trump pollster Jim McLaughlin on the prospect of running against Kamala Harris.
But, some progressive groups vehemently disagree with that polling assessment. 
Way to Win, a national strategy hub for donors aligned with Democratic causes, invested money in the last few weeks into studying how voters in battleground states perceive Biden and Harris and how they can best help support Harris no matter how Biden ultimately decides to move forward.  
The group found that Biden and Harris polled similarly among Democrats and independents and had more work to do among independent voters. But, it also found, Harris had a “significant boost” from “younger voter segments that Biden has struggled with” and performed well among voters of color and women. Their data also showed Harris’ work as the administration’s most prominent advocate for access to abortion care in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago resonated powerfully with Democrats and independents.
Meanwhile, sources familiar with Harris’ thinking and who have spoken with her in recent days, say she remains a fierce defender of Biden, even as more and more Democratic lawmakers and donors have publicly called on him to step aside.

NBC_17,"Eight more Democrats, including Pelosi allies, call for Biden to exit 2024 election",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/eight-democrats-pelosi-allies-call-biden-exit-2024-election-rcna162726,2024-07-20 01:01:02.809574,,"WASHINGTON — Eight congressional Democrats on Friday joined the growing chorus of lawmakers calling on President Joe Biden to step aside as the party’s nominee, bringing the total number of Hill Democrats who want someone else at the top of the ticket to 30.
The new defections include two close allies of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as well as a third senator.
New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, who is running for re-election this fall, became the third Senate Democrat to call on Biden to leave the race, joining Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont and Sen. Jon Tester, who is facing a tough re-election bid in Montana. 
The latest Biden defections in the House hail from some of the president’s core constituencies of support. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus — whose leaders campaigned with Biden this week in Nevada — to call on Biden to bow out.
Veasey and three other House Democrats — Rep. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, issued a joint statement Friday praising Biden’s decades of public service but saying it is now time for the 82-year-old president to “pass the torch” to give Democrats the best chance of beating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.
Garcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose chairwoman, Rep. Nanette Barragán of California, also campaigned with Biden in Nevada this week and whose affiliated super PAC endorsed Biden on Friday. Other Hispanic Caucus members who earlier called for Biden to step aside are Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Mike Levin of California.
Meanwhile, Pocan is chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus, formerly the LGBTQ+ Caucus, and the former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose most high-profile members — including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — have been urging Democrats not to dump Biden.
Huffman is also a progressive who is a close ally of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and represents a San Francisco Bay Area district next to hers.
Another close Bay Area ally of Pelosi's, longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also joined the group of detractors Friday, releasing a letter that she sent to Biden Thursday night. In it, Lofgren mentioned her work on the House Jan. 6 Committee, warning that Trump ""remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection.""
“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,"" Veasey, Garcia, Pocan and Huffman wrote in their joint statement. ""These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month’s debate and are now unlikely to change.""
“We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House. Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment,” the quartet continued. “Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.”
Separately, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois called on Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune published Friday. “As long as this election is ... litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and ‘senior moments,' I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation,"" he wrote.
And Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat who is one of Republicans' top targets in 2024, said in a lengthy thread on X that ""there's too much on the line"" in 2024 for Biden to continue as the Democratic nominee.
The new batch of defections means that more than 10% of House and Senate Democrats — 30 out of 264 — are calling for Biden to exit the race. 
Biden, however, has repeatedly said he's not going anywhere, and that he has earned the nomination, backed by 14 million Democratic primary voters.  
Appearing on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon conceded that it's been a ""tough several weeks"" for Biden since his disastrous debate performance and that there has been ""some slippage in support."" But she argued that Biden still has a path to defeating Trump and that he will be out on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid.
“You have heard from the president directly time and again. He is in this race to win and he is our nominee and he’s going to be our president for a second term,"" she said.Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

NBC_18,Advocates and lawmakers want an Obamacare marketing plan for DACA recipients,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/daca-marketing-plan-biden-administration-aca-rcna162614,2024-07-20 01:00:02.809574,,"Immigration advocates are asking the Biden administration to take extra steps to make sure immigrants with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, know they are eligible to buy Affordable Care Act Insurance.
The Biden administration opened the way for DACA recipients to buy into ACA health plans through a federal regulation that went into effect in May. Like everyone else, DACA recipients can begin enrolling for the subsidized private coverage on Nov. 1.
But Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal advocacy at United We Dream, an immigration advocacy group, said if DACA recipients are to benefit, then Health and Human Services needs to help get the word out.
“HHS, in conversations that they’ve had with advocates, they’ve said they weren’t going to allocate resources to really advertise this and specifically target DACA recipients,” Macedo do Nascimento told NBC News.
HHS did not provide comment when reached.
The agency estimates about 100,000 immigrants protected by DACA will be eligible to enroll in a health plan through the ACA marketplace. Nearly 600,000 young adult immigrants have permission to work or study here and are protected from deportation through DACA, a program created under President Barack Obama.
Rep. Joaquín Castro of Texas and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, both Democrats, urged HHS in a letter this week, signed by 86 additional House and Senate members, to invest in outreach and assistance for eligible DACA members.
“Given this unique and time-sensitive opportunity, it is imperative that DACA recipients know of this opportunity, are informed about their eligibility, and are able to navigate the registration process so that they can take full advantage of their new access to medical care,” the letter states. 
The period for DACA recipients to enroll begins just days before the Nov. 5 presidential election and ends Jan. 15, 2025, less than a week before the next presidential inauguration. 
But the future of DACA itself is uncertain. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a Republican challenge to the legality of the program. If the court upholds a lower court decision that DACA is in violation of the law, the case could then go to the Supreme Court. Oral arguments have not yet been held in the 5th Circuit. 
Advocates are hoping DACA recipients' insurance coverage outlasts any contrary decision. 
“As undocumented people, there's always that concern of going to the hospital or something like that,” Macedo do Nascimento said. 
With the threat of DACA ending, “there's a short time for anyone to benefit,” she said. “The threat has become apparent to us because the case in the 5th Circuit Court. It has taken so long to set up a hearing. We think they may issue a decision without oral arguments. Access to health care shouldn’t rely on whether we have DACA.”
Enrollment in the ACA marketplace for this year hit a record high 21 million, including 5.2 million first-time enrollees, according to the KFF, a health policy and research organization.
HHS has touted that after increasing ACA outreach and education and implementing tax breaks through the American Rescue Plan, Black and Latino coverage through ACA marketplace plans spiked.
During the Trump administration, HHS cut spending on outreach and enrollment activities for ACA coverage.
Macedo do Nascimento said United We Dream has begun its own promotions and marketing to DACA recipients and will do more as the open enrollment date nears.
Though some 80% of DACA recipients are employed, more than 25% of DACA recipients are estimated to lack health insurance.
A DACA recipient, Macedo do Nascimento said even though she has insurance through her job at UWD, “knowing I have access to the ACA gives me a kind of freedom to maybe change jobs, or if I didn’t have a job anymore, then I at least could have health care.”Suzanne Gamboa is a reporter for NBC Latino.

NBC_19,FDA once again pushes back proposal to ban cancer-linked formaldehyde in hair relaxers,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/fda-delays-ban-formaldehyde-hair-products-cancer-timeline-uncertain-rcna162565,2024-07-20 01:00:02.809574,,"The Food and Drug Administration’s proposal to ban formaldehyde in hair care products has been pushed back once again, and the timeline for its release remains undetermined. 
The FDA said in October that it planned to propose a ban on formaldehyde and other formaldehyde-releasing chemicals in hair-smoothing or hair-straightening products, often called relaxers, which are mainly marketed to Black women. 
Removing the chemical from hair relaxers has been a long-standing goal for advocates. A wide range of studies have linked formaldehyde to certain cancers, including uterine cancer and blood cancer. Some companies have responded by developing formaldehyde-free formulas or by clearly labeling products that contain the chemical. Not all chemical hair relaxers include formaldehyde, but many do include components that, once heated, can release it, according to the FDA. 
The FDA initially set a target date to publish its proposed ban in April, according to a document published in the Unified Agenda, a government website that provides information on regulations under development by federal agencies. The date was moved to July, and more recently, to September.
The target dates published in the Unified Agenda are only estimates, not firm deadlines, the agency has previously said. It’s possible the proposal is released before September or further extended to another date.
The FDA declined to provide a more specific time frame for the proposal's release date. 
When asked about the reason behind the delay, an FDA spokesperson said in a statement that “the rulemaking process takes time.”
“Before a proposed rule can be published in the Federal Register for public comment, it must be reviewed and approved within FDA and other parts of the Federal government,” the spokesperson said.
Publishing the proposed rule is only one step in the process and it doesn’t mean the rule will take effect. After the FDA publishes the proposed rule and reviews public comments, they might decide to either stop the rulemaking process, propose a new version, or finalize the rule, allowing it to take effect.
The news may disappoint those who are awaiting the rule.
Melanie Benesh, the vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, a consumer product advocacy group, said in a statement that the FDA “has long been aware of the health hazards posed by formaldehyde.”
In 2011, the organization petitioned the FDA to ban hair products with formaldehyde, and again in 2021. It also filed a Freedom of Information Act request for emails pertaining to a ban on the chemical, the results of which were published in The New York Times in 2020. 
”We look forward to reading a new rule that will protect salon workers and consumers from exposure to formaldehyde in hair-straightening products,” Benesh said. 
An FDA fact sheet currently advises against the use of hair-straightening products containing formaldehyde and related compounds.

NBC_20,Brittney Griner to Evan Gershkovich after he was sentenced in Russia: 'Don't lose hope',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brittney-griner-evan-gershkovich-was-sentenced-russia-dont-lose-hope-rcna162720,2024-07-20 02:13:02.833596,,"WNBA star and Olympian Brittney Griner, who was released from a Russian prison last year, encouraged American journalist Evan Gershkovich in an NBC News interview to ""stay strong"" following his sentencing in Russia on Friday.
Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison after he was found guilty of espionage in a case that his employer, The Wall Street Journal, and the U.S. government has condemned as a sham.
Gershkovich, 32, denied any wrongdoing in the case that went to trial last month in the city of Yekaterinburg, over a year after he was arrested in the southern Russian city on espionage charges.
To watch the full interview, tune in to “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT or check your local listings.
Griner, who was released in December after serving about 10 months in a Russian penal colony, said on Friday her heart goes out to Gershkovich and his loved ones.
“I went through that, and I understand what that means,"" Griner said.
""We have to get him back, we have to,"" she said, with a message to the journalist: ""Don't lost hope.""
In February 2022, Griner traveled to Russia to play her eighth season in the country’s women’s basketball league. She was arrested at a Moscow airport after two vials of cannabis oil, totaling less than a gram, were found in her luggage at the airport in Moscow. 
Griner pleaded guilty at her trial in July but said she had no criminal intent, and packed the canisters inadvertently as she hurriedly prepared for her flight. She was sentenced to nine years in prison. 
She was released after the Biden administration negotiated her release in exchange for arms dealer Viktor Bout.
Griner is gearing up to head to Paris for her third Olympics — her first time traveling abroad since leaving Russia.
“I’m ready, I’m at a good place,” Griner said, adding that she has “a really good support system.”
Gershkovich had been found guilty of collecting secret information about the activities of a defense enterprise for the production and repair of military equipment on instructions from U.S. intelligence services.
Sverdlovsk Region Court’s judge Andrei Mineyev remanded Gershkovich into custody until his sentence can be legally enforced. The journalist is also expected to cover the legal fees, amounting to just over $75.

NBC_21,How Trump used the Republican convention to shift the party his way,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-used-republican-convention-shift-party-way-rcna162739,2024-07-20 02:09:02.833596,,"MILWAUKEE — From the passage of a party platform that de-emphasized longtime core conservative social issues to the selection of anti-intervention populist Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, this week’s Republican convention underlined and bolded former President Donald Trump’s roadmap to take back the White House.
Abortion, gun rights and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol received little if any attention. The speaker lineup featured a union president, an OnlyFans model and disaffected Black and Latino Democrats, angered over crime and immigration, up and down the roster. 
It was no accident. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, now fully under his control, are trying to entice traditionally Democratic-leaning constituencies that are disillusioned with the GOP, including working-class union members and young, relatively nonideological Black and Latino voters. 
The convention marked the most direct appeal to them the party has ever made, bringing in speakers who were somewhat jarring to traditional GOP constituencies. This indicates that the Trump campaign believes it has a better chance at attracting those voters than at winning back the Trump-to-President Joe Biden crossover voters who left him in 2020 — most notably, the well-educated and suburban white voters who cast many votes for Nikki Haley in the 2024 GOP primary.
“This is not your father’s GOP anymore,” Mike Gonidakis, a Republican delegate from Ohio and president of Ohio Right to Life, told NBC News. “This is the Trump GOP now.”
Most Republican lawmakers and delegates who spoke with NBC News embraced what they saw as an effort to broaden the tent as opposed to an abandonment of some conservative policy aims.
“Of course, I’d love to hear every single night, talking about life,” Gonidakis said. “But we have to win in order to govern, and in order to govern, you have to win, right? So what we need to do is broaden our appeal to people because it’s the long game, the strategy, of actually bringing in a bigger tent. Changing hearts and minds.” 
These appeals were evident in both Trump’s and Vance’s speeches before conventiongoers.
“You know who is being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country?” Trump said. “The Black population and the Hispanic population.”
One night prior, Vance hit the other angle, railing against the North American Free Trade Agreement and corporate America.
“We need a leader who’s not in the pocket of big business, but answers to the working man — union and nonunion alike,” the senator from Ohio said. “A leader who won’t sell out to multinational corporations, but will stand up for American companies and American industry. A leader who rejects Joe Biden [and] Kamala Harris’ ‘Green New Scam’ and fights to bring back our great American factories.”
A recent NBC News poll demonstrated the softness in Biden’s coalition that Trump is trying to exploit. Overall, Trump led Biden by 2 points among voters in the new poll. Inside the data, the survey showed that among voters under 30, Biden led by a mere 4 points. (He carried voters under 30 by 24 points in 2020, according to NBC News exit polling.) Among Black voters, Biden led by 57 points (after winning them by 75 points in 2020). Among Latino voters, Biden led by 16 points (after winning them by 33 points in 2020).
Democrats pushed back on Trump’s effort, especially his message aimed at Black and Latino voters. Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison dismissed the outreach as “Trump’s streak of lip service and photo ops,” adding that the convention included “insulting stereotypes — like arguing that voters of color should support him because he is a felon.” 
Democrats also argued that Trump’s agenda when he was president was detrimental to these voters and that, particularly voters of color, would see through his effort.
“Voters of color are sophisticated and are looking for who is fighting for them — they won’t be distracted by Trump’s off-brand sneakers or fast-food giveaways, and they haven’t forgotten Trump’s record of harming our communities,” Sarafina Chitka, a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign, said.
The messaging wasn’t totally uniform in its effort to reach out to nontraditional GOP voters. At one point in his speech, Trump tore into the head of the United Auto Workers days after giving a featured speaking slot to Teamsters head Sean O’Brien. Immediately after Ric Grenell, a Trump foreign policy adviser who is gay, mentioned in his address Wednesday that Trump “doesn’t care if you’re gay or straight, Black, brown or white, or what gender you are,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., took the stage to claim that under Trump “there were two genders.”
Trump did seek to make similar appeals to these voters during the 2020 convention, but this week’s iteration was his most fulsome and eye-opening effort yet, particularly because of who was speaking. Amber Rose, a model and OnlyFans performer, described initially doubting Trump’s sincerity until she did her own research. More than any other speaker, her presence signaled a willingness to put on the back burner traditional social conservative issues to better reach nontraditional voters.
“My message to you tonight comes from a humble place; the left told me to hate Trump,” Rose said. “And even worse, to hate the other side, the people who support him. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth. American families were better when Donald Trump was president.”
On the economic front, it was O’Brien’s speech that signaled an openness to burying some conservative orthodoxy on economics, bashing the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable.
“I wasn’t sure how it was going to go,” Riley Moore, the West Virginia state treasurer and a favorite to win a congressional seat there this fall, said of O’Brien’s speech. “But I think when he saw the reception that he had here, that represented to me a very strong partnership nationally. JD Vance literally encapsulates that shift. And I think it is happening quick. There’s going to be a sea change for this Republican Party. It has been since Trump was elected, but it’s going to continue under Vance.”
Biden allies were quick to seize on the pushback within the labor movement to O’Brien’s speech. As he spoke, the AFL-CIO’s official X account posted: “Some would love for workers to take Trump at his word & forget what he did as President. But we didn’t forget. And Project 2025 shows he’ll pick up right where he left off: dissolving unions, gutting worker protections, & defunding whole parts of the government people rely on.” 
Still, two labor sources said the political threat to Democrats is real, with one saying that “far-right MAGA ideology” has some momentum among rank-and-file union members. NBC News polling data shows that the battle for voters in union households is close, though Democrats still have an edge.
Republicans in Milwaukee, meanwhile, said the messaging struck the right balance between the interests of the base versus expanding the tent.
“To quote Goldilocks, the temperature of the porridge is about right,” Sen. Steve Daines, of Montana, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told NBC News. He added: “The working class in this country is [saying Democrats are] going way too far to the left.”
The tone was first set in crafting the Republican platform before the convention. Before pen was put to paper, Trump’s allies took an active role in fights over who would serve on the platform committee — an effort that was intended to stop conservatives from pushing the document too far to the right on abortion and same-sex marriage, platform mainstays for years. 
The concise platform, which Trump was an active part of drafting and editing, according to a source familiar with the process, did include some language on abortion — but it went nowhere near as far as past GOP platforms or what anti-abortion rights activists pushed for this time. And it made no mention of same-sex marriage. Other culture war issues that have gained steam since the pandemic were included, such as barring transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports.
There was still some dissent to the GOP’s convention path.
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who was praised by O’Brien, said the platform nailed its planks on the populist economic front and described O’Brien’s speech as “electric.” But he questioned why Republicans would distance themselves from traditional social conservative issues.
“I don’t see any reason to do that,” Hawley said, adding, “As Republicans, I think we ought to be advocating strongly a pro-life position on principle, then this platform to me seems to water that down. I just don’t know why. I think there’s no reason for that.”
“I just think it’s an electoral mistake,” he added. “I don’t think it gives you anything. I think it hurts you with conservative, pro-life evangelical, conservative Catholic voters to compromise on that. And the same with marriage. I don’t understand the calculation, but I think it’s not wise.”
But one person at a conservative think tank said they didn’t think Trump would lose anything electorally from backing away from those issues.
“Trump didn’t care much about those issues before 2016,” this person said. “He rebranded himself as caring about these issues. It was a way to get the evangelical vote. And once he got it, he now has it. He’s not going to lose it over that. The number of passionate pro-life evangelicals who are going to stay home and not vote for Trump because he’s wishy-washy on abortion is so small.”
Mike Elder, a GOP delegate from South Carolina, said the messaging shift was smart to appear less “hard line.” He appreciated O’Brien’s and Rose’s speeches.

NBC_22,Crypto CEO resigns after posting about 'literal war' against Trump opponents,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/crypto-ceo-resigns-posting-literal-war-trump-opponents-rcna162719,2024-07-20 02:06:02.833596,,"A prominent cryptocurrency CEO turned outspoken supporter of Donald Trump is resigning from the company he helped build after posting incendiary remarks on X in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt on the Republican presidential nominee. 
Ryan Selkis, who posts on X as “twobitidiot,” said Friday he was stepping down as CEO of Masseri, a crypto data company, after his “politics and rhetoric put the team in harms way,” he said.
Following the attempt on Trump’s life in Pennsylvania, Selkis took to X and seemed to call for violence against non-Trump supporters. 
“Anyone that votes against Trump at this point can die in a f—--g fire,” he said on X in a since-deleted post Saturday following the attempt. “Literal war,” Selkis added.
In a follow-up post he said: “The Civil War for the country started today, and if you are anti-Trump you are against the men who are willing to fight. Good luck.”
Selkis later wrote: “If I were a Cultural Marxist hellbent on destroying the country, I would have weathered the storm. But I told the truth too many times, and lost my temper after they tried to kill the President last Saturday.”
In his resignation statement Friday, Selkis said he was “disgusted at the media and administration’s abject failures at pressing for answers in the attack’s aftermath, as well as their failure to tamp down the divisive rhetoric that contributed to the attack in the first place.”
“I will be channeling all of my energies into addressing the underlying issues that have led to these systemic problems in our institutions,” Selkis said, without elaborating.
Selkis did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. His successor, Eric Turner, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The development comes amid a clear turn within the crypto world toward Trump — as the Republican nominee reciprocates the interest. Under the heading “Championing Innovation,” Trump wrote crypto into his party’s new platform, stating: “Republicans will end Democrats’ unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency. We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.”
Trump is also slated to speak at next week’s annual Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.But Trump’s return to the Oval Office is no sure thing, and crypto leaders continue to press their case to current Biden administration officials for a more accommodating regulatory environment that will allow for greater access to crypto products.
Mainstream acceptance of crypto thus remains a key goal that Selkis’ remarks may have been seen as inhibiting.  
Masseri, which Selkis founded in 2018, has the backing of major financial institutions including  Point72 Ventures, the private investment arm of Steve Cohen’s Point72 financial group; and hedge fund giant Brevan Howard.
A representative for Brevan Howard said the firm had no comment. A Point72 spokesperson did not respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
NBC_23,"Ignoring controversy, Democrats move forward with nominating Biden via virtual roll call",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ignoring-controversy-democrats-move-forward-nominating-biden-virtual-r-rcna162161,2024-07-20 02:00:02.833596,,"Democrats are in an unprecedented crisis over who should be their presidential candidate.
But the party committee that governs the nominating process met Friday and proceeded as if everything was normal and its entire plan was not at risk of being upended at any minute.
As calls mount for President Joe Biden to step aside and let another Democrat lead the party into the November election against former President Donald Trump, the Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee held a virtual meeting where the message to delegates was, essentially: Everything is proceeding as planned.
The meeting was convened to discuss plans for a virtual roll call vote to formally nominate Biden weeks before the convention, but no votes were taken or decisions made. Instead, party leaders used the meeting to inform the nearly 200 members of the committee about the process that is currently planned, which they had already laid out in a letter earlier this week.
The committee will meet again on Friday, July 26, at noon to consider adopting the virtual roll call process, which would not be held until the first week of August.
The virtual roll call idea has plenty of detractors inside the party, but the only hint of dissent in the meeting came in questions about whether other candidates could be nominated for the virtual roll call (answer: technically yes, but actually, probably not). Otherwise, the virtual meeting was uneventful — despite starting moments after four more Democratic members of Congress called on Biden to step aside.
Party leaders like Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison spoke repeatedly about his excitement to “renominate President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris” and to promote the “Biden-Harris ticket.”
Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democratic rules expert and the co-chair of the Rules Committee, joked about trying to turn the committee members into “rules geeks” by the end of the process.
And convention Executive Director Alex Hornbrook, appearing from his office in Chicago with a large, red “Biden” banner over his left shoulder, gushed about the exciting events planned for next month’s convention and touted that the convention is credentialing social media influencers just like traditional reporters to help “tell the story of the Biden-Harris accomplishments” to young people.
The purpose of the meeting was to lay out the party’s proposed fix to a paperwork problem that has been causing some outsize heartburn for Democrats as they debate whether Biden should remain their nominee.
Parties typically formally nominate their candidates at their national conventions, during live roll call votes where each state weighs in (Trump was nominated on Monday in this fashion). But since May, Democrats have been discussing plans to nominate Biden weeks before the convention via a virtual vote, in order to avoid a potential legal issue in Ohio.
Ohio has an Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit the names of their nominees for the ballot, but the Democratic convention does not start until Aug. 19. Similar issues had been fixed easily in years past, but the Republicans who control Ohio’s state Legislature resisted amending the law. They finally did, but waited so long that the fix will not go into effect until Sept. 1 — meaning the Aug. 7 deadline will still technically be on the books when that date comes and passes.
Ohio’s top election official, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, says the issue has been resolved and the discrepancy is not a problem. His spokesperson said Democrats are just trying to “scapegoat Ohio for their own party’s dysfunction.”
But Democrats do not trust Republicans and worry that waiting to nominate Biden at the convention could expose them to risky and costly litigation from Republicans. (Trump allies could still sue Ohio officials and insist that a judge rule Biden can’t be on the ballot.)
“Ballot access deadlines are not something to take risks with,” said former Biden White House counsel Dana Remus, who was also general counsel for Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.
Some Democrats have worried that the virtual roll call is an attempt to shut down the debate over whether Biden should remain on the ticket and essentially lock in his nomination. But Biden is already in firm control of the process.
Remus is now acting as legal counsel to the Democratic National Committee. And that role, and her presence on the virtual Rules Committee meeting, underscored how much power his allies have over the party.
As is typical for the party that controls the White House, the Democratic National Committee is stacked with handpicked Biden allies, chosen for loyalty as much as anything else.
And during the primaries, in which Biden ran essentially unopposed, he won 99% of the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates to the national convention.
Biden could still step aside and be replaced after being formally nominated in the virtual roll call, experts say.
“This doesn’t mean we’d be stuck with one person if that person isn’t willing to run,” Elaine Kamarck, a longtime DNC member and party rules expert with the Brookings Institution, said on a separate briefing for Democratic delegates Friday. “If they have a virtual roll call and Biden then drops out before the convention, the Rules Committee just goes back [and amends the process].”Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News.

NBC_24,"Microsoft outage takes down Starbucks mobile ordering, causing chaos for baristas",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/starbucks-mobile-ordering-taken-microsoft-outage-rcna162734,2024-07-20 03:18:02.964619,,"An information technology glitch affecting Microsoft cloud computing services around the world Friday has also halted the ability to order Starbucks through its mobile app.
The issue has caused chaos for baristas and other Starbucks employees, leading to temporary store closures and frantic posts online seeking assistance.
A new software update to fix the problem was issued Friday morning by CrowdStrike, which provides cybersecurity services for many large companies that use Microsoft, but in the afternoon businesses were still working through technical issues and delays. Starbucks is no exception to the chaos. 
“Starbucks is among those companies experiencing impacts due to a widespread third-party systems outage, resulting in a temporary outage of our mobile order ahead and pay features,” Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement emailed to NBC News. “We continue to welcome and serve customers in the vast majority of our stores and drive-thrus and are doing everything we can to bring all systems online as quickly as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience.”
Responding to the IT glitch that affected mobile ordering, early on Friday Starbucks began prompting users on its app that mobile ordering is unavailable. 
An official Starbucks account began responding to social media posts, too, saying that some stores were unavailable to process any transactions and had closed as a result. The account also responded to people who said they placed mobile orders and were then unable to pick them up.
“Stores may be unable to process transactions and some stores may be closed. Mobile ordering is also currently unavailable. For stores that are open, we invite you to place your order with a barista,” the official Starbucks account wrote in one reply.
Since 2015, customers have been able to place orders at participating stores through the Starbucks app and pick them up without waiting in line. The mobile order system has become so popular that some Starbucks locations, such as those in some airports, have introduced mobile-only storefronts.  
On the Starbucks subreddit, where customers and employees have both posted about app and in-store technical issues, recent posts described stressful situations and posted photos of mobile order errors.
“Almost every store in my district except mine closed because they didn’t want to deal with the outages,” one Reddit post from an account labeled as a store supervisor said. “We are SUFFERING. Mobile orders and deliveries were through the roof, drive thru was wrapped around the building and two accidents in our parking lot.”
Another Starbucks employee and Reddit user took to the subreddit to beg for help, seeking creative solutions to working during the outage. “Please, as a fellow barista, tell me the procedures your store is taking to work during this outage,” the employee wrote. “Currently my store is scrambling to keep up, myself and other partners keep offering suggestions (like putting up a sign, or writing on cups) but my store manager isn’t being receptive.”
A barista at a newly renovated Starbucks in Washington, D.C., told CNBC that her store had to manually write out tickets for customer orders as they grappled with computer issues in the early morning. The location has disabled mobile ordering, and the barista said that their point-of-sale came back online around 7:00 a.m.
At other stores, employees created various handwritten signs for customers, announcing store closures or asking customers to walk up or show an employee a mobile receipt. 
Online, other employees described their stores as being slower than usual, with some customers saying they chose not to go in because they couldn’t do a mobile order. When NBC News visited several Starbucks locations in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, lines were short and moved quickly. Four customers said they had no issue ordering in line instead of using the mobile app. 
One of the customers, Linda Muller, said she found out about the issue Friday morning when a friend couldn’t place their Starbucks mobile order. But Muller, who was visiting from Switzerland, said she was used to standing in line — the app isn’t available at all back home, she said.Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News."
NBC_25,Charlottesville tiki-torch rioter endorses Donald Trump at his Jan. 6 sentencing,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/charlottesville-tiki-torch-rioter-endorses-donald-trump-jan-6-sentenci-rcna162209,2024-07-20 03:04:02.964619,,"WASHINGTON — A far-right extremist who already served time for his role in the racist ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville in 2017 was sentenced to more than four years in federal prison Friday for stealing a police shield and twice using it against officers during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Tyler Bradley Dykes, who was previously discharged from the Marines for “participating in extremist behavior,” was accused by prosecutors of giving a Sieg heil! (Hail to victory!) salute during the 2021 Capitol attack. But Dykes, a 26-year-old from Bluffton, South Carolina, denied that his celebration on the steps of the U.S. Capitol after the mob broke through a police line had been the Nazi salute.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell didn’t find his claim believable, noting that he’d use the same salute during the Charlottesville rally and noted an extensive pattern of extremist behavior over several years.
Howell sentenced Dykes to 57 months in federal prison and fined him $20,000. During the sentencing hearing, Dykes said that he still stood with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and that he supports Trump ""to be the next president of our country.""
Prosecutors noted that Dykes quoted Adolph Hitler before the Jan. 6 attack and said during the hearing that Dykes had participated in a training for the neo-Nazi accelerationist group, The Base. 
""It was not impulsive conduct that can be explained by an underdeveloped brain,"" Howell said.
Howell also took offense to the suggestion, from one of Dykes' attorneys, that his use of the salute was inconsequential.
""You don't think using a Sieg heil! salute makes a difference?"" she asked, before encouraging the lawyer to move on from the argument that there was some doubt about whether it was actually a Nazi salute. ""Facts are facts."" 
Dykes, who prosecutors said went by “Nocturnal Wolf"" in online chats and stored extensive extremist material, was charged in connection with the Capitol attack in July 2023 and pleaded guilty in April to two felony counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers who were protecting the Capitol. At the time he was taken into federal custody, he was serving a five-year sentence for his actions in Charlottesville, but 4.5 years of that sentence were suspended and he ended up only doing four months in connection with that case. 
Dykes was prosecuted and convicted in Virginia for burning an object with an intent to intimidate, and federal prosecutors noted he ""carried a lit torch, performed the Sieg Heil salute, and he marched with others to express his white supremacist views"" during that 2017 march. They also said video showed that Dykes engaged in assaultive conduct in Charlottesville. His arrest in the Charlottesville case didn't come about until 2023 and he was wearing the same Adidas baseball hat he wore on Jan. 6 when he was taken into custody, which helped the FBI confirm his identity and led to his arrest on Jan. 6 charges.
During Friday's hearing, Dykes did not distance himself from extremist ideologies, nor did he say he no longer believes the former president's lies about the election. His biggest expression of regret seemed to be for his elderly parents, who adopted him as a child and who are still providing him with a monthly allowance, he said. Dykes had set up a thriving computer business before his arrest and said even now he's bringing in $9,000 a month, the equivalent of a six-figure salary.
Dykes told Howell that he felt an adrenaline rush unlike anything he'd ever felt before on Jan. 6, saying it was more than a roller coaster or bungee jumping. ""I falsely believed that I would be free of consequences,"" he said.
Two officers who faced off with Dykes during the Capitol attack were present in the courtroom for his sentencing. One of the men, a former Capitol Police officer referred to in court as ""Lt. R.R.,"" spoke about the trauma that he and his fellow officers endured at the hands of the pro-Trump mob, who believed the former president's lies about the 2020 election. 
Lt. R.R., who told NBC News after the hearing that he only wished to be identified by the initials he used in court, said that he was initially part of the response to the pipe bombs left at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee buildings, which are located near the Capitol complex. But he felt a duty to respond to the Capitol itself after hearing the commotion and chaos unfolding over the radio.
""I couldn't turn my back on the Capitol,"" he said. ""It was a matter of life and death.""
Rioters grabbed him, he said. They punched him. He was hit with pipes, flag poles and pepper spray so often that he lost vision. In training, he said, officers had all the water they needed to decontaminate from the chemical spray. On Jan. 6, they had to use mere ounces, often splitting water bottles between two officers who had been hit with spray.
One of the most disturbing things he heard were calls from rioters telling him to leave, to abandon his post, to let the mob take over the building and get to the lawmakers that police were protecting. That offended him, he said.
""As if I was only there for show and I don't really care about democracy,"" he said.
Lt. R.R. said he found it ""bizarre"" that rioters were singing the national anthem during an assault on the democratic process and said that he wondered how members of the mob thought a similar fight should play out after the next election, or in reaction to news from the Supreme Court. Do they just think whoever uses the most violence should win?, he wondered aloud.
""I think that democracy and the rule of law is fragile, and it's not guaranteed,"" Lt. R.R. said. ""That's not the America I believe in.""
Elsewhere in the federal courthouse, a member of the far-right group America First, who are often referred to as ""Groypers,"" was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. Joseph Brody was on the floor of the U.S. Senate, inside former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, on Jan. 6, 2021, and lifted a metal barricade as an officer struggled to keep the mob from breaching the north doors to the Capitol.
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich said she was concerned about Brody's ""reluctance to launch"" even after graduating high school with a 4.0 GPA. Brody, who was a paid campaign worker for Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin during the 2022 campaign, said he had worked at Target and Chipotle in the past, but he had not been employed recently because he wasn't sure what his future held. Brody told the court that he lacked the ""courage to go against the crowd"" on Jan. 6.Ryan J. Reilly is a justice reporter for NBC News."
NBC_26,Foreign officials courted Trump allies at the Republican convention,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/foreign-officials-courted-trump-allies-republican-convention-rcna161873,2024-07-20 03:00:02.964619,,"MILWAUKEE — Top foreign officials courted Donald Trump's allies during the Republican National Convention, scoring face time and last-minute invites — all in order to build relationships if the former president returns to office. 
Foreign officials were caught off guard when Trump won the White House in 2016, and they don’t want to find themselves flat-footed again.
“Now, it’s more urgent than ever,” said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland, who said the outreach has accelerated visibly since the debate last month — something he has encouraged. “It looks more likely that Trump will win. And they don’t want to wait.”
Trump’s ""America First"" approach to foreign policy and trade is a departure from a Republican Party that had long prioritized sweeping defense budgets and overseas intervention. His policies would also be a sharp break from those of President Joe Biden's administration and also potentially at odds with some of America's European allies. 
Trump has warned that if NATO countries, for example, don't meet their NATO treaty defense spending obligations, he would not protect them from Moscow and would let Russia ""do whatever the hell they want."" 
NATO leaders also worry that a Trump presidency could mean a drop in U.S. aid to Ukraine. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to talk by phone Friday.
The diplomatic outreach was already in full swing early in the week as ambassadors and other foreign officials touched down in Milwaukee. 
Politico Playbook reported more than 17 ambassadors were at events in Milwaukee as part of the Republican convention, including from Azerbaijan, Denmark, Greece, Iraq, Norway, Singapore and Ukraine. NBC News also confirmed the attendance of ambassadors from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Poland, France, Ireland, Israel and the European Union. 
The European Union's head of press said that more than 15 ambassadors from the E.U. were at the convention.
Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to the U.S., said that she and her team have spent their evenings gliding among the top-level suites at the convention, mingling with Trump’s allies, senior staff and other prominent Republicans. 
The hope is “to learn something more about what would make a Trump administration tick — Trump 2.0,” said Pierce, who presented her credentials to Trump upon her arrival in Washington during his final year in office. Pierce has maintained ties with the former president, traveling with Britain’s then-foreign secretary, David Cameron, to Mar-a-Lago in April, where support for Ukraine was on the agenda.
On social media, former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave some insight into what Trump has been up to since arriving Sunday, sharing a smiling side-by-side photograph with the former president, and a vouch of confidence that the former president would stand by Ukraine. 
The picture showed Trump’s ear bandaged after a shooter took aim at him Saturday, an attack that, paired with his surge in the polls, has awakened some diplomats to the need to ramp up their engagements with his circle. 
A student of American politics who served in the U.S. early in her career and grew up watching the U.S. conventions on British television as a kid, Pierce said her team is investing more resources at the congressional and state levels in governors' offices, and will be on the ground at the Democratic convention next month. 
“The rest of the world often misunderstands U.S. politics. They always think America is talking to them when America is talking to itself,” she said.
Later that day, former British Prime Minister Liz Truss passed through security at the stately Pfister Hotel, where inside, under painted murals, Republican operatives and lobbyists milled with hotel guests and the U.S. Secret Service. 
Upstairs, Wolfgang Ischinger, head of the Munich Security Conference Foundation and a former German ambassador to the U.S., appealed to a gathering of Republicans and international officials, saying, “We’ve never been more dependent on the U.S.” 
Four people in attendance said they wondered whether this was a strong message for a room of Trump allies, including former Trump defense official Elbridge Colby, who is expected to return in a future administration and has telegraphed reduced support for Ukraine and a focus instead on the increasing threat posed by China. 
But most of the action was taking place at another hotel on the edge of the convention’s security perimeter. 
On Wednesday, Rupert Murdoch, joined by his new bride, sat down for an early dinner at the Trade Hotel on an outdoor terrace overlooking a security checkpoint. Former Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn occupied a high top a few feet away. Roger Stone was at the bar eating a steak. Investor Omeed Malik chatted with friends. A group of British diplomats was also holding court. Lara Trump and other family members passed by the lobby as they made their way to the convention arena. 
The scene — all of which occurred over the course of an hour — was reminiscent of the days when Trump’s hotel in Washington became a magnet for his allies and anyone hoping to reach them. 
The diplomatic groundswell has become a topic of heated discussion on the convention reception circuit this week as aides grappled with the newfound attention, which has accelerated since President Joe Biden’s faltering debate performance three weeks ago. 
“There’s a recognition that they’re not going to make the mistakes of 2016 when they refused to admit that Trump could win,” said Kenneth Weinstein, emeritus president of the Hudson Institute and Trump’s nominee to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan. “People don’t want to be caught off guard again.”
Before arriving in Milwaukee, he had heard from the ambassadors from Israel, Germany, Korea and Sweden to expect to see them on the ground. 
By Tuesday, Weinstein had met with ambassadors from Korea, Canada, Australia and Holland, he said. 
“Right now, they’re trying to figure out what Trump’s going to do,” he said.
One senior Republican aide said officials from Poland and Romania had also turned up at events. 
Weinstein recalled the scramble that kicked off after Trump’s 2016 election victory when anybody who was seen as close to Trump was suddenly “bombarded with phone calls, emails, meetings, invitations” from Washington’s diplomatic set.  
These officials are spending time getting to know former and potential future Trump officials in the backrooms of downtown Milwaukee. They are catching up with old friends. And in quieter moments, some are fretting about what a future Trump administration could mean for their national security. 
“They’re crawling all over,” said one senior Republican staffer taken by many of the foreign officials' efforts to score invites and push their way into private GOP events at the convention. 
For Ric Grenell, a close adviser to Trump who served as his ambassador to Germany, there are merits to Trump’s at times hard-to-read approach. 
“World leaders absolutely are uncomfortable with the unpredictability of Donald Trump,” Grenell said during a Bloomberg News roundtable this week, during his ninth Republican convention. “They don’t know exactly what he’s going to do next and that’s a positive for us, and so they make decisions and react differently knowing, ‘I just can’t figure him out.’”
He recounted a meeting with Angela Merkel, who was the German chancellor at the time, that he said illustrated this point. 
“Chancellor Merkel once said to me, ‘The problem with your president is I just can’t figure him out. I don’t know what he’s going to do.’ And I remember thinking to myself, 'Don’t smile too big,'” Grenell said. 
At the convention, one European ambassador said allies were struck by the clarity of former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s message and her focus on foreign policy. But this could be a short-lived feeling, the source said. The expectation is that Trump's vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, “will undo some of the comfort that some of them may have taken from Nikki Haley,” the ambassador said.
Officials who have taken stock of Trump’s political strength are working overtime to spruce up their ties to the former president and his circles, an effort that, for some, is squarely trained on one party.  
Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said it's also an opportunity to directly challenge “the standard tropes” of Europeans not pulling their weight or taking advantage of the U.S. when it comes to defense and burden sharing. 
For those who fear a worst-case scenario if Trump wins a victory in November, Fried said there is evidence to suggest some room for maneuver.
He emphasized that not all of Trump world “will take the hardest, most anti-NATO line in practice,” pointing to the debate against Biden in which Trump took credit for increased European defense spending. 
While there may be policy differences, the outreach “is not an empty or futile or forlorn gesture,” Fried said. “I’m not saying it will work, but there is a reasonable basis to think that these kinds of discussions can be held.” 
The outreach this week has been broadly welcomed.
“It’s good,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Trump’s closest allies in the Senate, said of the rapidly accelerating courtship happening around him in Milwaukee.
Even as it has taken some by surprise, as when an unexpected guest appeared at the door of Fox Business host Larry Kudlow, an economic adviser to Trump who served as director of the National Economic Council during his first term.
Outside was the European Union ambassador to the U.S., eager to get Kudlow's perspective on how to prepare for a future Trump presidency. 
Kudlow could be heard wondering if this was a necessary encounter, according to a source familiar with the interaction.
When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the ambassador said the European Union is seeking a range of input and will also attend the Democratic convention next month. 
""We are attending both conventions and meeting a wide range of people to understand what kind of policies the next US administrations might have and to remind them of the importance of our transatlantic partnership,"" Adriana Brassart said.
There are easier ways to get a sense of Trump’s thinking, some who know him say. 
A foreign policy adviser to Trump, Keith Kellogg, said he has one major piece of advice for those trying to get a sense of Trump’s thinking. In recent weeks, Kellogg has been in touch with scores of foreign ambassadors, foreign ministers, defense ministers and national security advisers as they try to get a sense of what the future holds. Now, he is on the ground in Milwaukee, fielding even more requests.
His advice? Pick up the phone.

NBC_27,Federal Reserve fines Walmart-linked Green Dot Corp $44 million after customers lost access to funds,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/federal-reserve-fines-green-dot-44-million-customer-funds-fiasco-rcna162771,2024-07-20 04:23:02.845041,,"Green Dot Corp., a company that partners with Walmart to sell prepaid debit cards at the retail giant, has been fined $44 million by the Federal Reserve for ""numerous"" alleged failures that harmed consumers over a period of at least five years.
In a release Friday, the Fed said Austin-based Green Dot had violated consumer law and committed unfair and deceptive practices that resulted in users being unable to access their own money.
The Fed identified instances of purported wrongdoing by Green Dot starting in 2017 and continuing through December 2022 that included failing to properly close accounts and assessing fees on them, and denying certain customers access to funds while offering inadequate ways for those customers to redress the situation. 
It also said Green Dot failed to notify customers that they could no longer register debit cards by phone after the company discontinued that service, and that it failed to properly disclose the fee it charged while partnering on tax-refund deposits with TurboTax.   
In addition to the fine, Green Dot is required to implement numerous new compliance efforts that Federal Reserve regulators must approve.  
Last year, NBC News reported on issues faced by Green Dot card users that extended beyond the timeline identified by the Fed, with affected customers describing ""nightmare"" scenarios as recently as August 2023 of being unable to pay bills on time because they could not gain timely access to their money.  
A Green Dot spokesperson said most of the issues identified by NBC News reporting were the result of a system upgrade.  
In a statement Friday, Green Dot CEO George Gresham said the company was ""pleased to confirm the consent order has been finalized.""
""The order relates to practices in place years ago, and we have taken and will continue taking meaningful steps to correct and remediate those issues, including significant updates to our processes, our product packaging and marketing, our management team and our compliance programs,"" Gresham said. 
""We are committed to cooperating and partnering closely with our regulators to ensure all concerns noted in the consent order are addressed and complied with and that our customers are well-served and protected on an ongoing basis. As stewards of our customers’ valued resources, we take this commitment and responsibility very seriously.""
Green Dot had signaled in March that an enforcement action was coming as part of its first quarter earnings report.

NBC_28,Mexican president calls Donald Trump ‘a friend’ and says he’ll warn him against closing border,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexican-president-calls-donald-trump-friend-says-ll-warn-closing-borde-rcna162776,2024-07-20 04:05:02.845041,,"Mexico’s president called Donald Trump “a friend” Friday and said he would write to the former U.S. president to warn him against pledging to close the border or blaming migrants for bringing drugs into the United States.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called Trump, president from 2017 to 2021 and again the Republican nominee for this fall’s presidential election, “a man of intelligence and vision,” despite Trump’s repeated calls to close the two countries’ border. Obrador is the country's outgoing leader, and President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will take office on Oct. 1.
Mexicans were offended in 2015 when then-candidate Trump claimed that, in many cases, immigrants arriving in the U.S. illegally included “criminals, drug dealers, rapists.”
And Mexico was shocked in 2019 when Trump as president threatened to close the border “for a long time” unless Mexican authorities stopped migrants from crossing. López Obrador said the two countries’ economies were so intertwined that they couldn’t bear a closure for even a month.
López Obrador said that in a letter he planned to send next week, “I am going to prove to him that migrants don’t carry drugs to the United States,” adding that “closing the border won’t solve anything, and anyway, it can’t be done.”
“They wouldn’t last a month with the border closed,” he said, referring to U.S. automakers and manufacturers who depend on a steady, uninterrupted supply of parts and finished products for their plants on both sides of the border.
López Obrador also addressed a growing discomfort in the United States with the massive transfer of U.S. auto companies to lower-wage plants in Mexico.
López Obrador claimed that moving auto production back to the United States “would mean that on average, each automobile sold would cost U.S. citizens between $15,000 and $20,000 more.”
Despite the frequent frictions and Trump’s belligerent statements, the two leaders had an outwardly amicable relationship between 2018 and 2020, with López Obrador agreeing to use Mexico’s National Guard to make it harder for third-country migrants to cross Mexico to the U.S. border. He has also done that during the current U.S. administration."
NBC_29,U.S. Olympic basketball star Brittney Griner ready to represent 'the country that fought for me to come back',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/olympics-brittney-griner-basketball-rcna162763,2024-07-20 04:04:02.845041,,"The 2024 Paris Olympics will take on a particularly special meaning for Brittney Griner.
The WNBA star will be competing for her country for the third time in Paris — and the first time since she was detained in Russia on drug charges for nearly 10 months in 2022.
“BG is locked in and ready to go,” Griner told NBC News on Friday. “I’m happy, I’m in a great place. I’m representing my country, the country that fought for me to come back. I’m gonna represent it well.”
Griner will also be competing in Paris for the first time as a parent. She and her wife had a son, Bash, on July 8. Griner isn’t thrilled to be leaving him so soon, but said since he’s growing up in a sports family, one day he’ll understand.

“Every minute I feel like he’s popping into my head,” Griner said. “Literally everything revolves around him. And I love it.”
Griner says the upcoming games will “100% mean more” than her previous Olympic experiences, adding that she will be playing for the country that “literally saved my life.”
The Paris games will be the first time Griner has left the country since her Russian detainment. In February 2022, she was arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges after vape cartridges were found in her luggage at the airport. She was eventually tried, found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison. Griner returned to the U.S. in December 2022 after a prisoner exchange between the two countries.
Since then, she has resumed her WNBA career and continued to thrive. Griner was a WNBA All-Star in 2023 and again this year, currently averaging 18.3 points and 6.4 rebounds a night for the Phoenix Mercury. 
Already a two-time Olympic gold medalist, Griner expects to bring home one more from Paris. As for what else about the games excites her, she expects to watch a good amount of track and field, a sport she’s always been envious of. She’ll also be hanging out in the basketball players’ lounge, possibly challenging some players from the men’s team to games of Uno.
And of course, Griner knows what she’s most interested in exploring during her first trip to Paris.

NBC_30,California fire outlook grows more worrisome after heat dries out tall grass fed by winter rain,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/california-fire-season-risk-heat-dried-tall-grass-rcna162341,2024-07-20 04:02:02.845041,,"With weeks still to go before the heart of fire season hits, more than 242,000 acres have already burned in California — about double the typical area for this time of year, according to statistics from the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
The number of fires that have started so far is typical for this period of the summer, but intense early summer heat waves have dried out the landscape and raised the wildfire risk, turning a seasonal outlook that had looked relatively rosy into a major question mark. 
“The wildfire situation throughout the West has continued to escalate, and unfortunately I think will escalate considerably further in the days to come,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in a briefing Thursday. “The last 30 days have been the warmest period on record for a very large portion of California and the West.” 
More than 2,000 firefighters are assigned to the Lake Fire northwest of Santa Barbara, which started July 5 and took off quickly in tall grass. It has grown to more than 38,000 acres and is now 73% contained. Another 2,900 firefighters are working to control the Shelly Fire, which has burned more than 15,000 acres on the eastern side of the Klamath National Forest. 
Because California experienced two consecutive wet winters, the National Interagency Fire Center had predicted modest fire activity in the state this summer and fall. But the agency upgraded its seasonal forecast this month, saying the heat had rapidly cured grasses that grew high during the rainy weather. 
“We’ve had, you know, two actually really great winters where we’ve had atmospheric rivers come in and really help pull California out of drought. But the other side to that is that we now have a lot of extra grass and brush that has dried out and is ready to burn,” said Kaitlyn Trudeau, a senior research associate at Climate Central, a non-profit research organization.
Swain said recent outbreaks of “dry lightning” — from thunderstorms that don’t produce rains — are of particular concern, because long-term forecasts suggest another heat wave could take hold of the region in late July and amplify any existing fires. 
A recent analysis from the satellite-monitoring company Maxar suggests that soil moisture levels cratered in California from the beginning of June to July 15, and that temperatures in the same period have run about 5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than in 2020. 
That year, California entered the month of June with a similar drought outlook and profile of wildfire risk to that of this year. Then, more than 10,000 lightning strikes hammered California over three days in mid-August, sparking dozens of fires. Spurred on by a heat wave, many of these blazes grew quickly and eventually burned together into three separate complex fires. One of those, the August Complex, mostly affected Mendocino National Forest and alone burned more than 1 million acres.
 In all, 33 people in California were killed in the 2020 wildfires and 4.5 million acres burned.
“It’s really concerning to see these statistics because we’re really only in the middle of July. And when we think about the huge lightning storm in 2020, that was in August,” Trudeau said of this year’s early data. “We’re already starting to see some dry lightning storms. So we really have a long way to go to finish out this year.”
Across the United States, more than a million acres have burned so far this year in total, and 54 large fires are currently being suppressed, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. 
The wildfire season is off to an early and busy start in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Oregon, which has several large fires burning in remote areas.  
Almost 1,600 firefighters are working to contain the 114,000-acre Falls Fire in eastern Oregon, and another 600 were battling the 83,000-acre Lone Rock Fire in the central part of the state, about 40 miles south of the Columbia River. Another blaze — the Cow Valley Fire — has  burned more than 130,000 acres near the Oregon-Idaho border. 
Meanwhile, a small wildfire ignited by lightning shut down Highway 20 in northern Washington state Thursday. Elsewhere in the state, smoke from the Pioneer Fire, along the eastern shore of Lake Chelan, was making air quality unhealthy in the area. 
As of Tuesday, more personnel had been deployed to address wildfires than in any of the past five years, according to National Interagency Fire Center data. Evan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

NBC_31,"Family of boy who drowned in a 'borrow pit' calls for more arrests after boys, 10 and 11, are charged",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-boy-drowned-borrow-pit-calls-arrests-10-11-year-old-are-charged-rcna162536,2024-07-20 04:00:02.845041,,"It took 55 days to confirm what Noah Bush’s family had known for weeks. His death was not an accident, as authorities had initially insisted.
Now the family of the 8-year-old Georgia boy who drowned in a construction pit in May is calling for more arrests and a deeper investigation into the child’s death, which has been ruled a homicide, their attorney said. 
Two boys, ages 10 and 11, have been arrested and charged in Noah’s death. But an attorney for the family, Francys Johnson, said the Bushes are calling for the arrest of any adults who may have had a role in covering up the boys’ actions and criticized a sheriff’s department that for weeks said Noah’s death was an accident.
Noah was found dead May 16, a day after he was reported missing, in a borrow pit filled with water near his home in Jesup, Georgia, law enforcement and Johnson have said. A borrow pit is an area where material like dirt or soil has been dug out for use at another site.
He was last seen hanging out with a 10-year-old, whom he had known for a few months and considered a friend, and an 11-year-old he’d met that day, Johnson said.
“At some point, they pressured Noah to go down to the borrow pit,” said Johnson, who has met with the district attorney and viewed the evidence. 
“It’s a deep, canyon-like place. And in the low places, water fills up in it, like swimming-pool sizes of water,” he said, adding that the area is in “total disrepair” with fences and gates broken down, allowing access to people.
Johnson said an argument ensued between the boys, and he “was pushed into the water by the older juvenile.”
The sheriff’s department said at the time that his death was an accident and that no foul play was involved. But family members disputed that finding, arguing that Noah was afraid of water and would not have gone near it, according to NBC affiliate First Coast News. Hundreds of people protested the department’s findings in the days after Noah’s death.
“She always believed that there was more to this,” Johnson said of Noah’s mother. “I don’t know if I recall anybody who’s been more regretful that they were right.”
The sheriff’s office reversed course nearly two months after the boy was found dead, saying in a news release that Noah’s death had been ruled a homicide after it was discovered during the investigation that one of the boys “pushed him into the deep portion of the borrow pit they were wading in.” The Wayne County Coroner’s Office did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding Noah’s autopsy.
The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Johnson's allegations.
The two boys were arrested July 10 in connection with Noah’s drowning, the sheriff’s department said in a statement. The 11-year-old has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, simple battery, concealing the death of another and criminal trespass, while the 10-year is charged with concealing the death of another and criminal trespass. The boys have not been publicly named because of their age.
Natalie Hardison, the mother of one of the boys, was also arrested on July 10 on a felony charge of making false statements, as well as a probation and truancy charge, both misdemeanors, according to the sheriff’s office. Chief Deputy Mike Hargrove, of the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, said Hardison had ""lied"" about her whereabouts at one point during the investigation. Hardison has remained jailed since her arrest, according to the sheriff’s office’s website. There is no attorney listed for her in court records.
The arrests of the boys came 55 days after Noah's body was found.
“The sheriff had the statements of these boys from within 48 hours of Noah’s drowning. So to let this mother be led to believe that this was an accidental drowning for that long and to not inform the community is just really hard,” Johnson said. 
Noah “was the real center of his family’s joy” and “full of life,” Johnson told NBC News. His death has left Noah’s mother, Demetrice Bush, heartbroken and searching for answers, he said.
Johnson described the area as a “tight-knit” but impoverished trailer-home community.
“Noah’s family didn’t come from any great means, but neither are the people who are accused of his manslaughter,” Johnson said.
Noahs’ mother believes the sheriff’s office almost overlooked her son’s death as a homicide and criticized the sheriff’s office’s handling of the investigation, Johnson said
“It is her belief that, ultimately, her child didn’t matter to them,” he said.
Noah was Black. Johnson said the two boys who were arrested are white.
The sheriff’s department did not respond to questions from NBC News about the family's allegations.
“There may be others who are involved in concealing the actions of the 10 and 11 year old and everyone who was involved in that, who was a party to those crimes, should be held to account,” Johnson said. 
But he said the family is grateful to the local district attorney for ultimately deciding that the two boys and one of their mothers should face charges. The Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney said it does not comment on ongoing prosecutions. 
Hargrove said the investigation is ongoing.

NBC_32,Democrats rush to decide Biden’s political future before it plunges into murky legal territory,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/democrats-rush-decide-bidens-political-future-plunges-murky-legal-terr-rcna162486,2024-07-20 04:00:02.845041,,"The Democratic pressure campaign to convince President Joe Biden to get off the ticket is rushing to get ahead of deadlines that would turn a political fight into a legal one, due to state laws on ballot certification and vacancies. 
Democrats are still on course to formally nominate the president again during the first week of August at a virtual delegate roll call vote before their convention later that month. And while party rules provide a clear path for Democrats to replace Biden before or after that vote, a decision to replace him for political reasons later than that gets into thorny territory, effectively becoming a lost cause by early September.
In short, Democrats may have only days after their convention to finalize their nominee or else they risk being left off the ballot in key states, risking key Electoral College votes and their ability to win the presidency along with it. By early September, trying to put a new presidential candidate on the ballot is no longer solely up to a national party once state laws on ballot certification and ballot vacancies go into effect.
“The sooner it happens, the less fraught the situation will be,” said Rebecca Green, an associate director of law and co-director of the Election Law Program at the William & Mary Law School. 
“It is generally the case that parties have flexibility to replace candidates until the ballots are printed,” Green, who is also a member of the National Task Force on Election Crises, continued. After that, she added, “things get more difficult because you’re running up against state laws.” 
Many state deadlines aren’t until closer to the election, and many state laws are more flexible governing vacancies on a ticket in the case of a serious illness or death. 
But swapping out the presidential nominee for political reasons after early September would jeopardize a party’s ability to win states with stricter laws, such as Maine and Wisconsin — both of which are likely must-wins for Democrats — and others the later a potential vacancy were to occur. 
Some election experts, both nonpartisan and Democratic-aligned, say they feel confident that the party could overcome legal challenges in the courts and with the help of friendly state legislatures. But several battleground states are controlled by conservatives who might be less interested in helping Democrats manage a political crisis. And conservatives are already spinning up an effort to fight in court over a potential attempt to replace Biden, while Democrats are already planning to retool their nominating process to sidestep legal questions in at least one state, a clear sign that they don’t want to leave things to chance. 
With electoral college margins as tight as they are for Democrats, an attempt to replace Biden in the weeks after the convention could risk the presidential race entirely. 
Party rules make it virtually impossible to replace Biden unless he steps aside. But some Democratic leaders have been delivering “blunt” messages to Biden about his political standing and the broader implications for the party if he remains the nominee.
If Biden were to step aside now, it could get messy, but the rules are clear: Whoever wins the majority of the voting convention delegates wins the nomination. 
If Biden dropped out of the race after being formally named the nominee, the rules cover that, too. A group of Democratic Party leaders would meet to recommend a replacement, and under current rules, a majority of Democratic National Committee members — not convention delegates — would need to vote to approve it. 
But once state ballot certification and printing deadlines come into play, that whole process gets remarkably more complicated — particularly after a convention toward the end of August.
Each state has different rules governing when its general election ballot is certified; what, if any, scenarios allow for a party to replace its nominee on that ballot; and even whether a candidate who has withdrawn (or died) is eligible to win votes at all. 
On top of that, there’s another complicating factor: “faithless electors” laws on the books in more than 30 states and the District of Columbia. 
Those laws were generally written to ensure that the voters in the Electoral College, which technically elects the president, reflect the will of the people in each state, so the electors can’t freelance by voting for someone else. In some cases, these laws could provide a lifeline for a political party whose presidential candidate couldn’t be placed on the ballot in time. But in others, the law could prevent a presidential elector from voting for anyone except their party’s listed candidate on the ballot — even if that candidate has already withdrawn from the race. 
It’s a complicated tapestry of state laws — some clear, some less so, and many of them untested in court, particularly for such a weighty scenario. And while a tragedy like a candidate dying or becoming incapacitated would provide a party with more wiggle room, there’s less flexibility in state law for a party to replace a nominee late in the game for political reasons only. 
Take Maine, for example, where state law says a general election candidate can’t be replaced within 70 days of an election — Aug. 27 this year — except in the case of catastrophic illness or death. Maine laws governing presidential electors don’t clearly give those electors freedom to vote for a replacement candidate if the original one wasn’t on the ballot. Altogether, that means any attempt to replace a nominee for political reasons after that 70-day cutoff point could jeopardize a party’s ability to win Maine’s Electoral College votes. 
“If the president is going to step aside, it would just go a lot more smoothly if he were to step out ahead of the convention,” said Daniel Walker, a Maine-based election lawyer who works with Democrats.
Walker added he believed that in the hypothetical where Democrats replaced their nominee for political reasons after Maine’s deadline, the party would have potential legislative or legal options to get them on the ballot. But he acknowledged those options would would likely spark legal challenges.
In Wisconsin, the deadline for political parties to certify the names of their presidential candidates is Sept. 3. After that, the state code says “the name of that person shall appear upon the ballot except in case of death of the person.” And while the state law governing presidential electors doesn’t require an elector to vote for a candidate who has since died, it again raises serious questions about whether presidential electors can vote for a replacement nominee who wasn’t properly replaced on Wisconsin ballots, and an attempt to swap a candidate out after that date for a reason other than death would, again, spark near-certain lawsuits.  
Both states are likely necessary for any Democrat on the path to the 270 Electoral College votes, and there are plausible scenarios in which losing Maine’s four Electoral College votes keeps a Democrat just shy of the winning threshold. 
Other states have deadlines later in the calendar, but some are quite rigid.
For example, Colorado allows for a withdrawal and replacement of a nominee until the “earliest day to mail general election ballots” in October. Any withdrawal after that date would lead to votes cast for that candidate being deemed invalid. 
In Virginia, nominees can be replaced up to 60 days before a general election (or 25 days in the case of death). But presidential electors appear to be required to vote for the nominee on the ballot pursuant to those rules, so a late withdrawal would jeopardize the ability to win here, too. 
Any attempt to replace the nominee later in September would also risk running into federal law, which requires ballots be sent to U.S. military and overseas voters by Sept. 21, adding another legal wrinkle. 
Ultimately, it’s likely that an attempt to replace a nominee for political reasons, and possibly for legitimate health reasons, too, would almost certainly lead to widespread and unpredictable lawsuits in states across the country that could wind up at the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority. 
Depending on the specific circumstances, Democrats would likely mount a massive legal effort aimed at ensuring their replacement nominee has the ballot access required to win the presidency, and Republican groups like the Heritage Foundation have made clear they’d mount a similar legal effort in response.

NBC_33,Steve Kornacki: A party can get it wrong — and has before,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/steve-kornacki-biden-pressure-party-can-get-wrong-rcna162783,2024-07-20 05:00:02.903464,,"Battleground polls look bad. Forecasting models are gloomier. States assumed to be safely in their column now seem in play.
The realization that their presidential candidate has no realistic path to victory is sweeping the party. Panicked leaders are speaking out, more and more by the hour. Dozens are now publicly demanding their candidate exit the race. And the other party is licking its chops, thinking big not just about a win but about a landslide up and down the ballot. 
It’s happening now with Democrats and President Joe Biden, yes, but it’s also happened before. It was eight Octobers ago when Republicans erupted in panic at the latest — and most dramatic, to date — uproar around their nominee, Donald Trump. The release of the “Access Hollywood” tape convinced scores of major Republicans that Trump’s path to victory had gone from small to nonexistent, and a frantic 36-hour push to dislodge him from the top of the ticket ensued. You know the rest. 
How and why Trump prevailed, even after his party’s leaders disowned him, is worth keeping in mind as (at least as of this writing) Biden refuses to relent to similar pressure.
There will always be debate over what exactly put Trump over the top, but however you arrive at it, one critical variable does stand out: his opponent’s profound unpopularity. 
From the early days of the 2016 race until the end, barely 40% of voters expressed favorable views of Hillary Clinton. For the entire general election campaign, even as Trump paraded from one scandal and inflammatory eruption to another, Clinton proved stubbornly incapable of even reaching 50% support in the national poll averages. In the exit poll, 61% deemed her dishonest and untrustworthy. A majority said they would be “scared” or “concerned” if she were president.
In all of these areas, Trump’s numbers were just as bad. And in other areas, they were far worse. On Election Day, 61% of voters said Trump was unqualified to serve as president. Even more, 63%, said he lacked the basic temperament for the job. And 70% said his treatment of women bothered them. 
These were all supposed to be threshold questions. After all, who would say they dislike a candidate and that the candidate is unqualified, unfit and dishonest — and then vote for that candidate anyway? Trump owes his 2016 victory to a not insubstantial number of voters who did just that. That’s how unacceptable they deemed the alternative to be.
The hope for Biden, in the event he remains a candidate, is that Trump serves as the Hillary Clinton of 2024: an opponent so objectionable to so many voters that a critical chunk of them ultimately side with Biden, even while believing that the incumbent lacks some of the most basic attributes needed in a president. 
While Biden is by no means in a good position in current public polling, the numbers hardly rule out this possibility. 
Our latest NBC News poll, released early this week, offers a set of findings for Biden that are, by any historical standard, grim. Among registered voters, 58% disapprove his job performance, 53% have a negative personal view of him and 65% say his physical and mental health represents a “major” concern. Only 33% of Democrats say they’re satisfied with him as their party’s nominee. 
And yet, in our poll, Biden still trails Trump by just 2 points, 45%-43%. That’s the same deficit he faced in our previous poll, back in April. And it comes weeks after his horrendous debate showing and amidst increasingly harsh criticism from his own party. 
It suggests that, as shocking as Biden’s public performance was for many of his allies, most Americans had long ago recognized and processed his decline. Earlier polling data backs that up. And many of those voters had also long ago concluded that they’d still prefer a clearly diminished Biden to another Trump term. Notably, Trump’s negative rating in our poll is 53%, the same as Biden’s. It certainly seems that Trump’s very real weaknesses are at least keeping Biden in the game.
Now, there’s always a “to be sure” section in an analysis like this, so here it goes. To be sure, we don’t yet know the full political effect of the GOP convention or the Trump shooting. It could be that Trump actually grows his support to new levels and gains significant new popularity. If that were to happen, any comparison to Clinton in 2016 would collapse.
It’s also true Trump already enjoyed a substantial Electoral College advantage in both 2016 and 2020, when he lost the popular vote by millions of votes. Based on that, the fact that Trump is ahead by any margin in national polling — something that was essentially never the case in the previous two elections — would seem to suggest that he’s not just ahead but far ahead in the battlegrounds. And, indeed, recent swing state polling has generally been more favorable to Trump than national polling. 
But there’s also reason to suspect that Trump’s Electoral College advantage will be significantly reduced, maybe even eliminated, this time around, due to the changing nature of his demographic coalition. If true, then a small Trump lead in national polling wouldn’t be as dire for Biden. And while there are some high-quality swing state surveys now in circulation, state-level data from well-established pollsters is much less abundant than at the national level.
It can’t be underscored enough: Biden’s position in polling is not good at all. But a lesson from Trump’s 2016 victory is that, if antipathy toward the alternative is intense enough, voters will stretch the limits of what they are ultimately willing to accept far beyond anything previously understood to be the case. Whether that could actually include re-electing a president they don’t believe has the basic fitness for the job remains to be seen — maybe. Steve Kornacki, author of ""The Red and the Blue: 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism,"" is a national political correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC."

More than three weeks after President Joe Biden’s debate debacle, the chorus of Democrats calling on him to exit the 2024 race is only growing louder. Publicly, Biden is remaining defiant, while privately, his family is discussing what ending his re-election bid might look like. And Vice President Kamala Harris’ allies are beginning to map out a potential campaign if she were to take over the top of the party’s ticket.
Here’s the state of play as of Friday evening:
Mounting pressure: Thirteen more congressional Democrats called on Biden to drop out of the presidential race today, bringing the total to 35, Scott Wong, Ali Vitali and Rebecca Kaplan report.
The new defections include two close allies of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Jared Huffman and Zoe Lofgren of California, and two senators, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio (first reported by Henry J. Gomez) and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
Brown in particular is significant, as he is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats seeking re-election this year.
Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts re-upped his call for Biden to exit in a Boston Globe op-ed, writing that the president “didn’t seem to recognize me” at a D-Day event in Normandy last month. 
But Biden also received a boost from Capitol Hill today, as BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, endorsed his campaign. 
Public defiance, private discussions: Biden continues to be sidelined as he deals with Covid (White House physician Kevin O’Connor said his symptoms have “improved meaningfully“ since yesterday). But his campaign was still plenty active — and the president pledged to be back in action soon.
Biden attacked former President Donald Trump’s GOP convention speech, saying in a statement this afternoon that he looked “forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week.” In a new memo, his campaign said the party has “no plan for an alternative nominee.” And campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to relay the message that Biden is “absolutely” still in the race. “He’s not going anywhere,” she said.  
In an all-staff campaign call this afternoon, O’Malley Dillon encouraged her team to focus on the work and the voters who are voicing support for the president, Mike Memoli reports. 
The Democratic National Committee also carried on with business as usual, moving forward with the plan to nominate Biden via a virtual roll call in early August. Ben Kamisar and Alex Seitz-Wald note that while party rules provide a clear path for Democrats to replace Biden before or after that vote, a decision to replace him for political reasons later than that gets into thorny territory, effectively becoming a lost cause by early September. 
Privately, however, members of Biden’s family have discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like, Carol E. Lee, Monica Alba, Sarah Fitzpatrick, Jonathan Allen and Natasha Korecki report.
The overall tone of the conversations has been that any departure plan — should Biden decide to take that step, as some of his closest allies increasingly believe he will — should put the party in the best position to beat Trump while also being worthy of the more than five decades he has served the country in elected office.  
Harris in the spotlight: A group of Democrats who believe Harris should be the party’s nominee if Biden steps aside have begun quietly mapping out what her presidential campaign apparatus would look like and what her path to victory could be in November, reports Yamiche Alcindor. 
 The effort, which Harris has not sanctioned, comes as many are concerned that the vice president does not currently have the personnel or organization needed to quickly make the pivot to the top of the ticket.
Harris held a call with major Democratic donors this afternoon, expressing confidence that she and Biden will win the election, Vitali and Alba report. She also made a Biden-esque move earlier in the afternoon, making a stop at a new ice cream shop in Washington, D.C., owned by Tyra Banks.

Six weeks ago, it seemed fairly clear the country was uninterested in the Biden-Trump rematch. Even the ratings for the first debate, consequential though it was, were shockingly low. At 51 million viewers, it was the lowest-rated first general election debate for a presidential race since we started tracking TV viewership for these things. 
Polling also indicated lower interest in this campaign and an extreme distaste for the choices the two major parties were offering. North of 50% of voters were regularly saying they’d like to see anyone other than these two run for president. 
In short, voters were telling us in all sorts of ways that this matchup was one they didn’t want and they weren’t going to tune in to — until, perhaps, the last possible minute. After all, these two candidates, as far as voters were concerned, were well defined. What new information would voters think they needed?  
Well, there’s a reason we political reporters like to utter the cliché that sometimes a month (or a week) is a lifetime in politics. Because right now, we’re in the midst of experiencing a second or a third lifetime politically, just since that June 27 debate.
We are now going from a presidential campaign that left the public disinterested and at times disgusted to a campaign that I could see generating an electorate that might be as interested, if not more so, as in 2008 and 2020, two of the highest-turnout elections in the last 50 years. 
And the more the public tunes in, the more volatile this election could become again.
Before the assassination attempt, there wasn’t a scenario in which I believed Trump could persuade skeptics to give him a second look, let alone win over voters who decided not to support him in 2020 — especially after his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, in particular. And perhaps he still won’t be able to win these folks over. But I do have a feeling that these skeptics will be curious enough about whether Saturday changed Trump to at least check him out, maybe by tuning into some of Thursday’s acceptance speech. And that’s an opportunity.
Meanwhile, if the Democrats do end up with a new nominee — and it’s looking more likely by the hour that they will — that, too, is likely to suddenly trigger interest in what the new nominee has to say, which in turn could engage the electorate in a way that the pre-debate version of this campaign just didn’t.
Bottom line: We are getting awfully close to the moment when it might be fair to say, “Throw out everything you thought you knew about this election.”

Battleground polls look bad. Forecasting models are gloomier. States assumed to be safely in their column now seem in play. 
The realization that their presidential candidate has no realistic path to victory is sweeping the party. Panicked leaders are speaking out, more and more by the hour. Dozens are now publicly demanding their candidate exit the race. And the other party is licking its chops, thinking big not just about a win but about a landslide up and down the ballot.
It’s happening now with Democrats and Biden, yes, but it’s also happened before. It was eight Octobers ago when Republicans erupted in panic at the latest — and most dramatic, to date — uproar around their nominee. The release of the “Access Hollywood” tape convinced scores of major Republicans that Trump’s path to victory had gone from small to nonexistent, and a frantic 36-hour push to dislodge him from the top of the ticket ensued. You know the rest. 
How and why Trump prevailed, even after his party’s leaders disowned him, is worth keeping in mind as Biden refuses to relent to similar pressure.
There will always be debate over what exactly put Trump over the top, but however you arrive at it, one critical variable does stand out: his opponent’s profound unpopularity.

NBC_35,Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown calls for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ohio-sen-sherrod-brown-calls-biden-drop-2024-race-rcna162804,2024-07-20 07:18:03.062297,,"Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio called on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign Friday, becoming the fourth Democrat in the chamber to ask Biden to drop out of the race.
“Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban,” Brown said in a written statement shared first with NBC News. “These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them.”
“I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me,” Brown added. “At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.”
Brown’s call follows one Thursday from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who, like Brown, faces a tough re-election campaign this fall, and another Friday from Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., urged Biden to withdraw from the race last week. More than 30 congressional Democrats now want someone other than Biden to be their party’s presidential nominee.
The push for Biden to exit comes after a debate performance with Trump last month that raised alarms about the president’s age and health — and about his ability to lead the Democratic ticket this fall. The push has intensified in recent days, with speculation increasing about Vice President Kamala Harris and others stepping in for Biden.
Brown, according to his campaign, will not weigh in on the process to choose a new Democratic nominee and believes Biden should serve the rest of his term.
The three-term Ohio senator had previously said that voters in his state, which former President Donald Trump twice won by 8 percentage points, had “legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign” and that he intended to listen to their concerns. But he had stopped short of calling for Biden to end his re-election bid. 
Brown’s Trump-endorsed Republican challenger, businessman Bernie Moreno, has been linking him closely to Biden’s struggles for weeks.
Moreno, reacting to Brown’s announcement later Friday, asserted that his opponent had not gone far enough.
“If Joe Biden is unfit to run, he is unfit to serve,” Moreno said in an emailed statement from his campaign. “I am formally calling on Joe Biden to resign the Presidency because his continued presence in the situation room is a national security threat. I hope Senator Brown will join me.”Henry J. Gomez is a senior national political reporter for NBC News"
NBC_36,Zuckerberg praises Trump's response to assassination attempt,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-praises-trumps-response-assassination-attempt-rcna162777,2024-07-20 06:00:03.062297,,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praised Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s response to nearly being assassinated, calling his raised fist after the incident “one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life.” 
In an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, Zuckerberg declined to endorse a presidential candidate and said he would not play ""a significant role in the election.” 
But Zuckerberg went on to offer positive characterizations of Trump. 
“At some level as an American, it’s hard to not, like, get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight,” Zuckerberg said about Trump’s response to the shooting. “And I think that’s why a lot of people like the guy.”
Meta did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment.
Zuckerberg has faced criticism and scrutiny from both Trump and President Joe Biden.
Zuckerberg’s comments about Trump come days after Trump suggested that he didn’t want to ban TikTok because Zuckerberg’s social media platforms would benefit.  
“If you don’t have TikTok, you have Facebook and Instagram, and that’s, you know, that’s Zuckerberg,” Trump said. 
Trump has attacked Zuckerberg several times over the years. On Trump’s own social media platform, Truth Social, Trump recently threatened to send “ZUCKERBUCKS” to prison if he were elected president. 
Trump has also claimed that Zuckerberg has praised him in private. “Last week, the weirdo — he’s a weirdo — Mark Zuckerberg came to the White House, kissed my ass all night,” Trump said at a 2022 rally, according to Business Insider. 
Facebook and Instagram reinstated Trump’s accounts last year after he was previously suspended following the Jan. 6 insurrection. 
Zuckerberg has supported Republicans in the past. In 2013, Zuckerberg hosted a fundraiser for then-governor of New Jersey Chris Christie, who ran unsuccessfully in this year’s Republican primary.  
But during the 2020 election cycle, Zuckerberg donated $350 million to local election offices, a move that some Republicans accused of helping get President Joe Biden elected. In the 2022 midterms, the nonprofit that distributed the money said that it wouldn’t disburse similar donations anymore.  
Biden has also voiced criticism about the tech titan. “I’ve never been a big Zuckerberg fan,” Biden told The New York Times while running for president in 2020. “I think he’s a real problem.”
Since the assassination attempt and Biden’s poor performance in the first debate, Trump has received a series of high-profile nods and endorsements. X owner Elon Musk offered his official endorsement of Trump just moments after the shooting.  
“I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk posted on Saturday. Victoria Feng is an intern on the NBC News technology desk."

Delegates and guests attending the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Wisconsin are making predictions about President Biden's political future amid reports he is closer to exiting the 2024 presidential race.
Fox News Digital spoke with multiple RNC attendees outside Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, the site of the convention, and most felt Biden would ultimately drop his re-election bid but that it would matter little when the votes are finally counted.
""I think [former President] Trump's going to mop the floor with anybody they put up,"" one attendee said, adding that it seemed Biden was ""on the way out the door.""

""I don't think it really matters. I think whoever they have, their bench is kind of shallow and weak right now.""
Another attendee told Fox he felt vindicated after predicting months earlier Biden wasn't going to end up being the Democrat presidential nominee.
""I think Saturday may have changed things slightly, but I doubt it,"" he said, referencing the failed assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. ""The globalists have a mission. They don't care anymore about Joe Biden. … I don't think it matters who they run. I don't think they have a shot to win a legitimate election at this point.""

Others also predicted Biden would drop out, but some expressed hope he would stay in the race or thought that Democrats couldn't afford to dump him from the ticket so close to the election.
""They bet with him, and they keep telling us how far ahead in the polls he is, so they need to keep backing him all the way. I think it'd be disastrous if they change right now,"" she said.
""I think he understands, and his compatriots understand, he needs to drop out. So, I think he will. I have no idea who they're going to put up, you know, to replace him. I would hope it wouldn't be Kamala, but I have no idea,"" another said.

One attendee said it would be ""totally fine"" if Vice President Harris became the nominee or even California Gov. Gavin Newsom or former first lady Michelle Obama. ""The people, I think, are waking up to know that that's just not the party of the people anymore. So, it doesn't matter.""
The attendees also unanimously praised Trump's vice presidential running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, after his Wednesday convention speech, calling him ""empathetic,"" ""high energy"" and ""relatable.""

Reuters reported Thursday that Biden is now ""soul-searching"" about the future of his candidacy, citing sources familiar with the matter, while NBC News reported a source close to the president as saying, ""We’re close to the end.""
The reports come after previous reporting from the Washington Post that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Biden he would lose and push the House of Representatives further under Republican control. The Post also reported that former President Obama told his allies that Biden needed to reconsider his candidacy.

FOX_2,Kevin McCarthy says Matt Gaetz should get professional help after viral spat: 'He looks very unhinged',https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mccarthy-says-matt-gaetz-should-get-professional-help-after-viral-spat-he-looks-very-unhinged,2024-07-19 08:00:04.550728,politics,"Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy returned fire after Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., crashed his live CNN interview. 
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., should get professional help the morning after his rival video-bombed his live interview on CNN during the Republican National Convention. 
""You know, he looks very unhinged,"" McCarthy said about Gaetz on Thursday. ""I mean, a lot of people have concerns about him, and I'm not sure if he's on something, but I do hope he gets the help that he needs. But more importantly, I hope that young women get the justice they deserve when it comes to him."" 
McCarthy was referring to a House Ethics Committee probe into allegations Gaetz ""engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct."" The committee also noted that Gaetz denies all allegations. 
The comments on Gaetz being purportedly ""unhinged"" followed the Florida lawmaker mocking McCarthy during a live CNN broadcast.

""What night are you speaking? Are you speaking tonight?"" Gaetz mocked as McCarthy was not on the roster. 
""[The] person who raised the issue, he‘s got an ethics complaint about paying, sleeping with a 17-year-old. That‘s the way they would go, so that‘s the biggest challenge we have,"" McCarthy said during the CNN interview, referring to Gaetz while ignoring his taunts.
""If you took that stage you would get booed off of it,"" Gaetz added. 
Gaetz and McCarthy have had an infamously tumultuous relationship. McCarthy alleged on CNN that Gaetz had asked him to make the ethics probe go away, and then initiated a bipartisan effort to get him struck from being House speaker. 
PELOSI ‘CONVINCED BIDEN WILL LOSE,’ WORKING THE PHONES WITH HOPES TO ‘EASE HIM OFF THE TICKET,’ REPORT SAYS
Gaetz filed a ""motion to vacate"" in October, accusing McCarthy of poor leadership, cooperating with Democrats and abandoning conservative ideals. The House voted 216-210 in favor of the motion, marking the first time in U.S. history that a sitting speaker was removed by such a vote.

""We're concerned about the future of the conservative agenda in the House,"" Gaetz said at the time. ""I would say that the conservative agenda was being paralyzed by Speaker McCarthy.""
McCarthy called the small Republican coalition that joined Democrats in removing him ""The Gaetz Eight.""
""What Matt Gaetz did has broken the Republican majority. He's now created ‘Lord of the Flies.’ Ask anybody inside our conference; they actually know it,"" he said. 
Two months after his historic ouster as U.S. Speaker of the House, McCarthy announced he would be resigning by December 2023.

BIDEN INTERVIEWERS SHED LIGHT ON HIS FRAILTY BEHIND THE SCENES: ‘IT’S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE'
Gaetz has been under a years-long House ethics investigation, spurred by the Department of Justice (DOJ), looking into reports in early 2021 that he had a relationship with an underage girl. The DOJ declined to charge Gaetz in 2023.
Gaetz denies all allegations.

As MSNBC host Rachel Maddow fretted about Sen. JD Vance being former President Trump’s choice for vice president, she complained about how ""Lord of the Rings"" is loved by the far-right. 
On day three of the Republican National Convention, Maddow commented about Vance's ties to former PayPal CEO and Republican donor Peter Thiel, who she noted ""has named his companies after things in the Lord of the Rings series of J.R.R. Tolkien books."" 
""Lord of the Rings is a sort of favorite cosmos for naming things and cultural references for a lot of far-right and alt-right figures, both in Europe and the United States. Peter Thiel names all these things after Tolkien figures in places like his company Palantir, for example,"" Maddow said. 
WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT JD VANCE: FROM BESTSELLING AUTHOR TO TRUMP'S VP PICK
As MSNBC host Rachel Maddow fretted about JD Vance being Trump’s VP, she argued that the name of his venture capital firm is part of a sinister trend. 
LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION
""Like his mentor, like Peter Thiel, who had given him all his jobs in the world, Mr. Vance also when he founded his own venture capital firm with help from Peter Thiel, named it after a Lord of the Rings thing. He called it Narya, N-A-R-Y-A, which you can remember because it’s ‘Aryan,’ but you move the n to the front,"" she continued. ""Apparently that word has something to do with elves and rings from the Lord of the Rings series, I don’t know.""
While the MSNBC host appeared to try to draw a parallel between Narya, the venture capital firm, and ""Aryan"" an archaic term that has been associated with far-right racial ideology, Narya is named after one of the rings of power in the Lord of the Rings lore, specifically the ring of fire bestowed to elven kings.

Ex-MSNBC host Keith Olbermann called for CNN to fire one of their most prominent political commentators for juxtaposing former President Trump and President Biden in a way that put the Republican in a positive light.
In the weeks following Biden’s widely criticized performance in the presidential debate, the president’s supporters have feuded with his critics who are calling for him to step down in lieu of another candidate.
In the past week, Trump narrowly avoided death by an attempted assassin while Biden caught COVID-19, a pair of events CNN’s Van Jones addressed Wednesday night. 
""Today is a terrible day. If you pull back and look at this thing: strength versus weakness. A bullet couldn‘t stop Trump. A virus just stopped Biden,"" the former Obama adviser said.

Now, the election may already be over",https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-did-something-hes-never-done-before-rnc-speech-now-election-may-already-over,2024-07-19 13:40:41.425000,opinion,"Former President Trump speaks at the Republican National Convention about the attempt on his life.
Donald Trump may well have sealed the outcome of the 2024 election with a performance on Thursday night in Milwaukee that has largely been unmatched in recent American political history.
The former president eschewed the polarization and division that has marked much of his rhetoric in the past. In his speech officially accepting the Republican Party's nomination there were only a couple of references to the 2020 election. Trump was able to hit on key messages when speaking about topics like inflation, and especially immigration, in ways that were compelling and arguably responsive to the fundamental concerns of Americans.
I say this not to engage in hyperbole, as I have never been -- and am not now -- a Trump supporter. But as a political analyst, you have to acknowledge reality. And the reality of this speech was simple: Trump spoke of the American Dream, he spoke of bringing people together, he spoke of helping African-Americans, Hispanics and those who have been left behind. 
In short, Trump did something he has virtually never done before: speak to all the American people. As he said, he wanted to speak not to 50 percent but to 100 percent of the American people. 
TRUMP PREACHES UNITY AS HE ACCEPTS GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION DAYS AFTER SURVIVING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
Trump also understood that this was not a time to attack President Joe Biden personally or even by name. His one reference to Biden was an aside to let the crowd in Milwaukee, and indeed around the country, know what he was thinking at a time when the incumbent president is still reeling from his poor debate performance and from COVID, not to make him appear like a victim. Rather, Trump was able to compellingly crystallize the challenges the American people have with the current administration and offer a degree of reassurance that things would be different under his leadership.
To be sure, Trump did not offer specific policy recommendations in his speech beyond closing the border and cutting taxes. But rather there was a degree of optimism and confidence in his remarks that has been noticeably absent from the darker and more pessimistic speeches the 45th president of the United States has delivered over the years.
DONALD TRUMP OFFICIALLY ACCEPTS GOP NOMINATION FOR POTUS, RECOUNTS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
He also, in a way that was tasteful and empathetic, spoke about what happened to him last Saturday in Butler Township, Pa. He discussed his experience of the assassination attempt in a way that had me on the edge of my chair, even though I knew the story quite well and had seen the video many times.
Put another way, the entire speech and its production made Trump much more likable and much more sympathetic than he’s ever been before. 
To be sure, circumstances, however difficult and challenging they may have been to get to this point, worked to help the former president. But, by any measure, he rose to the occasion and offered the American people something profound that has been missing under the current administration: hope, strength and a sense that the best was yet to come for our nation.
EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE TO COREY COMPERATORE DURING RNC SPEECH: 'SPIRIT THAT FORGED AMERICA'
I fully expect Trump to increase his standing in the polls as a result of this week. I say that not only because of his Thursday night address, but also because of the entire convention. It was among the best, if not the best, choreographed and produced shows I have seen in 50 years of watching American political conventions.
The effort to reach working people and those who enjoy sports like pro-wrestling and the UFC spoke to the Republicans' desire to broaden their constituency and solidify their position as the party of working Americans. 
I also believe that, if I am right, and Trump does go up in the polls after the GOP convention, the support that has been steadily eroding for Joe Biden since his terrible debate performance just three weeks ago, will only increase and the pressure on him to quit the race will be inexorable. Indeed, it already appears now to be inevitable.

It's hard to see how Joe Biden, Kamala Harris or whoever the Democratic nominee is will compete with this speech and the events of this week.  And I fully expect that the division inside the Democratic Party will only increase as a result of the success of the Republican convention. 
As an American, I’m pleased, indeed proud, that the Republicans explicitly and I think, for the first time, are seeking to unify the entire country and put aside the bitterness and resentment that has so frequently been evident.

As a Democrat, I’m not sure I know how my party will respond in a month or so to the Trump candidacy. For now, it’s enough to say that the challenges it is facing have only grown larger and more substantial after this week after a speech and convention that could only be called an unqualified success. The events and address in Milwaukee will stand up well to whatever attempts the mainstream media make to discredit Trump and his speech. (And they have already begun.) 
Some may say that Trump’s speech went on too long on Thursday night. And that may be true. But the American people, unlike political commentators, simply turn the television off, they don’t give the candidate demerits for being long-winded.

Donald J. Trump is different. His close brush with death last Saturday has changed him. As he walked into the Finserv Forum on Monday night, the first night of the GOP convention in Milwaukee, the former president was quite clearly moved by the roar of the crowd; he looked on the verge of tears. As he watched his granddaughter Kai speak on Wednesday, he was beaming from ear to ear, clearly proud as a peacock that this beautiful young woman had asked if she could speak the truth about her grandfather – what a caring and involved person he was, and how much she loved him.
And on Thursday, the last night of the convention, Trump was smiling like a kid as Hulk Hogan roared and blustered, and again when a young granddaughter came to sit on his lap. This is a Donald Trump we have never seen before. His guard was down; he was genuinely having fun, grateful perhaps to be alive.
Nothing could be more important for Candidate Trump, who has been vilified by the media for years and cast as a cartoonish, ghoulish villain. Trump emerged from the Republican convention a relatable human being, perhaps for the first time.
DONALD TRUMP OFFICIALLY ACCEPTS GOP NOMINATION FOR POTUS, RECOUNTS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
At the end of four buoyant, heartfelt and sometimes electrifying days, the Republican Party gathering came together to embrace their nominee and now officially their candidate for president of the United States. The crowd enthusiastically welcomed the arrival of former first lady Melania Trump, and also the warm-up speakers, shouting ""four more years"" with Eric Trump, rocking with Kid Rock, praying with Franklin Graham and fist-pumping with Hulk Hogan. 
But the highlight of the night was finally hearing from Donald Trump, who just a few days earlier had nearly been killed by a young man with a rifle, and who thanked God for his deliverance from that near-miss. In the hours after the shooting, the former president said he had torn up the ""very tough"" speech he had intended to deliver, and instead would be addressing the nation on the importance of bringing the country together.
That he did, at first. His early prepared remarks were pitch perfect for the moment. He talked about what he experienced at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated, and called for a moment of silence for Corey Comperatore, the volunteer fire chief who was tragically killed shielding his family from the bullets.
TRUMP DID SOMETHING HE'S NEVER DONE BEFORE WITH RNC SPEECH. NOW, THE ELECTION MAY ALREADY BE OVER
He brought, as he said, ""a message of confidence, strength, and hope."" He promised the crowd that ""Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country."" 
Further, he told his fellow Republicans, ""I am running to be president for ALL of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America."" At a time when our country appears hopelessly divided, and when the nation’s political rhetoric has become dangerously hot, it is a message voters want to hear. That was also true four years ago, when Joe Biden promised to bring the country together. That he has failed to deliver on that promise makes Trump’s pledge even more meaningful.
Trump promised to resurrect the American Dream and to bring back common sense. He vowed on Day One of his administration to rebuild our energy independence and to secure our border. He declared he would end the push for electric vehicles and slammed the UAW leadership for embracing policies which could harm their workers. He promised prosperity for the middle class. He spoke about the future with enthusiasm and optimism.

But, as he is wont to do, he went well beyond his teleprompter remarks…way beyond. Some wag tweeted: When they said ""four more years,"" Trump misunderstood.
He could not help himself. In addition to touting the many achievements of his presidency, he attacked the numerous failures and general incompetence of the current ""administration."" He had vowed he would not mention the current president by name, but slipped up once, saying the damage done by Joe Biden was ""unthinkable."" He spoke too long, went over the same issues too many times, and left his ""unity"" message hanging by a thread.
My view: he deserved to do whatever he wanted. This was his moment and it was his prerogative. Donald Trump has been through so much in the past several years: the dishonest paid-for Russia hoax, the impeachments, the bogus lawfare, the indictments and constant, relentless attacks from the establishment, the media and his political opponents. If he wanted to ramble on for an extra 20 minutes, who cares?
The convention audience did not care. They were with him throughout, happy to remember and celebrate the years when he was in the Oval Office and inflation was low, the border was secure, the world was at peace, we achieved energy independence and the economy was strong.

FOX_8,Five biggest moments of Trump’s speech to RNC,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/five-biggest-moments-trumps-speech-gop-convention,2024-07-19 16:01:02.837000,politics,"Former President Trump remembers the victims of the shooting at his Butler, Pa., rally during the Republican National Convention.
Former President Donald Trump addressed the Republican National Convention on Thursday in Milwaukee, his first speech since the assassination attempt last week -- and it had a number of major moments.
Trump paid tribute to firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in last week's assassination attempt on Trump, calling the Pennsylvania father a ""fine man.""

""Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, and seriously wounded two other great warriors.. David Dutch and James Copenhaver. I spoke to all three families of these tremendous people—our love and prayers are with them, and always will be,"" Trump said. "" Corey, a highly respected former fire chief... was accompanied by his wife Helen... and two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets... what a fine man he was.""
Trump then walked over and kissed Comperatore's firefighting helmet which was placed with his turnout coat on the stage next to the former president as a tribute before asking for a moment of silence.
""There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for others,"" Trump said. ""This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours, and this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness.""
At the beginning of the speech, Trump retold in great detail the assassination attempt against him. A somber Trump told the crowd his version of events.
""In order to see the chart, I started to turn to my right, and was ready to begin a further turn, which I’m lucky I didn’t, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me, really hard, on my right ear,"" Trump recalled. ""I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that—it can only be a bullet,'—and moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood, just blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious, that we were under attack, and in one movement, proceeded to drop to the ground.""
""There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way I felt very safe, because I had God on my side,"" Trump continued. ""The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at the very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be with you tonight.""

Despite shots ringing out at the crowded rally, attendees did not ""run for the exits or stampede,"" Trump noted, but instead ""tens of thousands of people stood by and didn’t move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely, but automatically, stood up looking for where the sniper would be, and then began pointing at him.""
Because of this, Trump said, ""many lives were saved.""
""But that isn’t the reason they didn’t move—the reason is that they knew I was in serious trouble, they saw all of the blood, and thought I was dead, and they just didn’t want to leave me, and you can see that love written all over their faces,"" he said.
""I am not supposed to be here tonight,"" Trump said, as the crowd shouted back, ""Yes you are.""
Trump took a moment out of his speech to pay tribute to his wife Melania, saying he was ""deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife.""
He then referred to her letter to America, in which she called for unity in the wake of the assassination attempt against her husband.
""I am thinking of you, now, my fellow Americans,"" she wrote. ""Dawn is here again. Let us reunite. Now.""
The former president praised the letter.
""And Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful. A letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise. I will tell you, it was beautiful,' he said.
""Some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldn't it?""

Trump displayed a chart showing the number of illegal immigrant crossings into the U.S. that had been on display during his speech in Butler, Pa., and that crucially he turned his head to look at as a gunman opened fire.
"" Last time I put up that chart, I never really got to look at it,"" he said to laughs from the crowd. ""But without that chart, I would not be here today.""
""I said ‘you got to see this chart’. I was so proud of it. And by the time I got to there, I never got to see it that day. But I'm seeing it now, and I was very proud.""
Trump went off script and used President Biden’s name once, and quickly said he wouldn’t do it again.
""If you took the ten worst presidents in the history of the United States, think of it, the ten worst and added them all up…they will not have done the damage that Biden has done.""
""I’m only going to use the term once. Biden. I'm not going to use the name anymore. Just one time.""

The blast happened approximately one block from a U.S. embassy branch office. (Credit: Trey Yingst)
An explosion that rocked Tel Aviv overnight Thursday has left one person dead and several others wounded.
Military officials say they believe the source of the explosion was a deadly drone attack, and Yemen’s Houthi rebels have already claimed responsibility for a drone strike in the area near the U.S. embassy, the Associated Press reported.
The drone was not intercepted despite it being identified prior to the explosion due to human error. Officials say the systems weren't active at the time of the attack, causing neither the sirens nor the interception to activate.
Large windows are shown shattered after what was believed to be a drone attack on Thursday night. (Trey Yingst)
The drone impacted an apartment in Tel Aviv at approximately 3:12 a.m. after entering the city from the direction of the sea. Officials are unsure if the drone hit the building or exploded mid-air and are still probing the origin of the drone.

FOX_10,WATCH: MSNBC primetime hosts' incendiary coverage of RNC,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-msnbc-primetime-hosts-incendiary-coverage-rnc-raises-eyebrows-conspiracy-talk,2024-07-19 17:01:02.744000,politics,"Highlights of MSNBC coverage of the RNC with left-wing hosts Joy Reid, Alex Wagner and Rachel Maddow.
MSNBC's top primetime anchors and hosts made numerous eyebrow-raising remarks during their coverage of the Republican National Convention, including likening recovery from a mild COVID-19 case to surviving an attempted assassination.
On Monday, the network sidelined ""Morning Joe"" before returning to regular programming, denying any reports that it was because of concerns that the pro-Biden program may say something insensitive on the heels of the Trump shooting in Pennsylvania. But it was the network's rabidly left-wing primetime hosts who made several incendiary comments in their coverage this week. 
MSNBC host Alex Wagner argued that the GOP's pick for vice president, JD Vance, dropped ""Easter eggs of White nationalism"" by saying during his speech on Wednesday that he wanted to be buried in his family's plot in Kentucky.  
""I just think the construction of this notion reveals a lot about someone who fundamentally believes in the supremacy of whiteness and masculinity, and it’s couched in a sort of halcyon, you know, revisitation of his roots, but it is actually really revealing about what he thinks matters and who America is, and that America is a place for people with his shared Western background,"" Wagner said. 
MSNBC's coverage of the RNC and aftermath of the Trump assassination attempt was marked by incendiary rhetoric and controversy. (Left: (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images), Center: (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images), Right: Screenshot/MSNBC, Right: Screenshot/MSNBC)
AMBER ROSE CLAPS BACK AT JOY REID AFTER CRITICIZING CONVENTION SPEECH: ‘STOP BEING A RACE BAITER’
MSNBC's Joy Reid, who has questioned whether Trump was actually shot with a bullet at his rally on Saturday, argued on Wednesday that President Biden getting COVID-19 and recovering was ""the same thing"" as Trump surviving an assassination attempt.
""This current President of the United States is 81 years old and has COVID, should he be fine in a couple of days, doesn't that convey exactly the same thing? That he’s strong enough – older than Trump – to have gotten something that used to really be fatal to people his age. So, if he does fine out of it and comes back and is able to do rallies, isn't that exactly the same?"" Reid said.
She alluded to the questions surrounding Trump's injuries during the discussion as well, saying Trump had gotten a ""photo op"" out of nearly being murdered.
""These two men are both elderly. Donald Trump is an elderly man who, for whatever reason, was given nine seconds to take an iconic photo op during an active shooter situation. Weird situation, we'll figure that out one day,"" Reid said. 
MSNBC'S RACHEL MADDOW, OTHER TOP ANCHORS NOT IN MILWAUKEE FOR RNC, USING LED SCREEN TO APPEAR THEY'RE ON SITE
The far-left host also suggested that Trump couldn't avoid the consequences of his own rhetoric following the assassination attempt. 
""The idea of political violence that we've been nursing really since then, is so dangerous,"" she said. ""It's so dangerous that you cannot avoid the consequences of it, even if you're one of the people promoting it.""
MSNBC host Rachel Maddow took issue with Vance's love for ""Lord of the Rings,"" and seemed to connect the series to the ""far right."" 
""Like his mentor, like Peter Thiel, who had given him all his jobs in the world, Mr. Vance also when he founded his own venture capital firm with help from Peter Thiel, named it after a Lord of the Rings thing. He called it Narya, N-A-R-Y-A, which you can remember because it’s Aryan, but you move the n to the front,"" Maddow said. ""Apparently, that word has something to do with elves and rings from the Lord of the Rings series, I don’t know.""

At another point this week, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace became visibly frustrated over the way Biden had answered a question from NBC's Lester Holt about ""bullseye"" rhetoric directed at Trump.
""There was one way to answer that question, and it was, ‘Lester, should I use the word bullseye or crosshair? No, but the FBI director that Donald Trump selected, his name is Christopher Wray, and he testified under oath before Congress that the greatest threat to this country is no longer foreign terrorism. It's domestic violent extremism,'"" Wallace said, growing angry as she spoke.
""Inside that threat, the biggest bucket by far is right-wing domestic violent extremism, so go talk to them,"" she snapped while pointing her finger.

MSNBC host Michael Steele was also accused of pushing ""conspiracy theories"" this week in questioning whether Trump's ear was hit by a bullet.
""A person lost their life, two have been severely injured, and yet we’ve not received a medical report from the hospital, nor have we received a medical report from the campaign, or from the Trump organization about the extent of the damage to his ear,"" Steele said.
The series of controversial remarks comes on the heels of a bizarre story that engulfed the network on Monday.
The hosts of ""Morning Joe"" were told on Sunday, according to host Joe Scarborough, that their show would be off the air Monday since there would be a single news feed on all NBC platforms, including MSNBC, following the assassination attempt against Trump. However, their show wound up being the only one that was supplanted and MSNBC returned to regular programming afterward, leaving the show's hosts and production team upset.
A network spokesperson denied a CNN report that the show was held off the air on Monday for fear of the anti-Trump show making any controversial remarks. It returned to the air on Tuesday, where Scarborough publicly criticized the network for its decision-making.

FOX_11,Biden is clearly in poor health. We deserve an honest and transparent report,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-clearly-poor-health-deserve-honest-transparent-report,2024-07-19 17:01:02.744000,politics,"ABC News hosts George Stephanopoulos and Jon Karl, as well as NBC's Kristen Welker, all offered some blunt assessments of President Biden's standing among prominent Democrats as he faces more calls to bow out.
Presidential fitness is a serious matter, and we in the media are not doing the American public any favors by speculating about what is going on with President Joe Biden, just as the White House is not doing us any favors by obfuscating the truth. 
We do know that he currently has COVID-19, with mild upper respiratory symptoms so far and his chances of a severe course markedly reduced since he is taking Paxlovid. On the other hand, recurrent COVID does increase your risk of post-COVID problems, including worsening cognition. 
Speaking of cognition, I don’t believe that Biden is suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, despite the media swirl of accusations and the fact that Dr. Kevin Cannard, a movement disorders specialist from Walter Reed Medical Center, has visited the White House at least eight times over the past year.  
ABC, NBC MORNING SHOWS GIVE BLUNT ASSESSMENT OF BIDEN'S FUTURE: 'CODE RED'
First of all, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the White House physician, has denied the president has Parkinson's Disease in two yearly physical summary official letters as well as a recent update. There is no reason to believe a licensed physician would lie on an official medical document.  
President Biden’s disastrous debate performance ""changed people’s calculations about how candid they would be"" about his cognitive issues, according to Olivia Nuzzi. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) | (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) | Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Plus, many neurologists I have spoken to who have observed the president on numerous videos and prolonged speeches have seen no sign of characteristic Parkinsonian features including shuffling gait, cogwheel rigidity of the upper extremities, tremors, etc. Granted, videos are no replacement for an in-person examination, even in the era of telemedicine.
So, what is the president suffering from? There are many possibilities. The public is right to be alarmed when it sees these lapses, with the inability to follow a line of thought, to speak clearly, accompanied by periods of disorientation and confusion.  
And the president did undergo a now outdated surgical repair of two brain aneurysms in 1988, and he did sustain a brain bleed at the time which can be associated with long-term cognitive impairment. But I think another explanation for his apparent neurological issues could be his longtime atrial fibrillation for which he takes blood thinners.  
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Multiple studies have now shown that patients with atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular heart rhythm) are at markedly increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Associated risks include inadequate brain perfusion, small silent strokes, tiny hemorrhages and ""watershed"" areas of the outside of the brain (known as white matter) which studies show can get too little oxygen in cases of permanent atrial fibrillation. Problems with insufficient blood flow to the white matter of the brain have been shown to cause cognitive problems.  
Periods of rigidity and a stiffened gait, as the president has shown, can also be due to vascular dementia or too much fluid on the brain (Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus). Is this what the president is suffering from? We simply don't know.   
Every neurologist I know would immediately perform an MRI of the brain (with diffusion) or a CT scan if an MRI is not doable because of aneurysm clips – on someone with Biden’s obvious symptoms and medical history to look for small cumulative areas of injury. An MRI might help a neurologist to make a definitive diagnosis.  
A 10–15-minute cognitive test such as the Montreal test, which examines recall, recognition, and judgment, would be helpful if the president scored low. But we also must keep in mind that cognitive problems tend to wax and wane and full-scale neuropsychological testing by an independent expert would likely reveal more.  
So, what is the president suffering from? There are many possibilities. The public is right to be alarmed when it sees these lapses, with the inability to follow a line of thought, to speak clearly, accompanied by periods of disorientation and confusion.

Whenever there is a sudden health concern on the part of a prominent leader, the media fills with speculation. Terms like Parkinson’s Disease and cognitive testing are being thrown around by journalists and pundits who have never used them before and really have no idea what they mean. This isn’t fair to the White House, to the president, and it isn’t fair to the public.  
What we need instead is an honest and transparent and up-to-date report from the White House physician not just in terms of the president's current COVID, but also the impact of his underlying health problems. Whether or not President Biden ends up dropping out of the race for health reasons or not, in the meantime, some transparency would be very refreshing.

FOX_12,Can't make this up: Alec Baldwin saved by shocking Hollywood ending to ‘Rust’ shooting trial,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cant-make-up-alec-baldwin-saved-shocking-hollywood-ending-rust-shooting-trial,2024-07-19 17:01:02.744000,opinion,"Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt has the latest on the stunning end to the actor's involuntary manslaughter trial in the 'Rust' set shooting case.
In a surprising turn of events, charges against actor Alec Baldwin were dismissed with prejudice on Friday, July 12, 2024, with the trial ending before it even really began. Per the judge’s ruling, Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter case cannot be filed again, a decision which brought the actor to tears as he sat in the courtroom. 
Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter for negligent use of a firearm while on set for his upcoming movie, ""Rust."" Negligence is a failure to exercise appropriate care expected to be exercised in similar circumstances or, in the alternative, involuntary manslaughter (without due caution or circumspection), both fourth-degree felonies. 
At the time of the incident, Baldwin was handed the prop gun that day and told it was ""cold,"" meaning there was no live ammunition inside. However, Baldwin contends the trigger was never pulled. Instead, stating the gun discharged a single time when it was removed from the holster on set.  
CONVICTED 'RUST' ARMORER ASKS FOR NEW TRIAL AFTER ALEC BALDWIN'S INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CASE DISMISSED
The chamber of the revolver contained an actual lead bullet that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

The report from the forensics expert, Lucien C. Haag, did not directly address whether the gun had been modified. Though it concluded the old-fashioned Pietta revolver would have needed about two pounds of pressure on the trigger to discharge a round.  
In his report, Haag noted parts of the revolver were broken at the time he received it and that, to test it, he had to replace those parts with new ones. Baldwin’s lawyers had previously raised questions about how such a damaged gun could be properly examined and have pointed to the gun’s fracturing during testing to suggest the gun was defective when Baldwin was using it. 
Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed had already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, a felony, in Hutchins’ death, and sentenced to 18 months in prison earlier this year, the maximum penalty for this charge. A question that would’ve been posed at Baldwin’s trial would be if two parties could be found guilty of the same crime. 
At the time of her sentencing, the judge in the case referred to Gutierrez-Reed’s ""lack of remorse"" throughout the trial. The prosecutor, Kari T. Morrissey, said she reviewed Gutierrez-Reed’s phone calls from jail to determine what sentence to recommend to the judge. Morrissey said the calls reflected that Gutierrez-Reed did not take responsibility for Hutchins’ death and chose to ""place blame on the witnesses that testified against her.""  
However, for Baldwin, all conjecture regarding his action or inaction is a moot point, as this case has come to a close.  
New Mexico Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case based on prosecutorial and police misconduct for withholding evidence from the defense, citing case law regarding Brady violations. General examples of Brady violations, including false testimony, lack of credibility of someone assigned to the case, and/or withholding physical evidence that suggests a defendant is not guilty of a crime. 
The Judge stated, ""The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings. If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith to show signs of scorching."" 
The evidence referenced was ammunition revealed during testimony on Thursday, July 11, 2024. It was brought into the sheriff’s office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins’ killing. At the time, prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin’s lawyers alleged they ""buried"" it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.

Consequently, Gutirrez-Reed is appealing her own conviction, and her attorney noted he would file a motion to dismiss based on the decision in Baldwin’s case. And, in a final, surprising twist, special prosecutor, Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, who delivered the state’s opening statement, resigned from the case on Friday prior to the judge’s dismissal of the charges. 
In what was a roller coaster of a case has finally come to its conclusion.

The shooting incident occurred on October 21, 2021. More than a year later, Baldwin was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter and firearm enhancement charges in January 2023. 
The second charge was dropped and then, both charges were dismissed altogether in April 2023 as prosecutors at the time cited ""new facts in the case."" However, in January 2024, a grand jury indicted Baldwin on a new involuntary manslaughter charge which led to the July 2024 trial.  
The Judge stated, ""The late discovery of this evidence during trial has impeded the effective use of evidence in such a way that it has impacted the fundamental fairness of the proceedings. If this conduct does not rise to the level of bad faith, it certainly comes so near to bad faith to show signs of scorching."" 
Due to the back-and-forth nature of the case from the beginning, the question is: Did prosecutors have a strong case against Baldwin to begin with, and with whom did the responsibility of the incident lie?

Now that Judge Marlowe Sommer has put an end to this case once and for all, it’ll be interesting to see if there will be changes to Gutirrez-Reed’s sentencing, and if she will be released from prison. 
Baldwin has faced his fair share of legal troubles in the past, but for now, he has a clean slate.

Former Obama adviser Van Jones argued Thursday that the energy at this week's Republican National Convention was comparable to what he saw when former President Obama was first nominated in 2008.
Jones, now a CNN senior political commentator, talked about the palpable ""spirit"" and enthusiasm he could feel among the people at the RNC.
After CNN contributor Scott Jennings spoke with excitement about wrestler Hulk Hogan, UFC head Dana White and former President Trump's upcoming speeches at the RNC, Jones said, ""This spirit that this guy [Jennings] has, you guys think it’s because he’s drunk, he’s not, this whole thing is like this."" 
""The last time I was at a convention that felt like this was Obama 2008. There's something happening,"" he said.

One of his fellow panelists joked that Jones ""wrote a headline"" with that statement. 
Earlier in the evening, Jones commented on the former president enduring a litany of challenges before standing ready to receive the Republican nomination.
""Dreams become nightmares and nightmares become dreams. You're watching a nightmare become a dream for Donald Trump,"" Jones said. ""He has had a nightmarish summer with, you know, convictions and indictments and all kinds of stuff, almost got shot. It's becoming a dream for him.""
But for President Joe Biden, he argued, the dream has become a nightmare.
""Biden's the opposite. The dream that he had for himself as a young man to stand up and to rescue this country and to move it in a positive direction he actually delivered, he actually delivered on that. He did beat all those odds. He has done extraordinary things. He is extraordinary man,"" he said. ""But by holding on too long it’s becoming a nightmare. And the donors who have written huge checks for him, I mean the biggest checks are the ones who are stepping back."" 
He followed by noting that Biden's ""peers,"" like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, ""are now turning on him, and now tonight he's sick and he's watching all this happen. It may take him a moment, but I believe he will get where he needs to go. This is a terrible, terrible moment for Joe Biden.""

LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION
Jones has criticized Democrats and credited strong moves by Republicans multiple times in recent weeks, particularly Wednesday after Biden announced he had COVID-19 a few days after Trump narrowly avoided an attempted assassination.
""If you pull back and look at this thing: strength versus weakness. A bullet couldn‘t stop Trump. A virus just stopped Biden,"" Jones said after the COVID news broke.
He also warned that TV personality and model Amber Rose’s RNC address Monday in support of Trump was the ""most dangerous speech"" for the Democratic Party.
Jones remarked at the time, ""That is a young woman of color. She’s describing the experience a lot of people have, feeling that maybe if you’re around too many liberals you might get criticized too much, or you might not be able to speak your mind. And she spoke to it really well.""

FOX_15,CNN's Jake Tapper calls out MSNBC for skipping RNC: 'We're here live as opposed to some other networks',https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-jake-tapper-calls-out-msnbc-skipping-rnc-were-here-live-opposed-some-other-networks,2024-07-19 19:30:02.845840,politics,"CNN host Jake Tapper called out MSNBC for skipping the RNC to cover it from New York City with an LED screen.
CNN anchor Jake Tapper took aim at MSNBC with a pointed on-air remark Thursday after it was revealed that the liberal network was using an LED screen to cover the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee from their studio in New York City.
""We are here live, as opposed to some other networks that just have a big LED, who shall remain nameless,"" Tapper said during an interview with Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who has been leading the network's coverage of the GOP convention this week, has repeatedly appeared on air with the backdrop of the convention behind her, leading casual viewers to assume she was on the ground in Milwaukee. But Maddow and many of her colleagues, including Nicolle Wallace, Jen Psaki, Joy Reid and other MSNBC anchors have not been inside the convention hall or even in the same city, according to the Times report.
LIVE UPDATES: REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION

""Instead, they were broadcasting from a studio in Midtown Manhattan, as a live feed of the convention floor was projected onto an LED screen behind them,"" the Times report reads.
""The arrangement — which several veteran television news producers described as unorthodox — has created something of a trompe l’oeil effect. A casual glance at the screen would suggest that MSNBC’s top anchors were covering the convention in person,"" the article continues, using a French phrase referring to highly realistic-looking but visually deceptive artwork.
MSNBC did previously announce last week that Maddow and other top political anchors would not travel to Milwaukee for the convention. Instead, the network sent Stephanie Ruhle, who hosts ""The 11th Hour,"" and daytime host Katy Tur, per the Times.

An MSNBC spokesman told the Times that at ""the top of every broadcast, hosts identify themselves as being in New York or at MSNBC headquarters."" But critics say the live video feed of a bustling convention behind them sends a different impression to viewers tuning in throughout the night.
Tapper made the comment moments before former President Trump accepted the 2024 Republican nomination.

As we still digest how in the world a random 20-year-old, armed with a high-powered rifle, could have walked up within 150 yards of a presidential campaign rally, climbed onto a rooftop, in full view of Secret Service snipers, set up and fired multiple rounds, nearly assassinating a former U.S. president. And while the shooter, ostensibly, was acting completely alone, no one among the dozens of law enforcement and security personnel interdicted him. 
You know who else has been watching closely this nearly catastrophic event, as well as everything else that is happening in our country? China and Russia, both of whom consider the United States as their top adversary that must be defeated – if not on the battlefield then from within.
Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and their respective spy agencies have been evaluating the recent events taking place in America – the Trump-Biden debate, the Washington NATO summit, and President Biden’s fitness for another term.
WITHOUT PUTIN WHAT DID ZELENSKYY'S SWISS PEACE SUMMIT ACHIEVE?

They have concluded that despite the rhetoric and chest-beating coming out of Washington, America’s security is compromised. It would be surprising if the two dictators refrained from exploiting this. Here’s why. 
First, between now and Jan. 20, the U.S. will continue to be led by a president who is seen as increasingly unable to fully discharge his duties as commander in chief, a critical vulnerability, especially in a time of crisis or even a war. The Trump-Biden presidential debate and the ""Big Boy"" presser, during which Biden called Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy ""President Putin"" and Kamala Harris ""Vice President Trump,"" confirmed what Putin and Xi, already knew – Biden is severely impaired, cognitively and physically. 
While many Americans may have been unaware of this fact, due to concerted efforts by Biden’s handlers and some in the media to conceal it, it was not a surprise to the Russians and Chinese whose intelligence services routinely develop profiles of every U.S. president. The new takeaway for Putin and Xi is that, bombarded with calls for Biden to withdraw from the race, his administration is now fighting for its survival and clearly isn’t focused on U.S. security. It won’t take much to further unbalance an already distracted U.S. president and his team.
Second, by committing itself more deeply to Ukraine’s security, the United States is further entangling itself into a probable war with Russia, which would be catastrophic. The Pentagon has no viable military strategy to win such a war – just like to this day, it has none in Ukraine. Such a war will likely cross the nuclear threshold, as assessed by U.S. intelligence.

During the Washington summit, the 32-member NATO alliance formally declared Ukraine, which has served as part of Russia’s strategic security perimeter since the ninth century, on an ""irreversible"" path to membership. Russia and the United States have declared each other, formally, as top threats to their respective security.
Putin, who for years has stated that a NATO membership for Ukraine is a ""red line,"" will likely risk going to war with the United States over Ukraine, as revealed by multiple war games conducted by the U.S. intelligence community. On his orders, a war-fighting strategy, which includes nuclear arms, space weapons and cyber warfare, was developed. The Kremlin believes this strategy can achieve victory on Russia’s terms.
Third, neither the United States, nor NATO has the industrial capacity to prosecute a war with Russia, let alone a two-front war, simultaneously with Russia and China. 
Putin has prepared for a protracted years-long war in Ukraine, having transitioned the Russian military and economy onto a wartime footing seven years prior to the invasion. Putin has also sanction-proofed Russia’s economy, which – contrary to Washington’s forecasts – has been growing, propelled by the weapons manufacturing sector. Having a comfortable financial cushion of $580 billion in foreign currency and gold reserves, Russia has increased its defense budget by 70% in 2024 compared to 2023. 
Russia’s weapons production capacity has increased in one year as follows: sevenfold for battle tanks, sixfold for ammunition, quadrupled for armored platforms, and doubled for artillery and rocket systems. Drone production increased by 80% in 2023.

In contrast, the U.S. and European allies, which officially are not at war, lack production and contractual capacity to match Putin’s war machine. Last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg admitted during an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that the West’s production capacity has been delinquent and that Ukraine’s demands for military hardware in order to stay in the fight against Russia are not fully met.
Unlike Russia, where Putin personally can order factories to transition from civilian to military production, the U.S. and European defense industries are subject to bureaucratic requirements, such as funding approvals and contracting capacity. These companies cannot start building weapons until a contract is negotiated, approved and funded. 
Besides, a lot of U.S. high-tech weaponry has proven ineffective on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Russians, who have studied U.S. employment of technology in military operations for the past two decades, have been developing countermeasures for what the Pentagon calls ""network centric warfare."" Russia’s superior electronic warfare capabilities have disrupted or degraded many U.S. combat systems reliant on GPS. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, citing Ukrainian commanders, certain U.S. munitions are no longer in use on the battlefield. For example, the M982 Excalibur, developed by RTX and BAE Systems, and the ground-launched small diameter bomb, manufactured by Boeing and Sweden’s Saab.

In April, a top leader in the U.S. Space Force, a new branch of service stood up by President Trump, noted the ""unprecedented level of electronic warfare (EW)"" used by Russia, to jam U.S. GPS, on which the U.S. military relies for basic functions, including precision targeting and command and control. Col. Nicole Petrucci, the commander of the USSF’s combat-ready forces as head of Space Delta 3, during an AFA Warfighters in Action event, expressed concern that U.S. forces would struggle operating in such an environment. She noted the need for ""the right simulators"" and ""good enough"" instructors who understand the ""high-end threat environment,"" to train U.S. military personnel to fight in wars with top U.S. opponents such as Russia and China.
Other U.S. officials have admitted that the high level of electronic warfare in Ukraine could dwarf what the U.S. could face in a conflict with China, which plans to cripple U.S. satellites in wartime, including kinetically.

In his Big Boy press conference, Biden claimed that ""NATO stands stronger than it has ever been."" He reminded us that America’s obligation of Article 5 – which commits the United States to defending any NATO member if attacked – is ""sacred."" He added that he ""will not walk away from Ukraine,"" which has yet to become a NATO member.
What Putin and Xi have concluded, however, is that despite billions of dollars spent annually on intelligence, high-tech weaponry and foreign wars, Washington has not closed some glaring gaps in America’s security. The world’s most brutal dictators are delighted to know that a former and possibly future U.S. president is still alive only thanks to an act of God, and not because he is well-protected.

A retired U.S. Secret Service agent questioned why former President Trump was cleared to take the stage at Saturday's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, despite a ""person of interest"" being identified beforehand.
""Why the rush? Why push him on stage? Why not delay?"" questioned Mike Matranga on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday.
""It would have taken nothing to take a tactical pause, assess the situation, locate him, and potentially prevent what we haven't seen in 43 years.""
LIVE UPDATES: SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR REFUSES TO STEP DOWN AS FBI INVESTIGATES TRUMP RALLY SHOOTER
Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was perceived by the Secret Service as a ""person of interest"" after law enforcement saw him acting suspiciously and determined he had a golf range finder, according to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.   
Crooks was only identified as a threat when he ""retrieved the weapon"" and climbed onto the roof of a building just prior to the shooting, according to Guglielmi, who added that a threat requires, ""a different protocol and a different course of action than a person of interest."" 
Soon after that, Butler Township police officers confronted Crooks on the roof, and he pointed his weapon at one of them, who then dropped off the roof. Crooks then fired on Trump and was taken out by a Secret Service counter sniper. 
Matranga called the situation a ""catastrophic failure.""
""Failing to even address the American people or to point the finger solely at the local law enforcement is just not right,"" he said. ""This is a catastrophic failure of communications. We've known this for decades, that we rely too heavily on our local counterparts to do the jobs that we are designed to do, and so this is a catastrophic failure.""
""The former president deserves better,"" he continued. ""The individuals who were harmed and the individual who succumbed to his injuries deserve better.""

In the wake of the incident, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is facing pressure to resign, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., telling FOX Business on Thursday that he is ready to call on President Biden to fire her.
In an interview with ABC News Tuesday, Cheatle said the Secret Service was aware of the security vulnerabilities presented by the building Crooks took a sniper's position on to aim at Trump. However, a decision was made not to place any personnel on the roof.  
Cheatle made the remark hours after Fox News Digital reported that a local law enforcement officer spotted a suspicious man carrying a range-finder just 30 minutes before Saturday’s attempted assassination.
""That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof. And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside,"" she said.

CNN commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones quipped Democrats were the ones who ""dodged a bullet"" after former President Trump concluded his lengthy nomination acceptance speech Thursday night.
Trump formally accepted the GOP nomination after surviving an assassination attempt on his life on Saturday at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. His RNC speech, which lasted approximately 92 minutes, covered the chaos on Saturday, his family and President Biden, but critics like Jones said it was rambling and unfocused.
""Trump dodged a bullet on Saturday and Democrats dodged a bullet tonight,"" Jones said after Trump's address, in remarks that could have been construed as insensitive given Trump was shot less than a week ago.

""That was a mess,"" Jones said. ""That was just a big mess,"" adding Trump ""just couldn't help himself.""
The commentator said that Democrats would have stopped President Biden if he had given a speech ""that incoherent, that rambling"" and ""that undisciplined."" 
""He had the whole world in his hands,"" Jones said of Trump's political upsurge after the assassination attempt. ""If he had just stayed with that unity message, he might have caused some problems. He just could not help himself."" 
Jones argued that Trump's speech had returned the campaign from a unique political situation following his survival to a ""normal campaign dynamic."" 
""Trump took what was the most energetic convention, and he was boring,"" Jones said. ""He took the most disciplined convention, and he was undisciplined.""

""10 minutes of unity talk off the teleprompter followed by rabid attacks on Nancy Pelosi, on Joe Biden and talking about Hannibal Lecter?"" Jones said. ""That is not a new Trump.""
CNN commentator David Axelrod said after the speech that Trump's remarks marked the first positive development for Democrats in weeks, given their disarray and mounting calls to boot Biden off the 2024 ticket.
Jones said earlier Thursday that the energy at this week's Republican National Convention was comparable to what he saw when former President Obama was first nominated in 2008.

The Washington Post came under fire on Friday after it scolded the parents of an American hostage in Gaza for not publicly criticizing Israel's ""assault on Gaza"" and the ""looming famine"" there.
""Omer Neutra has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. When his parents speak publicly, they don't talk about Israel's assault on Gaza that has killed over 38,000 Palestinians, according to local officials. Experts have warned of looming famine,"" the Post wrote on X. 
The post linked to an interview the paper conducted with Omer's parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, ahead of their speech on day three of the Republican National Convention.
Omer, 22, grew up in Long Island, New York, and was a dual American-Israeli citizen serving in the Israel Defense Forces. He is believed to have been abducted by Hamas on October 7 during its horrific terrorist attack.
The Post's social media post attracted criticism before the paper took it down hours later.
The paper published another X post explaining that it deleted the initial one because it had ""mischaracterized the efforts of Neutra’s parents.""

A new version of the original post now reads, ""Omer Neutra, an American hostage in the Israel-Hamas war, has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. His parents have mounted a relentless effort to get him released, speaking to anyone who might be able to support their cause.""
While the social media post was taken down, a similar paragraph remains in the body of the full story posted on the Post's website.
""When the Neutras speak publicly, they don’t talk about the ferocity of Israel’s counterattack, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and left nearly 90,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Swaths of the territory have been pulverized and international experts have warned of looming famine,"" the article reads.
Immediately after this graph, the Post quotes the Neutras expressing empathy for Gazans.

""What’s happening in Gaza is ‘horrible,’ Orna said, but Hamas could end it by releasing the hostages. Ronen echoed that sentiment: Hamas is ‘not only holding hostage our son, they’re also holding hostage the people of Gaza,’"" the story continues.
The Post did not return a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
The paper has come under fire from Jewish groups for its reporting on the war in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack last October.
An antisemitism nonprofit accused the paper of ""aligning"" itself with pro-terrorist groups since the October 7 attacks after publishing a sympathetic story in April about individuals who'd lost their jobs for defending Hamas.

FOX_21,New poll reveals what Democrats think of Harris as president,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-what-democrats-think-harris-president,2024-07-19 23:18:02.936129,politics,"Morale is plummeting among Biden staff and Democratic officials still loyal to President Biden’s re-election campaign, CNN reported on Friday, with the fight to get him to withdraw from the race or stay turning off many people involved.
With President Biden's future uncertain, a majority of Democrats say the country would be in good hands if his vice president took over the White House. 
A new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Vice President Kamala Harris would do a good job as president herself. About 2 in 10 Democrats don’t believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don’t know enough to say.
The survey comes as an increasing number of Democratic officials are publicly urging Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election after his disastrous debate performance on June 27. Democratic officials are worried that voters don't believe the 81-year-old president is capable of performing his duties, and many have suggested that Harris or another candidate would fare better against the Republican nominee, former President Trump. 
Recent polls show Democratic voters have soured on Biden as well. A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of Massachusetts residents found that 64% of likely Democratic or Democratic-leaning voters want someone other than Biden to face off against Trump. The AP-NORC national survey likewise found that 65% of Democrats say Biden should drop out of the race.

While Harris is the focus of several insider discussions for a plan B ticket, the vice president has maintained strong public support for Biden and defended him from slings and arrows thrown by panicked party officials speaking anonymously to the press.
But if Harris, 59, were to replace Biden atop the ticket, Democratic voters would mostly be happy with the younger candidate — a woman of color who could champion the party's message on abortion rights and a former state attorney general who could prosecute the case against Trump, a convicted felon in New York.

Harris could also motivate key Democratic constituencies to show up on Election Day, including women and Black adults, who were more likely than Americans overall to say Harris would do well as president. 
Americans outside the Democratic Party were more skeptical of how Harris would perform in the Oval Office. Only about 3 in 10 Americans say Harris would be a good president. Nearly half said Harris would not do a good job, and 2 in 10 say they don't know enough to have an opinion.

Harris’ favorability rating is similar to Biden’s, but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is somewhat lower. The poll showed that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Harris, while about half have an unfavorable opinion. There are more Americans with a negative view of Biden: approximately 6 in 10. About 1 in 10 Americans say they don’t know enough to have an opinion of Harris, whereas nearly everyone has an opinion on Biden.
About three-quarters of Democrats have a positive view of Harris, which is in line with how Democrats view Biden. Seven in 10 have a favorable view of him.

Harris is also better-known among Democrats than other potential candidates, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. About one-third of Democrats say Newsom would make a good president, and half don’t know enough to say. About one-quarter of Democrats say Whitmer would do well, and about two-thirds don’t know enough to say.
The AP poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

Five more House Democrats joined the growing number of congressional lawmakers who have called on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 election on Friday. 
In a joint statement, Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Marc Veasey, D-Texas, Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois and Marc Pocan, D-Wisc., urged Biden to ""pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders."" 
The fifth House Democrat, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, separately urged Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune. 
""It’s time for Joe Biden to pass the torch,"" Casten wrote.
""[P]olitics, like life, isn’t fair. And as long as this election is instead litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and ‘senior moments,’ I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation.""

Morale is plummeting among staff and Democratic officials still loyal to President Biden’s re-election campaign, CNN reported on Friday, with the fight over getting him to withdraw from the race or stay turning off many people involved.
The outlet spoke to dozens of Democratic officials, White House and Biden campaign aides, as well as other Biden allies, some of whom have characterized the feeling surrounding Biden’s re-election bid as a ""doom loop."" The intra-party war over whether Biden will be replaced as presidential nominee or stay appears to have drained the resolve of those backing the president.
""There’s a growing sense that it’s game over,"" one Biden aide told the outlet. 
As CNN noted, these voices find that Biden’s post-debate situation has become ""dark and confused."" Top Democratic leaders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and former President Obama are reportedly pushing to get a new party nominee or souring on Biden's chances, while Biden and his inner circle still cling to his re-election bid.

In a response to Trump’s RNC speech Thursday night, Biden declared, ""I am more determined than ever to defeat Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda in November.""
Despite such declarations, some of Biden’s staff anonymously told CNN they don’t see much hope. 
""Even among aides in the White House and Wilmington who for long after the debate were ready to stick with him, the weight has started to feel too much,"" the outlet reported.
It noted that some said they’re planning to quit, while others have already ""quiet quit"" and are just ""going through the motions"" until Biden is eventually replaced.
One person told CNN, ""I don’t think you can find a person who is off the record saying he should stay in.""
The outlet stated that faith in the Biden inner circle has been ""obliterated,"" and that other top aides have taken to ""emailing and texting to check in about how far down into despair they are day by day"" rather than focus on campaign operations.

Still, some of Biden’s top advisors insist the campaign is running well. Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz told the outlet, ""Here in HQ, we’re working really hard because on winning campaigns, you work really hard. There’s an immense sense of pride across our office, because we know how important and critical that work we are doing here is for the fate of our democracy.""
Despite some Biden operatives’ continued optimism, Democratic lawmakers have said they’re seeing the writing on the wall with the Biden campaign.
A recent Axios piece quoted some of these individuals, with Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., telling the outlet, ""A change at the top of the ticket has taken on an aura of inevitability.""
Even Biden loyalists in Congress admitted that momentum is against Biden. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., told Axios, ""I don't believe President Biden should step aside, but it appears that opinion is being overruled.""
Another pro-Biden lawmaker, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., said, ""I am concerned that the tide is turning against Biden.""

When asked about CNN's report, a Biden campaign spokesperson pointed Fox News Digital to a quote from Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon on Friday.
""The president's in this race,"" she said on MSNBC. ""You've heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why, because Donald Trump is not going to offer anything new to the American people. He's the same person he was in 2020. He's the same person he was at the debate stage. He's the same person he is—that is about himself and not about the American people, and Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.""

FOX_24,Democrat godfathers make Biden offer they hope he can't refuse,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrat-godfathers-make-biden-offer-hope-he-cant-refuse,2024-07-20 00:09:02.914952,politics,"WSJ editorial page assistant editor James Freeman joined 'America's Newsroom' to react to the report as the president faces growing calls to step aside. 
Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic Party commission seem prepared to make Joe Biden an offer he can’t refuse: One way or another, he’s dropping out of this race, they say, either with his consent or with his legacy destroyed.
Just when Biden thought his candidacy was safe, after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump quieted talk of a swap at the top of the ticket, they pulled him back in, and now the pundits tell us that his campaign won’t survive the weekend. We’ll see.
For the bosses of the Democrat family, ending Biden’s political career is a three-step process. First they ask him to leave, then they tell him to leave, and finally they threaten to destroy him if he won't wise up. We are almost at step three.
SOURCES CLOSE TO BIDEN ‘FURIOUS’ ABOUT GROWING CALLS TO GET HIM TO EXIT RACE
The advantages of step one are very clear. Had Biden selflessly and magnanimously put his own interests aside for the betterment of the party, if not the country, by dropping out, he might have seen the kind of double-digit approval bounce Lyndon Baines Johnson got in 1968. That boost would accrue to the benefit of the new candidate, likely Kamala Harris.

Likewise, he would secure his legacy as the caretaker president who saved the nation from the evils of the Trump Family and bestowed power upon the new, young generation. 
That ship has sailed now, and we are squarely on step two. But Biden has already rejected team Obama when they told him, ""that’s a nice legacy you got there. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.""
The threats from the editorial boards of The New York Times and Chicago Tribune, the consiglieres of the Democratic Party, have been ignored by an obstinate sitting president who for some reason, thinks he's in charge.
LIBERAL NEWSPAPERS, BIDEN MEDIA ALLIES PRESSURE PRESIDENT TO DROP OUT OF RACE
Now Biden seems poised to wake up with a bloody equine head in his bed, and the Democrats have no shortage of horses to choose from. 
Perhaps the tape of his interview with special counsel Robert Hur will be released. If the audio wasn’t humiliating to Biden, we would have it already, so not for nothing, it can’t be good. Attorney General Merrick Garland could have a sudden change of heart. These things happen.
Then there is his prodigal son, Hunter, who hopes to beat the rap and go legit with his art career. If Joe declines to run, there is no reason he can’t pardon the family Fredo, especially after the election, win or lose.

Finally, there is the 25th amendment, the ultimate play, in which Democrats would remove Biden from office, his legacy in tatters. He would be the only president ever kicked out of office for losing his marbles.
Basically, the Democrats have politely asked Joe, Jill and Hunter to leave the establishment. Soon the door will lock, and they will hear the words, ""now youse can’t leave,"" before the punches start flying.
So the Democrats don’t lack the cards to get Joe off the ticket, but at the same time, the big guy is not without his own moves. If he chooses not to go gently into the night, if he refuses to endorse Kamala Harris, then the Dems have a whole new contested convention headache.
Biden could also flip and turn state’s evidence, spilling tea on the Democrat’s family secrets, essentially burning down the party trying to throw him under the bus.

No, this is still up to Joe, even if he is mumbling and drooling as he stumbles around in his bathrobe. He is still the boss for now, and if an attempt to topple him fails, the Bidens will be taking care of all the family business.
And if you think that isn’t possible, I’d ask you, now who’s being naive?

The next few days will prove decisive, as Biden's enemies reveal themselves. Can Joe Biden still hang on? Even win? Yeah, he can, and hell hath no fury like a boss betrayed.
Will Joe leave the presidency and take the cannolis? We will know soon, and either way, it could change everything in the race just three months from the finish line.

President Biden's catastrophic performance at the recent presidential debate has sparked panic among the Democratic Party’s hierarchy, with key players said to be mulling how to get him to abandon his re-election bid.
The situation has plunged the party into crisis and threatens to drive a wedge between Biden loyalists and elected officials in swing districts ahead of next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
Biden's top campaign aides have been working damage control with major donors, while the White House – and Biden himself – remain adamant he is the right man to lead the party against former President Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., expressed concerns about Biden's health. 
Twenty-three Democratic governors from across the nation descended on the White House last Wednesday evening to meet with the embattled president, but after the gathering, only Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore spoke to reporters to express their support. 
Moore described the meeting with Biden as ""honest"" and ""candid"" and said the governors were ""going to have his back.""
Hochul said Biden was ""in it to win it"" and that the trio had pledged their support to him ""because the stakes could not be higher,"" invoking on the eve of Independence Day the fight against tyranny.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many commentators have proposed as a possible Biden replacement, also took part in the White House meeting and backed the 81-year-old. 
""I heard three words from the President tonight – he’s all in. And so am I,"" Newsom posted on X on July 3. Newsom also publicly backed Biden immediately after the debate.

Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker has also publicly backed Biden, as has Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green. 
Elsewhere, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a longtime Biden ally, has also expressed his support, as well as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

Now it’s time for us to have his."" 
Rep. Al Green of Texas has said ""I think that we need to move forward with Biden.""

""We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,"" they said.
""At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign.

There are now 28 Congressional Democrats who have called on Biden to step aside. That number represents more than 10% of elected Democrats in Congress. 
Behind the scenes, more and more Democratic party officials, top donors and key Biden allies are reportedly urging the president to reconsider his decision to stay in the race. Should Biden drop out ahead of the Democratic National Committee convention in August, Vice President Kamala Harris is acknowledged to be in the best position to receive the party's nomination — although some Democrats fear she would also lose to Trump and prefer that a candidate unaffiliated with the current administration be nominated in an open convention.
Biden has made no public indication that he intends to step aside, and his campaign has forcefully denied all suggestions to the contrary.

The Washington Post came under fire after it scolded the parents of an American hostage in Gaza for not publicly criticizing Israel's ""assault"" there and admitted Friday that its social media post was ""unacceptable.""
""Omer Neutra has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. When his parents speak publicly, they don't talk about Israel's assault on Gaza that has killed over 38,000 Palestinians, according to local officials. Experts have warned of looming famine,"" the Post wrote on X. 
The post linked to an interview the paper conducted with Omer's parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, ahead of their speech on day three of the Republican National Convention.
The Post's social media post attracted fierce criticism before the paper took it down hours later.
In another X post published Friday morning, the paper explained that it deleted the initial post because it had ""mischaracterized the efforts of Neutra’s parents."" The paper followed up hours later with a more thorough explanation.
""A previous post referencing the below story was unacceptable and did not meet our editorial standards, and The Post has deleted it. The reporter of the story was not involved in crafting the tweet. We have taken the appropriate action regarding this incident,"" The Post wrote on X.
Omer, 22, grew up in Long Island, New York, and was a dual American-Israeli citizen serving in the Israel Defense Forces. He is believed to have been abducted by Hamas on October 7 during its horrific terrorist attack.

A new version of the original post now reads, ""Omer Neutra, an American hostage in the Israel-Hamas war, has been missing since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. His parents have mounted a relentless effort to get him released, speaking to anyone who might be able to support their cause.""
While the social media post was taken down, a similar paragraph remains in the body of the full story posted on the Post's website.
""When the Neutras speak publicly, they don’t talk about the ferocity of Israel’s counterattack, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and left nearly 90,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Swaths of the territory have been pulverized and international experts have warned of looming famine,"" the article reads.
Immediately after this graph, the Post quotes the Neutras expressing empathy for Gazans.

""What’s happening in Gaza is ‘horrible,’ Orna said, but Hamas could end it by releasing the hostages. Ronen echoed that sentiment: Hamas is ‘not only holding hostage our son, they’re also holding hostage the people of Gaza,’"" the story continues.
The Post referred Fox News Digital to its statements on X when reached for comment.
The paper has come under fire from Jewish groups for its reporting on the war in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack last October.
An antisemitism nonprofit accused the paper of ""aligning"" itself with pro-terrorist groups since the October 7 attacks after publishing a sympathetic story in April about individuals who'd lost their jobs for defending Hamas.

Multiple political commentators and reporters compared former President Trump's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to the speaking style of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
Castro, who died in 2016, gave famously long speeches, including remarks in 1960 that went for 4 hours and 29 minutes at the United Nations. Trump spoke for about 92 minutes in a primetime nomination acceptance speech Thursday that went past midnight.

""Michael Beschloss pointed out that [former Soviet Premier Nikita] Khrushchev and Castro tended to give long stem-winders, kind of incoherent ones, as they were aging, and it's symptomatic of a party that indulges in a cult of personality that has put all its chips on the persona of one individual and their frailties and strengths."" 
MSNBC host Joy Reid said that she Googled the length of Castro's longest speech during Trump's nomination remarks for comparison.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a longer, more detailed statement through its spokesperson Oren Marmorstein, who posted on social media platform X that ""Israel rejects the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that was published today regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""

""Unfortunately, the Court’s opinion is fundamentally wrong,"" Marmorstein wrote. ""It mixes politics and law. It injects the politics of the corridors of the U.N. in New York into the courtrooms of the ICJ in The Hague.

""The opinion is completely detached from the reality of the Middle East: While Hamas, Iran and other terrorist elements are attacking Israel from seven fronts … with the aim of obliterating it, and in the aftermath of the greatest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, the opinion ignores the atrocities that took place on October 7, as well as the security imperative of Israel to defend its territory and its citizens,"" Marmostein continued.
""It should be emphasized that the opinion is blatantly one-sided,"" Marmostein added. ""It ignores the past: The historical rights of the State of Israel and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel.

""It is impossible to overstate the legal perversion from this U.N. Court,"" Bayefsky said. ""It was read out by its president, who is a politician from Lebanon (whose name was on the ballot to be the prime minister of Lebanon in the last two elections), a country that doesn't even recognize Israel's right to exist. Incredibly, the court openly states it didn't need to find any specific facts in violation of international law before reaching its conclusions, including before making the slanderous claim that Israel is guilty of the crime against humanity of apartheid. It took the court all of four mini-paragraphs to reach the apartheid conclusion.
""The U.N. and its kangaroo court says it knows best — the same U.N. that today is controlled by a vicious antisemitic majority, elects the judges and chooses the poison, in this case, legal farce — which, make no mistake, has one goal: to devastate and destroy the Jewish state.""
Israel already suffered a legal blow from the International Criminal Court, a separate legal governing body in the Netherlands, in which Prosecutor Karim Khan filed applications for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in addition to leaders of Hamas.

FOX_31,Trump's lengthy RNC speech ripped by 'The View': 'Too bad' bandage wasn't 'over his mouth',https://www.foxnews.com/media/trumps-lengthy-rnc-speech-ripped-the-view-too-bad-bandage-wasnt-over-his-mouth,2024-07-20 02:40:02.833596,politics,"The hosts of ""The View"" called former President Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention ""narcissistic"" ""xenophobic"" and ""beneath"" the dignity of the office.
Former President Trump's address at the Republican National Convention on Thursday in Milwaukee was met with brutal reviews from the liberal co-hosts of ""The View"" on Friday morning.
Co-host Ana Navarro, a staunch defender of President Biden, claimed the over-90-minute speech exhibited Trump's ""cognitive decline."" She hoped the media and Washington would turn its attention away from Biden's age concerns and put its scrutiny on Trump instead.
""If Joe Biden had been up there giving that speech, men in white coats would have interrupted him and carted him off and put him in a padded wagon,"" Navarro lamented. ""I thought today I would wake up and the TV would be full of like, doctors talking about Donald Trump's cognitive decline. I thought it would be full of Republicans hanging their heads in shame like Democrats did.""
""It's too bad the bandage was just over his ear. It should've been over his mouth,"" she quipped as the audience chuckled.

Co-host Sunny Hostin leveled an accusation of xenophobia against the former president for his immigration rhetoric and calling the COVID-19 virus the ""China virus"" during the speech. She also criticized Trump for making digs at his political rivals at various points in the speech.
The speech felt ""performative"" instead of unifying, and it was ""beneath the dignity of a national convention from the nominee of a major party,"" Hostin said.
""It was a xenophobic, ugly vision of America speech,"" she continued.
Co-host Joy Behar also found room to criticize the former president's remarks about God's providence in sparing his life in the assassination attempt. 
She claimed that Trump had been too self-centered in giving God credit because a man in the audience had been killed in the shooting.
""When something like this happens to you, like this assassination attempt, and you say something like, ‘God was watching me,’ that is a very un-Christian thing to say because he's very narcissistic. What about Corey? What's his name? The fireman who also got killed. What about all those guys who got killed on Sandy Hook?"" she asked.
""Oh, 'God was watching me and not watching them'? There's something very disturbing about that,"" she scoffed.

""There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet, in a certain way, I felt very safe, because I had God on my side,"" Trump said in his RNC speech. ""The amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at the very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark, and I would not be with you tonight."" 
""I am not supposed to be here tonight. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God. Many people say it was a providential moment,"" he added.
During his address, Trump also honored Corey Comperatore, the Pennsylvania firefighter who was tragically killed in the assassination attempt, as well as rallygoers David Dutch and James Copenhaver, who were seriously injured in the attack.
""Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, and seriously wounded two other great warriors. David Dutch and James Copenhaver. I spoke to all three families of these tremendous people — our love and prayers are with them, and always will be,"" Trump said. 
""Corey, a highly respected former fire chief... was accompanied by his wife Helen... and two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets... what a fine man he was,"" he added.

FOX_32,Campaign chairs say Biden is both 'more committed than ever' to presidential race and 'asking for input',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/campaign-chairs-say-biden-both-more-committed-than-ever-presidential-race-asking-input,2024-07-20 03:00:02.964619,politics,"WSJ editorial page assistant editor James Freeman joined 'America's Newsroom' to react to the report as the president faces growing calls to step aside. 
President Biden's top campaign advisors both weighed in on Friday to comment on widespread speculation surrounding the 2024 presidential race.
The first clarification came from Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who left no room for question during an interview with MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""
""The president's in this race,"" O'Malley Dillon told the hosts. ""You've heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why, because Donald Trump is not going to offer anything new to the American people. He's the same person he was in 2020. He's the same person he was at the debate stage.""

O'Malley Dillon made clear there was no question that Biden is ""more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump"" — pushing back yet again on weeks and weeks of leaks and speculation claiming the president was close to pulling out of the race.
""We believe in this campaign we are built for the close election that we are in, and we see the path forward,"" O'Malley Dillon continued. ""The president is the leader of our campaign and of the country, and he is clearly in our impression, and what we've built, and in our engagement with voters, he's the best person to take on Donald Trump and prosecute that case and present his vision versus what we saw last night.""
This rock-solid statement of commitment was slightly complicated just hours later by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. — co-chair of Biden's re-elections campaign — who said the president is ""weighing what he should weigh.""

Coons told the press during a panel at the Aspen Institute's Aspen Security Forum that Biden is considering ""who is the best candidate to win in November and to carry forward the Democratic Party's values and priorities in this campaign.""
He noted that Biden attended the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington, D.C., this month after a ""very bad debate performance"" and that the president ""Did a press conference. Did campaign events. Did campaign rallies.""
""And there are folks still saying he is not strong enough or capable enough to be our next president,"" he continued. ""I disagree.""

According to Coons, ""There is a lot of concern and anxiety about this because the stakes are so significant. The consequences of this election are profound.""
Coons walked back this somewhat shaky comment just hours later with a post to social media professing total support for Biden's re-election effort.
""I fully support the President. He's told me he's in it to win it,"" Coons wrote on social media platform X. ""I'm with him 100% because I know he can beat Trump just like he did last time.""

FOX_33,MSNBC brings the crazy to coverage of Trump assassination attempt,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/msnbc-brings-crazy-coverage-trump-assassination-attempt,2024-07-20 04:06:02.845041,opinion,"MSNBC's Michael Steele was accused of pushing ""conspiracy theories"" when he was questioned if former President Trump’s ear was actually hit by a high-caliber bullet.
MSNBC once dubbed itself ""The Place For Politics,"" and trumpeted the slogan ""Lean Forward."" 
But after what we've heard out of that network over the past few days, and quite frankly, for the past two decades, MSNBC might as well call itself ""The Place To Lean Forward Into Crazy Conspiracy Theories.""
On July 13, we witnessed what could've been one of the most horrific events in American history: A former and likely future president, Donald Trump, was speaking at an outdoor rally in western Pennsylvania on a hot Saturday afternoon when an assassin's bullet struck his ear. Only a miraculous and perfectly timed turn of his head to read a chart prevented the bullet from entering Trump's brain.
MSNBC’s MICHAEL STEELE ACCUSED OF PUSHING ‘CONSPIRACY THEORIES’ AFTER QUESTIONING TRUMP'S EAR WOUND
Trump, after grabbing his ear as if struck by a giant mosquito, went down, and Secret Service agents swarmed him. A moment later, we saw the former president rise up and defiantly pump his fist to the crowd while imploring supporters to ""fight, fight, fight."" His ear and cheek were streaked with blood.
MSNBC host and former RNC chair Michael Steele questioned the idea of deporting millions of illegal immigrants, arguing that a nationally infamous murder is an isolated example. (MSNBC)
Anyone who watched this – and that's nearly everyone in the world at this point – would only logically conclude, having eyesight, hearing and a modicum of sanity, that Trump was, thankfully, not mortally wounded. They would also know that the key takeaway was that someone had just tried to kill him, and nearly succeeded. You would expect the reporting on such a dramatic a story that had written itself on national television would be sober, lucid and straightforward. 
But over at MSNBC, that simply was not going to happen. Credibility, integrity, and the aforementioned sanity be damned.
Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, now a Trump-detesting MSNBC analyst, questioned on the air if Trump had even really been shot. Instead, he floated the conspiracy theory that the bullet hit a teleprompter, shattering the glass, and therefore Trump was only hit with glass and not an actual bullet.
""What about reports that it may not have been a bullet which wounded him but glass from the shattered teleprompter?"" Steele asked.
In the same rant, Steele also demanded that Trump's medical reports immediately be released to prove that his ear actually had been hit by a bullet.
Two days prior to Steele tossing out this theory, left-wing fact-check site Snopes had already debunked the teleprompter speculation, noting they were all intact after the incident. The network should've pulled Steele off the air for such irresponsible talk, but we've learned not to expect accountability from the Peacock.

Enter Joy Reid, a primetime host with a long and storied history of lies and deceit, as documented here and here and here for starters, decided to take this one step further by implying that the whole assassination attempt was actually staged and choreographed for Trump's political benefit.
""I have many questions! Like where are the medical reports?"" she wrote on X this week. ""What caused Trump’s injury, and what was the injury? Shrapnel? Glass? A bullet? Where were the three attendees who were shot seated or standing relative to Trump?"" 
""Why was Trump allowed to stand and pose for photos?"" she also asked. 
You get where all this is going: They're saying that Trump was engaging in stolen valor. They're missing the point that even if Trump was ""only"" grazed by a bullet, he nearly died as a nation looked on.

It's no secret that many MSNBCers are infected with an incurable strain of Trump Derangement Syndrome, and have been since he announced his first run for the presidency in 2015. Their hatred has become so blinding that, amid one of the biggest stories of our lifetime, they have decided to sacrifice their own integrity and honesty for the cause of taking down Trump in November. 
MSNBC should finally tell the truth and call itself ""The Place to Lean Forward Into Conspiracy Theories,"" now... and for the foreseeable future.

Former New Jersey Republican governor and longtime Trump critic Chris Christie faced backlash from co-hosts of ""The View"" after declaring that he would not vote for either former President Donald Trump or President Joe Biden. 
In the wake of Trump’s choice of JD Vance as his running mate and his RNC acceptance speech on Thursday night, Christie argued on Friday that the former Republican president had failed his ""chance to be unifying,"" arguing he could have picked someone like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin as his vice president.
""I know you’re not voting for Trump, would you vote for a Democratic ticket?"" show co-host Ana Navarro asked shortly afterward.
""Right now, I’m not voting for either. I’m just not. I can’t. One guy is completely mentally incompetent to do the job —"" Christie replied as the co-hosts erupted.

""But you have to vote!"" co-host Joy Behar argued.
""No, I’m gonna vote down ticket. I don’t have to vote [for president], no!"" Christie said, standing his ground, as one co-host could be heard telling him, ""Yes, you do.""
""You cannot throw away your vote! I asked you the last time you were on, Chris, and you’re gonna sit this one out?"" co-host Sunny Hostin said, speaking over him.
Navarro grilled Christie, arguing that it was ironic he was telling Democrats to ditch their current presidential nominee when he planned to vote for neither. The former governor said he will maintain this position as long as Biden remains the Democratic nominee, but may change his mind if a better leading candidate is offered.
""I’m willing to consider anybody who presents themself as someone who will make the country better. Now, I’m not encouraged by Kamala Harris’ performance thus far,"" he said. 
When asked by Hostin why he was not a Harris fan, he said, ""’Why not?’ We only have like a minute-thirty. I don’t have enough time.""
When badgered about not yet committing to vote for Biden, Christie joked he would vote write in Joy Behar as his candidate of choice.

Hostin has been one of Harris’ most staunch defenders over the years, arguing that she is criticized because of her Black racial background or for being a woman, and claiming her widely-parodied word salads are actually a product of her legal background rather than gaffes. 
After Christie declared that the Biden-Harris ticket would not win in November, Behar asked if he would be willing to vote for a Harris-Joe Shapiro ticket, featuring the more moderate governor of Pennsylvania as the vice president.
""Don’t know. Let me see what they have to say,"" he said. 
When multiple hosts objected to this answer, he declared, ""I’m sorry that I care for what people stand for. I apologize. I’m not gonna pre-commit to it! Let them perform and earn my vote! People should have their vote earned!""

Fox News Channel scored a massive ratings victory on the final night of the historic 2024 Republican National Convention, capping a dominant week over its competition.
On the evening former President Trump accepted his party's nomination for a third time, Fox News drew more than 9.8 million viewers, with 1.9 million in the 25-54 age demographic, from 10:30 p.m. to midnight ET on Thursday, according to Nielsen data.

Fox News finished the RNC with 6.6 million viewers and 1.1 million in the 25-54 demo, during Monday through Thursday primetime (8-11 p.m. ET). The total day average for FNC saw nearly 3 million and 446,000 in the 25-54 demo, a double-digit increase across the board versus the 2016 RNC.

""The Five,"" the most-watched show this year on cable news, scored 4.2 million viewers and 413,000 in the demo at 5 p.m. ET, while ""Special Report with Bret Baier"" followed up the next hour with 3.8 million viewers and 438,000 in the demo.
Fox News Channel's coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention was a ratings smash. 
FIVE BIGGEST MOMENTS OF TRUMP'S SPEECH TO RNC
In his acceptance speech on Thursday, Trump somberly discussed the assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania and paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, a supporter who was killed in the shooting.
Trump made a call for unity in the address but also pivoted to sharply criticizing the state of the country under President Biden, whose own candidacy is in peril as some top Democrats seek to replace him on the ticket.
Pointing to inflation, the crisis at the nation's southern border with Mexico, and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and in Gaza, Trump argued that ""it is time for a change. We simply cannot sustain four more years of this administration.""

CNN_1,Many senior Biden officials believe he must drop out as he becomes increasingly isolated,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/joe-biden-candidacy-in-peril/index.html,2024-07-19 08:50:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden is more isolated than he has ever been, with many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believing that he must abandon his campaign for a second term – and soon.


            “The next 72 hours are big,” one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. “This can’t go on much longer.”
    

            In interviews with CNN, more than two dozen sources familiar with the dynamics inside the West Wing and campaign said there is now widespread acceptance that Biden remaining in the 2024 race is wholly untenable.
    

            “Everyone is saying it privately,” one senior Democrat said. “People see and feel the walls closing in.”
    

            Another top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become “exceptionally insulated and isolated” since the CNN presidential debate on June 27. Multiple sources said some of the most senior advisers to Biden – including adviser Anita Dunn, attorney Bob Bauer and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon – faced the ire of the president’s family in the aftermath of the debate.
    

            That has only had the effect of making Biden’s inner circle of advisers with free access to the president – which had already been famously small and impenetrable – even tighter.
    

            Three weeks after his disastrous debate performance that shocked even his closest aides, friends and Democrats across the party, a stunningly small number of his most loyal aides – chief among them, his decadeslong advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti – and members of the Biden family appear dug in along with the president. That tight circle has alarmed many Democrats who are questioning whether Biden is receiving realistic data about the plight of his candidacy.
    

            Deputy White House chief of staff Annie Tomasini, a longtime aide to the Bidens, joins Donilon and Ricchetti in forming a protective bubble around the president. Anthony Bernal, chief of staff to Jill Biden, has grown even more powerful during the deepening crisis and has tamped down any signs of dissent, two sources say, reporting any naysayers to the first lady. One person close to the inner circle of advisers said Tomasini plays no role in deciding who the president sees and speaks to.
    

            Ricchetti is more clear-eyed about the challenges facing Biden, two people familiar with the dynamic inside the West Wing said, largely because he remains the point person for lawmakers trying to send a message to the president. Amid a fury of speculation about Biden’s future, senior-most West Wing advisers to Biden told CNN Thursday night that they have had no discussions among themselves – or with Biden – about him dropping out of the presidential race.
    

            In response to questions about this story, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said Biden is “proud of the well-rounded team he has built.”
    

            “He has not made changes to the group of advisers he consults, who he trusts because they’ve demonstrated the integrity to tell the truth and keep the wellbeing of the American people front of mind,” Bates said.


            Campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said, “Here in HQ, we’re working really hard because on winning campaigns, you work really hard. There’s an immense sense of pride across our office, because we know how important and critical that work we are doing here is for the fate of our democracy.”
    

            Multiple sources also told CNN that the president’s recent response to bad polls has been to cast doubt on whether there is anybody else who would perform stronger than him. Meanwhile, meetings and phone calls with anyone that might come bearing bad news appear to have paused.
    

            “The phones just kind of stopped ringing,” is how one senior Democrat put it.
    

CNN previously reported that in a tense conversation between former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Biden within the last week or so where the two disagreed over polling, Pelosi asked for Donilon, a former pollster, to join the phone call to go over the data. A Pelosi spokesperson said Thursday the “feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the speaker may have had with the president.”
    

            “He doesn’t want to hear from anyone. He wants to hear from Mike Donilon and Steve,” one top Democrat close to the White House said.
    

            One person close to Biden’s inner circle insisted that Donilon and Ricchetti have been presenting a range of views to Biden and that the president himself has been speaking directly with numerous party officials to hear their feedback.
    

            And in a meeting with top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, Biden aggressively challenged the notion that Jeffries’ colleagues wanted him to step aside, according to a source briefed on the discussion.
    

            Unlike on Capitol Hill, where Democratic lawmakers have slowly begun to publicly voice their concerns – so far, 20 House Democrats have come out to call on Biden to drop out – White House and campaign aides have had little choice but to continue doing their day jobs. As Biden and his campaign aides continue to publicly insist that the president is not going anywhere, the mood in many corners of the White House and campaign has been of deep despair.
    

            “There is a lot of people who tell themselves – it is my job to do this,” one Democrat close to the White House said. “But privately, they feel differently.”
    

            Biden’s deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks on Thursday said the campaign is “not working through any scenarios” where Biden is not the presidential nominee.
    

            “Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket. He is and will be the Democratic nominee,” he said during a DNC news conference in Milwaukee.
    

            Biden’s stunningly halting debate performance – and the downward spiral of his candidacy since – has sparked serious discontent inside the White House, with plenty of fingers pointed at senior advisers. Officials in and out of the administration have quietly questioned the intentions of those in the president’s inner circle – and whether their choice to stay-the-course-at-all-costs stems from a fear of acknowledging they misread the situation or a desire to preserve their proximity to power.
    

            “This decision is not just about Biden,” a former aide who had worked with Biden for decades told CNN. “There are other senior advisers who are considering whether they played the right role in this.”
    

            The frustration with the president’s advisers has permeated all levels of the White House as staff wrestles with a lack of information and decisions about their own professional future.
    

            “Staff in general are just over the leadership here,” one White House official said.
    

            Multiple former administration officials have told CNN that there has been an uptick in resumes on their desks in recent weeks, as their former colleagues are starting to look for an exit plan in the private sector.
    

            As Biden spent Thursday out of sight, recovering from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware, he has been described by those who have spoken to him as being “receptive” to arguments to step away from his reelection bid, a senior Democratic adviser told CNN.
    

            Biden is in a “contemplative stage” as he isolates in Rehoboth Beach. A source familiar with the president’s mindset said that he is “thinking things through” and “deliberating” about how to proceed with his reelection campaign while he’s in isolation. He has privately acknowledged to others that there is a limited path, given the all the unfavorable data, the source said.
    

            This source said it’s unlikely the president will make any sort of announcement before the weekend and cautioned that anyone who thinks they know what Biden will ultimately do doesn’t actually know.
    

            That makes it an open question – frustratingly so, in the eyes of many Democrats – whether Biden has come to any new decisions about his future. But even if he does heed the calls to step aside, a cascading series of events would be set into motion that officials would need time for which to prepare.
    

            Inside the White House, senior administration officials are bracing for Republicans to call for Biden to resign the presidency if he doesn’t seek reelection. These arguments are one of the many complicating factors surrounding Biden’s decision.
    

            With Biden’s political future on the brink, the White House is fielding a steady stream of letters, telephone calls and message from Americans, too, from Democratic voters like Terri and John Hale.
    

            “It’s with utmost respect that we offer this conclusion – you cannot win this race,” the Hales, retirees from Ankeny, Iowa, wrote in a letter to the White House obtained by CNN. “Not because you are not the better man, but because the public – rightly or wrongly – now sees your age and perceived limitations as the main issue in the campaign.”

CNN_2,What would happen if Biden decided to leave the race?,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-19 08:40:00,politics,"
A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.


            A growing collection of congressional Democrats are calling on Joe Biden to end his reelection bid, following the president’s disastrous debate performance last month and his failure since to convince members of his own party that he can defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall.
    

            It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats’ presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party’s delegates means it’s very unlikely he’d be forced out of the race against his will.
    

            “This isn’t the ’60s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,” said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden’s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN.

Takeaways from CNN’s presidential debate with Biden and Trump


            That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson’s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination.
    

            Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats’ convention will return to Chicago in August.
    

            As we first wrote back in February, if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party’s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a virtual roll call).
    

            That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates – almost all of them currently pledged to Biden – allocated as part of the primary process.
    

            These delegates aren’t just pledged to vote for Biden; they’re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president’s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement.
    

            You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to head the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against Trump.
    

            Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom – who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday’s debate – challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick.
    

            On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the “superdelegates,” a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can’t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they’re free to vote on subsequent ballots.
    

            It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party’s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November.
    

            Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed.
    

Democrats – The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership.
    

Republicans – If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself.
    

            An in-depth Congressional Research Service memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party’s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party’s nominee.
    

            Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate’s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario.
    

            In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen. Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.)
    

            The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern’s second-choice running mate.
    

            If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important.
    

            Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway.
    

            The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky.
    

            Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president.
    

            There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?

CNN_3,Alabama has executed man convicted of killing delivery driver during a 1998 robbery attempt,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/keith-gavin-alabama-execution/index.html,2024-07-19 08:15:00,us,"
Atmore, Alabama (AP) — A man convicted of fatally shooting a delivery driver during a robbery attempt in 1998 was executed Thursday evening in Alabama.
    

            Keith Edmund Gavin was pronounced dead at 6:32 p.m. CDT following a chemical injection at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in southwest Alabama, authorities said. The 64-year-old inmate was convicted of capital murder in the shooting death of William Clayton Jr. in Cherokee County.
    

            Handling his own appeals, Gavin filed a handwritten request Wednesday with the US Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution. But the nation’s high court rejected his request without comment less than an hour before the scheduled 6 p.m. CDT start of the procedure. The state attorney’s general office had responded that the inmate’s arguments that a circuit court had wrongly rejected an earlier appeal were without merit.
    

            Clayton, a courier service driver, had driven to an ATM in downtown Centre on the evening of March 6, 1998. He had just finished work and was getting money to take his wife to dinner, according to a court summary of trial testimony.
    

            Prosecutors said Gavin shot Clayton during the attempted robbery, pushed him into the passenger seat of the van he was driving and drove off in the vehicle. A law enforcement officer testified that he began pursuing the van and the driver — a man he later identified as Gavin — shot at him before running away into the woods.

Alabama grants Muslim death row inmate’s wish to forgo autopsy after execution


            Clayton, 68, was retired from a job at a railroad company and was a Korean War veteran, according to a 1998 obituary published by The Birmingham News.
    

            At the time of the killing, Gavin was on parole in Illinois after serving 17 years of a 34-year sentence for murder, according to court records.
    

            “There is no doubt about Gavin’s guilt or the seriousness of his crime,” the Alabama attorney general’s office had written in requesting an execution date for Gavin.
    

            Alabama last week agreed in Gavin’s case to forgo a post-execution autopsy, which is typically performed on executed inmates in the state. Gavin, who was Muslim, said the procedure would violate his religious beliefs. Gavin had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop plans for an autopsy, and the state settled the complaint.
    

            A jury convicted Gavin of capital murder and voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. Most states now require a jury to be in unanimous agreement to impose a death sentence.
    

            A federal judge in 2020 ruled that Gavin had ineffective counsel at his sentencing hearing because his original lawyers failed to present more mitigating evidence of Gavin’s violent and abusive childhood.
    

            Gavin grew up in a “gang-infested housing project in Chicago, living in overcrowded houses that were in poor condition, where he was surrounded by drug activity, crime, violence, and riots,” US District Judge Karon O. Bowdre wrote.
    

            A federal appeals court overturned the decision which allowed the death sentence to stand.
    

            Death penalty opponents had delivered a petition Wednesday to Gov. Kay Ivey appealing to her to grant clemency to Gavin. They argued that there were questions about the fairness of Gavin’s trial and said Alabama was going against the “downward trend of executions” in most states.
    

            It was the 10th execution in the US so far this year and the third in Alabama, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Missouri also have conducted executions this year. The Washington, DC-based nonprofit takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions.
    

            The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked the state of Texas from executing an inmate 20 minutes before he was scheduled to receive a lethal injection.

    Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.


            If you look out onto the Dubai skyline, you’re likely to be admiring the work of Yahya Jan.
    

            He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city’s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels.
    

            Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, the Ciel Dubai Marina, colloquially called Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors — and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world’s tallest hotel.
    

            For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters – small for a building of that height.
    

            “It’s a property that’s very compressed,” he told CNN in 2021. “It’s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.”
    

            A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants.
    

            As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said.

            “This project is not just about architecture. It’s about architecture and engineering coming together,” he added. “That’s why I love the project so much. It … is my passion, the convergence of science and art.”
    

            Throughout the build, Jan said he has been “extremely involved” in the work. “When you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it’s over,” he said. “It’s a continuous process.”
    

            When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city’s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls.
    

            He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master’s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex.

            Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. “I got carried away with the excitement here,” he said.
    

            As for the Ciel Tower — named for the French word for sky — Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City.
    

            “The reason I like the fact that it’s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that’s the case certainly in my own life,” he said. “I’ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn’t think I would get a chance to do. So it’s been amazing.”

CNN_5,"Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, vulnerable Democrat up for reelection, calls on Biden to drop out of the race",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/jon-tester-calls-biden-drop-out/index.html,2024-07-19 09:54:00,politics,"
            Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat up for reelection in a deep-red state, has called for President Joe Biden to end his bid for a second term.
    

            ”I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,” Tester said in a statement Thursday. “And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.”
    

            Tester is the second Democratic senator to ask Biden to withdraw as the party’s presumptive presidential nominee. Earlier this month, Vermont Sen. Peter Welch called on Biden to “withdraw from the race” in a Washington Post op-ed.
    

            Tester’s announcement comes hours after CNN reported that many senior-ranking White House and Biden campaign officials now privately believe that the president must abandon his reelection campaign soon.
    

            “The next 72 hours are big,” one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. “This can’t go on much longer.”
    

            Democrats continue to wrestle with not only Biden’s reelection bid but also its ability to hurt the party in down-ballot races. CNN reported Wednesday that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told Biden that he could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House. In the Senate, Democrats and the independents who caucus with them have a difficult road to maintain their majority, with 23 seats to defend compared with just 11 for Republicans.

CNN_6,A highly unusual ruling to dismiss a case against 2 White nationalists is put on hold by a federal appeals court,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/22/us/rise-above-movement-ruling-on-hold/index.html,2024-07-19 09:32:00,us,"
    Editor’s Note: (7/18/24) Since this story was published in February, a federal appeals court reversed a lower court judge’s dismissal of the case against Robert Rundo and Robert Boman – clearing the way for the continued prosecution of two White nationalists suspected of inciting violence at political rallies.


            After a federal judge made the rare decision to dismiss a criminal case against two White nationalists suspected of inciting violence at political rallies, an appeals court on Thursday put the ruling on hold and one of the men was re-arrested.
    

            The appeals court stay came after the highly unusual ruling of US District Court Judge Cormac Carney to dismiss the case against Robert Rundo and Robert Boman, saying they were being selectively prosecuted while far left groups weren’t. The two men were under indictment for conspiracy, riots, and aiding and abetting.
    

            Rundo, who was released after the ruling, was taken back into custody by federal agents, a law enforcement official involved in the investigation told CNN Thursday.
    

            Rundo was believed to have traveled to the US-Mexico border after his release, a law enforcement source told CNN. The Justice Department obtained a warrant to take him back into custody, saying he was “an extremely serious flight risk.”
    

            Rundo will now remain in custody while the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals considers motions involving his release, according to court records.
    

            Court records show Rundo’s attorneys had signaled their intention to possibly request Carney’s intervention yet again in the matter involving their client, but in the new order the higher court blocked Carney and other judges from any further action while they consider the matter.
    

            “No lower court may order h﻿is release absent further order of this Court,” the Ninth Circuit commanded in their order.
    

            Rundo and Boman were allegedly members of the Rise Above Movement, RAM, which Carney described as “a group of far-right, white supremacist nationalists, who attended several rallies and protests during which they engaged in violent acts.”
    

            They were both indicted under the federal Anti-Riot Act – referred to by Carney as “a-once-rarely-used criminal statute.”
    

            The men are believed to have recruited and given combat training to like-minded members, then incited violence at political rallies in Huntington Beach and Berkeley, California, and in Charlottesville, Virginia.
    

            “Beginning around March 2017, (Rundo and Boman) agreed to riot at political rallies and organized demonstrations, where they would assault individuals they believed were associated with Antifa and related far-left groups,” Carney wrote.
    

            The defense presented a motion to dismiss the case, saying the men were the victims of selective prosecution.
    

            “It is not uncommon for a defendant to raise selective prosecution as a defense but it is extraordinarily uncommon for that defense to succeed because the defendant has to prove that other similarity positioned people were not prosecuted,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig.
    

            But Carney took exception to what he viewed as an imbalance by federal prosecutors in charging White nationalists with crimes under the Anti-Riot Act, but – in his view – not similarly charging far left agitators.
    

            “The government cannot prosecute RAM members such as Defendants while ignoring the violence of members of Antifa and related far-left groups because RAM engaged in what the government and many believe is more offensive speech,” wrote Carney.
    

            “By many accounts, members of Antifa and related far-left groups engaged in worse conduct and in fact instigated much of the violence that broke out at these otherwise constitutionally protected rallies to silence the protected speech of the supporters of President Trump,” Carney wrote, adding he viewed prosecuting far right rioters while ignoring far left instigators as “constitutionally impermissible.”
    

            “Such selective prosecution leaves the troubling impression that the government believes speech on the left more deserving of protection than speech on the right,” wrote Carney.
    

            Following widespread civil unrest in the country in 2020, federal prosecutors did bring more than 200 cases against individuals alleged to have engaged in violence during protests after the police killing of George Floyd. Some cases were for riot-related crimes and others for lesser offenses usually handled by local authorities, not federal prosecutors.
    

            At the time, then-Attorney General William Barr urged federal prosecutors to get tougher in bringing more cases, including exploring using a rarely used sedition law, but some federal prosecutors were taken aback by the notion of charging protestors with violating a law that makes it a crime to conspire to overthrow the government.
    

            Barr frequently lashed out at leftist groups, including publicly decrying Antifa, but despite his threats to go after the group, the Justice Department under his leadership did not bring widespread charges against so-called Antifa members – an amalgamation of individuals holding various views, which, unlike various neo-Nazi and White supremacist groups, has no formal leadership structure or membership.
    

            Attorneys for both Rundo and Boman did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for comment on the recent court action.
    

            Judge Carney is no stranger to controversial rulings. Late last year, he blocked parts of a California law that would have banned carrying concealed weapons in a multitude of public places.  And in 2014, he deemed California’s death penalty unconstitutional, calling the administration of the state’s system “dysfunctional.”
    

            Carney was once the chief judge of the Central District of California, but stepped down after making a racially insensitive remark about a top administrative official at the court, according to the Los Angeles Times.

CNN_7,UN says Israeli evacuation orders are making it harder to reach those most in need in Gaza,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/un-gaza-evacuation-displacement-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-19 09:11:00,world,"
            United Nations agencies say that a new round of evacuation orders by the Israeli military in Gaza has prompted the largest displacements since October – making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult than previously.
    

            The World Food Programme said in a post on X Thursday: “Many distribution points have had to shut down. Only a few bakeries remain operational. We urgently need increased deliveries of food and greater capacity to deliver hot meals.”
    

            A spate of evacuation orders issued  by the Israel Defense Forces in late June and earlier this month increased the number of people displaced in Gaza from 1.7 million to 1.9 million, according to a UN assessment.
    

            The WFP says it has provided more than 600,000 people in Gaza with food assistance this month, and more than 500,000 people with food parcels and wheat flour. But the agency also reported having to further cut rations in central and southern Gaza to ensure broader coverage for people who have been newly displaced.

            “WFP still needs to deliver more fuel to the bakeries and other services, so they can provide emergency support to displaced families,” it said. “Basic commodities are available in markets in southern and central Gaza – but are unaffordable for many people – the shortage of commercial goods means food is sold at astronomical prices.”
    

            On Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Israeli military had stopped all aid missions from going north of Wadi Gaza into central Gaza.
    

            “This means humanitarian workers were unable to reach any of the hundreds of thousands of people in need. It also made it impossible for them to collect supplies from the northern entry point of Erez West,” it said.
    

            The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating the movement of aid convoys in Gaza, COGAT, told CNN it was unaware of any halt to the movement of convoys from the south of Gaza into northern areas through Wadi Gaza.
    

            Gaza’s health sector remains under great stress. According to the World Health Organization, 15 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional, and 1,500 of the usual 3,500 hospital beds in Gaza are available – 600 of them in field hospitals.
    

            Both the International Red Cross and the Gaza Health Ministry underlined the challenges to providing health care on Thursday.
    

            “The ambulance and emergency system is no longer able to respond to all calls and missions to transport the wounded and injured,” the Health Ministry said because of a lack of ambulances, the arrest of paramedics by the IDF and a lack of gasoline.
    

            The Health Ministry said that primary health care was affected by shortages of about 60% of basic medications, as well as damage to many health centers, especially in Khan Younis in the south.
    

            It said infectious diseases continued to spread and had affected some 1.7 million people, and there was a shortage of blood units.
    

            One of the field hospitals under pressure is run by the International Committee for the Red Cross in Rafah, which is at capacity after “repeated large-scale casualties,” the ICRC Said Thursday, noting that a Saturday attack in Al-Mawasi resulted in children requiring treatment for shrapnel wounds.
    

            “The number of patients who had to be resuscitated after the large influx of injured on Saturday is inconceivable,” said the ICRC’s Dr. Pankaj Jhaldiyal.

CNN_8,Instant ramen and influencers: Inside the world of South Korean convenience stores,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/south-korea-convenience-stores-intl-hnk-dst/index.html,2024-07-19 09:57:00,world,"
            Imagine this: you need to pick up a package, top up your metro card, grab lunch and take out some cash.
    

            In most places, that would probably mean separate trips to the post office, the subway station, a restaurant and an ATM. But in South Korea, all that – and more – can be done at your nearest convenience store. And you probably won’t have to travel far to find one.
    

            South Korea has become the global king of convenience stores, both online and off – with social media influencers and tourists joining locals in flocking to a rapidly growing number of stores across the country.
    

            By the end of last year, there were more than 55,200 convenience stores in the nation of 52 million, according to the Korea Convenience Store Industry Association – roughly one for every 950 people.
    

            That’s more than the total number of McDonald’s branches worldwide – and gives South Korea the highest density of stores per capita, overtaking Japan and Taiwan, both also famous for their abundant and versatile convenience stores.
    

            “The convenience store industry in South Korea stands out for its remarkable density and innovative strategies,” said Chang Woo-cheol, a professor of tourism and the food service industry at Kwangwoon University in Seoul.
    

            “They have become an essential retail channel, with the second-largest share in offline retail sales in the country.”
    

            It’s a far cry from places like the United States, where convenience stores are usually attached to gas stations or strip malls and are rarely seen in residential areas, partly due to zoning laws. In large South Korean cities like Seoul, convenience stores are on every corner, sometimes with multiple outlets from competing companies dotting the same street.
    

            “Convenience stores are open 24 hours a day and play an essential role in our busy lives,” Chang added – calling the South Korean industry a “global success story.”
    

            There are a few things that set South Korean convenience stores apart.
    

            For starters, they are a one-stop shop offering everything from food and drinks to home goods and lifestyle services. At these stores, customers can charge their phones, pay utility bills, withdraw cash, make online orders and receive deliveries – and, at certain locations, even charge their electric scooters, exchange foreign currency and send international mail.
    

            “Convenience stores in Korea are not only a place where people can (sit) around a table amongst the clutter of beer cans on a late summer night, but also provide essential services,” said Deloitte Korea in a 2020 report, describing the country’s stores as “pampering their customers with extreme convenience.”
    

            Then there’s the food section – a wide variety ranging from instant miso soup to cup noodles in every flavor imaginable, snacks like kimbap and onigiri, and ready-to-eat meal kits.
    

            Combine that with in-store seating areas, microwaves and hot water dispensers, and these stores have become a go-to spot for office workers having a quick lunch, partygoers needing a late-night boost and students fueling up before grueling cram school classes.
    

            Demand has surged over the years as South Korea has urbanized, said Chang, the hospitality professor. More than 80% of the population now live in urban centers, with many residents leaving rural areas to settle down in fast-paced cities.

            Another factor is demographics. Fewer South Koreans are getting married or starting families, meaning there are more single-person households than ever – and often on tighter budgets, given the economic hardships facing many young adults.
    

            As of 2021, about 35% of all South Korean households were single residents, according to a McKinsey report released last March. And unlike couples or large families, who may prefer to cook at home and buy in bulk from grocery stores, single residents gravitate toward the cheap, easy option of convenience stores or ordering online.
    

            The Covid-19 pandemic contributed to this trend, with people preferring to order online or to buy things quickly from stores close to home, the report added.
    

            Companies have capitalized on this high demand by strategically opening shops inside other existing business venues or entertainment spaces. For instance, Seoul has convenience stores in karaoke bars and the city’s arts center, the Deloitte report said.
    

            All this has translated to huge profits. Between 2010 and 2021, Korean convenience store revenue leaped more than fourfold from $5.8 billion to $24.7 billion, surpassing traditional supermarkets and department stores, according to McKinsey, citing London-based market research company Euromonitor.
    

            These convenience stores aren’t just popular in real life – they’re also gaining traction on social media, reflecting the global phenomenon many call the “Korean wave.”
    

            South Korean exports have swept the world in the past two decades, from K-pop and Korean TV dramas to beauty products, fashion and food. In the past year, the global obsession with Korean items has turned its attention to the country’s convenience stores.
    

            A quick search on YouTube, TikTok or Instagram shows an endless supply of videos about Korean convenience stores. In these clips, influencers show off the in-store instant ramen stations, review snacks and drinks, or follow online trends such as only eating convenience store foods for a whole day.
    

            These videos have proved to be a winning strategy for their creators.
    

            Jiny Maeng, an Australia-based content creator who was born in South Korea, began making videos on the topic after seeing similar clips going viral online. They are her most-viewed content, with her top three YouTube videos racking up a total of 76 million views – and an additional few million views each on TikTok and Instagram.
    

            “Korea became a trend itself … on social media,” she said. “I guess that’s also why (convenience stores) are so popular, because people idolize going to Korea now, it’s just one of the dream locations people want to go to. So, seeing these videos kind of overtake online is a really cool experience for a Korean, actually.”

            Part of what audiences enjoy is the sensory satisfaction of Maeng displaying convenience store products, she said – including the crinkling of packaging being torn open or the rattle of plastic “ice cups” before they’re filled with drinks.
    

            But they were also popular among her Australian and American viewers for the sheer novelty factor, she said. Buying, cooking and eating instant ramen noodles at a convenience store is “mind-blowing” for those used to a more spartan, Western-style store, she said.
    

            She pointed to businesses in Sydney, where she lives, as an example. Many cafes and other stores close by 3 p.m. – ludicrously early by Korean standards. And while Australia has 7-Eleven stores, like in the US, they are usually attached to gas stations and have “very limited” processed food options like meat pies, sandwiches, donuts and slushies, she said.
    

            Chang, the professor, said these online videos have helped drive the popularity of convenience stores in Korea. “It’s a combination of both their distinctiveness and effective marketing through social media that has boosted their popularity,” he said.
    

            Indeed, Korean convenience store companies have grown so successful they are even expanding overseas. Three of the largest brands – CU, GS25, and Emart24 – now have stores in parts of Southeast Asia including Vietnam and Malaysia, he said.
    

            He urged the industry to continue expanding by leveraging social media and “the influence of the Korean wave,” adding: “We will have to put in more effort to survive in this (global) competition.”
    

            There may be limits to the online strategy; the internet is now oversaturated with videos about Korean convenience stores, and audience interest is declining, said Maeng, whose most recent videos about the topic haven’t raked in as many views as before.
    

            But when she next returns to South Korea, she will “definitely” still visit a convenience store and hit record, she said.
    

            “There (are) always ways to utilize the trend to make it your own,” she said. “Maybe there’s a different way I can use convenience stores in my videos so it resonates with the viewer even more.”

CNN_9,Fact-checking night 4 of the Republican National Convention,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/politics/fact-checking-night-4-republican-national-convention-trump/index.html,2024-07-19 10:20:00,politics,"
            The final night of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. President Donald Trump is expected to speak later in the evening.
    

            CNN’s Facts First team is fact checking the program, and this story will be updated throughout the night.
    

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was “closed” during Donald Trump’s presidency.
    

Facts first: Pompeo’s claim is false. 


            While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions.
    

            The former president’s biggest effort to “close” the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial “Remain in Mexico” policy.
    

From CNN’s Devan Cole


            For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use “every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,” including voting by mail. Trump relentlessly disparaged mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has continued to sharply criticize it during the current campaign
    

            But Trump’s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would “once and for all secure our elections” as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, “We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.” And he said, “Keep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it’s the only thing they do well.”
    

Facts First: Trump’s claims are nonsense – slightly vaguer versions of his usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen and that Democrats are serial election cheaters. The 2020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump’s opponents excel.


            The Trump administration’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post-election November 2020 statement: “The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.”

            Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday evening that under former President Donald Trump’s administration, “not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across” the US.
    

            “We’d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,” Pompeo said.
    

Facts First: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.


            Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a “domain awareness gap” allowed the balloons to travel undetected.
    

From CNN’s Haley Britsky


            Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. “Instead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,” she said.
    

Facts First: This characterization of Trump’s tariffs is misleading. 


            It’s true that Trump’s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies – not China.
    

Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
    

            Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer.
    

            Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers.
    

            “A tariff is just a form of a tax,” Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year.


            Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture.
    

            For example, Trump’s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector – but that industry lost jobs.
    

Federal Reserve economists found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That’s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus, retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad.
    

From CNN’s Katie Lobosco


            A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan’s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980.
    

            At one point, the video featured Reagan’s voice asking if, compared to four years ago, “Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?” On-screen text answered the question with the words “allies no longer trust the United States,” attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine.
    

Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn’t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that “critics of President Joe Biden” make the “claim” that allies no longer trust the US after Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan – but the article then went on to argue that “these concerns about credibility are overblown.”


            The convention video also featured Reagan’s voice asking, “Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?” But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
    

            There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret “four years ago” more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

CNN_10,"Seattle officer fired for ‘cruel comments and callous laughter’ following Indian grad student’s death, police chief says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/us/seattle-police-officer-fired-jaahnavi-kandula/index.html,2024-07-19 10:26:00,us,"
            A Seattle police officer has been fired over the “dehumanizing laughter” and “cruel comments” he made after the 2023 death of an Indian graduate student who was struck by a police vehicle, the police chief says.
    

            Seattle interim Police Chief Sue Rahr terminated former officer Daniel Auderer on Wednesday and justified her decision to the department in an internal email, attaching the department’s disciplinary action report alongside it.
    

            “There is no doubt that the named officer’s cruel comments and callous laughter about the tragic death caused deep pain to Ms. Kandula’s family, but also immeasurable damage to the public trust of police in the Seattle community, across the nation, and around the world,” Rahr wrote in the internal memo, noting many in the community said Auderer’s “dehumanizing laughter” heard on video was “more outrageous and disturbing” even than Kandula’s death.
    

            “It is my duty as the leader of this organization to uphold the high standards necessary to maintain public trust,” Rahr wrote. “For me to allow the officer to remain on our force would only bring further dishonor to the entire department.”
    

            On January 23, 2023, Jaahnavi Kandula, a 23-year-old graduate student from Andhra Pradesh, India, was fatally struck by Seattle Police Officer Kevin Dave’s police patrol vehicle while she on a crosswalk. Eight months after the incident, police released body-worn police camera footage that captured a phone conversation in which Auderer, the day after he was sent to the scene to examine if the officer whose vehicle hit her had been impaired, can be heard laughing, saying Kandula’s life had “limited value.”

            “But she is dead,” Auderer says on the body-worn camera footage, apparently in response to the person on the phone.
    

            “No, it’s a regular person,” Auderer then says. Moments later, he replies: “Yeah, just write a check” and laughs.
    

            “Yeah, $11,000. She was 26 anyway,” he adds, mistaking Kandula’s age. “She had limited value.”
    

            CNN has reached out to Auderer for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
    

            The video’s release last year sparked outrage across the nation, especially within the South Asian diaspora – inspiring rallies, meetings with elected officials and online petitions demanding justice for Kandula. It also grabbed the attention of onscreen celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar and Lilly Singh, who posted online about her death.
    

            Auderer, who is also vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, “intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers,” he wrote in an August 8 letter to the city’s Office of Police Accountability released by the Seattle Police Officers Guild. “I was imitating what a lawyer tasked with negotiating the case would be saying and being sarcastic to express that they shouldn’t be coming up with crazy arguments to minimize the payment.”
    

            CNN has reached out to the Seattle Police Officers Guild for comment.
    

            “I believe the impact of his actions is so devastating that it cannot be mitigated by his intent to keep his conversation private,” Rahr wrote in her email to the police department. “The hurt his words have inflicted on Ms. Kandula’s family cannot be erased.”
    

            “The actions (of) this individual police officer have brought shame on the Seattle Police Department and our entire profession, making the job of every police officer more difficult,” she continued.
    

            The body-worn camera footage was provided to the King County Prosecutor’s Office as part of the fatality case, according to Rahr. The office announced in February it would not file criminal charges against Dave – whose patrol vehicle struck Kandula – saying it “lacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Kevin Dave was impaired by drugs or alcohol, driving in a reckless manner, or driving with disregard for the safety of others.”
    

            The city’s Office of Police Accountability recommended in January that Auderer be terminated following an investigation that found the officer violated the department’s standards and duties policy and bias-free policing policy, a spokesperson told CNN.
    

            Kandula was from the Kurnool District in Andhra Pradesh and spoke Telugu, the president of the Telugu Association of North America, Niranjan Srungavarapu, previously told CNN. The group helped return her remains to India in January, he said.
    

            She had come to the United States in 2021 to pursue a master’s degree in information systems in the College of Engineering at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus, according to the school. She would have graduated in December.
    

            “Jaahnavi, a young soul full of dreams and hopes, came to the United States with the aspiration to pursue her master’s degree and be a beacon of support for her family,” the association said in a statement to its Seattle community and members. “Her future was a shining light, cruelly extinguished.”

CNN_11,Frontier and other airlines were at a standstill for hours after a massive Microsoft outage,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/business/frontier-airlines-microsoft-outage/index.html,2024-07-19 10:43:00,us,"
            A significant Microsoft outage brought low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines and some competitors to a standstill for hours after a regulator halted departures. The ground stop was lifted late Wednesday night.
    

            “Our systems are currently impacted by a Microsoft outage, which is also affecting other companies,” Frontier said in a statement on its website. “We appreciate your patience.” The company was offering refunds to inconvenienced passengers.
    

            The Federal Aviation Administration said Frontier asked it to pause the airline’s departures across the United States. A little after 10 pm ET, the FAA lifted the ground stop on Frontier.
    

            The airline has cancelled 131 flights Thursday and delayed 223 others, making up nearly 30% of its overall flights, according to data tracker FlightAware.
    

            Allegiant and SunCountry also said on their websites that they were having difficulties.
    

            “Due to a global outage at a third party vendor, our booking, check-in, and trip-managing capabilities are temporarily unavailable,” SunCountry said on its site.
    

            “The Allegiant website is currently unavailable due to the Microsoft Azure issue,” Allegiant said.
    

            Microsoft on its Azure cloud software status report site, said that around 6 pm ET, the service went down for some customers in the Central US region – “including failures with service management operations and connectivity or availability of services.” The company said it determined the cause and is working to fix it. A company spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

            Other airlines were unaffected by the outage. United, Southwest and American Airlines said they were not impacted by the outage.

    Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.


            Hamas-led armed groups committed “numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity” against civilians during the October 7 attack in southern Israel, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report released Wednesday.
    

            In a 236-page report titled “‘I Can’t Erase All the Blood from My Mind’: Palestinian Armed Groups’ October 7 Assault on Israel,” the rights watchdog said that the October 7 attack was “directed against a civilian population,” and that “killing civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.”
    

            “The Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at HRW.
    

            The assault was led by Hamas’ military wing – the Qassam Brigades – but included at least four other Palestinian armed groups, the report said.
    

            The report details several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at most civilian attack sites on October 7, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            The rights group said it interviewed 144 people, including 94 Israeli and other nationals, who witnessed the October 7 assault, which targeted at least 19 kibbutzim (agricultural communes) and five moshavim (cooperative communities). The cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals, and a beach party were also targeted, HRW added.
    

            “The armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes,” the report said. These include “attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, willful killing of people in custody, cruel and other inhumane treatment.” Palestinian fighters committed summary killings and hostage-taking along with murder and wrongful imprisonment, HRW added.
    

            The report also highlighted “crimes involving sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation and despoiling bodies, use of human shields, and pillage and looting.”
    

            Israel and the United Nations have also accused Hamas-led militants of committing sexual violence on October 7.
    

In March, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said her team found “reasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred” that day. It was the UN’s most definitive finding on allegations of sexual assault in the aftermath of the attack.

Israeli hostage speaks out on sexual assault in Gaza


            Several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN in December that the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed.
    

            HRW said that Hamas responded to its questions, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. “In many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary,” the watchdog said.
    

            Hamas rejected the findings of the report and called for it to be retracted, according to a statement on Wednesday.
    

            “We reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology,” the Palestinian group said.
    

            In response to the October 7 attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of Gaza’s population of 2 million, turned swathes of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.
    

            Previous HRW reports have addressed several alleged serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7. In its Wednesday report, HRW called on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law.
    

            “The Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage,” the report said, adding that both parties “should surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.”
    

            In May, the ICC said it was seeking arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among other Israeli and Hamas officials, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza.  A case is also being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza.
    

            “Atrocities do not justify atrocities,” Sawyer said. “To stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it’s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account. That’s in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.”

CNN_14,Europe faces a hostile Russia and the prospect of an isolationist US. Unity is more crucial than ever,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/europe-russia-isolationist-us-unity-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-19 10:13:00,world,"
            Just hours before the black SUVs carrying dozens of European leaders crunched across the gravel of Blenheim Palace on Thursday, Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance put the US’s foreign partners on notice.
    

            “Together we will make our allies share in the burden of securing world peace,” he said at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. “No more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.”
    

            That wasn’t even the most strident rhetoric we’ve heard from the junior senator from Ohio, who voted against the US supplemental aid package for Ukraine that passed in April. In February, he told the Munich Security Conference “the American security blanket has allowed European security to atrophy,” arguing that in a world where munitions manufacturing is limited, the only option for Ukraine is a negotiated settlement.

Why Europe looks at Trump’s VP pick with anxiety


            Vance was echoing the GOP’s presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has long criticized NATO and accused partners in the security alliance of failing to pay their fair share. The former president has also hinted at paring back military aid to Ukraine and claimed that he could have the war settled through negotiation in 24 hours if reelected.
    

            And yet the mood among European leaders arriving in the rolling Oxfordshire countryside is one of resignation, and resolve.
    

            “I think whoever wins the US race… it will be more America first,” Belgium’s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told CNN. “And I think the only answer to that is Europe needs to stand on its own legs… what we see in the Republican convention confirms that.”
    

            Finland’s President Alexander Stubb, the head of one of NATO’s newest members, has read Vance’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” describing it as “very good.”
    

            On the isolationist leanings of a Trump-Vance ticket, he is circumspect. “Am I worried? No. Because the United States wants to remain a superpower,” he told CNN.
    

            “Is there a rebalancing going on? Yes. Europe needs to take care of its defense more.”
    

            Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen argues Europe stepping up its commitment to its own security has nothing to do with the US. “We have to be more capable of defending ourselves, with a more and more aggressive Russia, not only when it comes to Ukraine,” she told CNN. “It’s every day now that we’ve seen hybrid attacks, cyber attacks, disinformation.”
    

            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, just two weeks into the job, was hoping the Thursday summit involving 42 European heads of state or government would be a strong show of unity, “a signal to Russia of our resolve.”
    

            And yet one EU leader has signaled something quite different to Russia. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has never supported military aid to Ukraine, chose the first week of his rotating EU presidency this month to visit President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, on what he called a “peace mission.”

            The visit was about fulfilling his “Christian duty” Orban told CNN on Thursday. “I try to do my best to convince everybody that peace is better than a war… it’s not easy to convince them.” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, reelected Thursday to another five-year term, called the trip “an appeasement mission.”
    

            Speaking at the meeting at Blenheim Palace, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was blunt. Preserving European unity is critical to a long-lasting peace, he said. “But if someone in Europe tries to resolve issues behind others’ backs… if someone wants to make some trips to the capital of war… then why should we consider such a person? The EU and NATO can address all their issues without this one individual.”
    

            Europe did manage a show of unity, but one that faces mounting tests, including the prospect of a new US administration that may pull its support for Ukraine, and an increasingly active Ukraine-skeptic in its midst.

CNN_15,DOJ says ‘substantial progress’ made toward final plea agreement with Boeing but needs more time,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/business/boeing-doj-plea-deal-hnk-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 12:00:00,us,"
            The Justice Department said on Thursday that it has made “substantial progress” in finalizing an agreement with Boeing to plead guilty to defrauding the US government, but more time is needed to work out the remaining details.
    

            Earlier this month, Boeing (BA) agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes. The agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences.
    

            The Justice Department and the plane maker had planned to file the final terms of the agreement with a federal court in Texas on Friday. But, prosecutors said Thursday in a status report that they “will not be able to finalize the agreement by tomorrow” and that the earliest it will happen is next week.
    

            The government wrote in the status report: “Based on the work that remains to be done, and accounting for the corporate formalities attendant to finalizing the plea agreement, the Government expects that the earliest it could file the plea agreement is Wednesday, July 24, 2024.”
    

            The Justice Department added that it “will continue to work expeditiously in an effort to file that day, but if it cannot, it will submit instead a further status report to apprise the Court of the parties’ progress.”
    

            Boeing will pay up to $487 million in fines, a fraction of the $24.8 billion that the families of crash victims had wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families oppose the deal, the department said in early July.
    

            The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor, a person to be chosen by the government, for a period of three years. But that oversight and the fine did not satisfy the families of victims, according to one of their attorneys.

CNN_16,"Largest housing provider for migrant children engaged in pervasive sexual abuse, US says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/housing-provider-migrant-children-sexual-abuse/index.html,2024-07-19 12:03:00,politics,"
            Employees of the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the US repeatedly sexually abused and harassed children in their care for at least eight years, the Justice Department said Thursday, alleging a shocking litany of offenses that took place as the company amassed billions of dollars in government contracts.
    

            Southwest Key Programs Inc. employees, including supervisors, raped, touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning in 2015 and possibly earlier, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit filed this week. At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.
    

            It was not immediately clear how many children are currently in Southwest Key’s vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment beyond the lawsuit announcement when asked whether the department recommended that children be removed from the shelters or that the the nonprofit’s contracts be terminated.
    

            “In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,” the lawsuit states. “In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children’s vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.”
    

            In a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.
    

            The nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters – 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company’s largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.
    

            The provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government’s response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump’s administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.
    

            The Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.
    

            Health and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key’s care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.
    

            The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities have received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider’s shelters since 2015.
    

            Among the lawsuit’s allegations: An employee “repeatedly sexually abused” three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker “repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their ‘private area,’ and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.”
    

            The lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider’s shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.
    

            Children were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.
    

            Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint “raises serious pattern or practice concerns” about Southwest Key. “HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,” he said in a statement.
    

            Southwest Key Programs Inc. spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said “does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.”
    

            Texas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.
    

            The lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department’s request to lift special court oversight of HHS’ care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden’s administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.
    

            Special court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.
    

            Leecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are “absolutely disgusting” and blamed Texas’ revocation of licenses for “a powder keg waiting to explode.”
    

            “While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,” said Welch, deputy legal director of Children’s Rights.
    

            Neha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations “profoundly disturbing and shocking.”
    

            “I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm’s way,” said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.
    

            The Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton. The attorneys general of Arizona and California declined to comment on the litigation.

            University of Florida president Ben Sasse announced late Thursday that he will leave his position of nearly two years to focus on taking care of his family after his wife was diagnosed with epilepsy.
    

            In a post on the social platform X, the former US senator from Nebraska said that “after extensive prayer and lots of family tears,” he asked university officials that day to start looking for a new president. In a statement, the university said his resignation is effective July 31.
    

            “I need to step back for a time and focus more on the needs of my family while we rebuild more stable household systems,” Sasse said, adding that he would continue to teach at the university.
    

            Sasse’s wife, Melissa, who had an aneurysm and a series of strokes in 2007, was recently diagnosed with epilepsy and has been having “a new batch of memory issues,” he said.
    

            “We’ve battled some nasty seizures the last couple years, but she’s always remained a warrior,” he said.
    

            The couple has two daughters in college, and their youngest child is turning 13, he said.
    

            Sasse, a Republican, left the senate last year after being named the 13th president of the university.
    

            While in the Senate, he was a prominent critic of former President Donald Trump who joined with a handful of other Republicans to vote in favor of conviction his impeachment trial after the 2021 Capitol riot. That led to criticism from within Sasse’s own party even though he voted with Trump 85% of the time and helped get his three Supreme Court nominees confirmed.
    

            The chair of the university’s board of trustees, Mori Hosseini, thanked Sasse for his leadership.
    

            “He has left a lasting impact on the university and all of those associated with it. We wish Ben all the best as he steps back to focus on his family,” Hosseini said.
    

            Sasse thanked the university for welcoming his family and said he was grateful for the professors and students as well those behind the scenes, like third-shift maintenance crews and the early morning cafeteria workers.
    

            “We love you. You touched our hearts and made this more than a job — you made it our community,” Sasse said. “That’s why we’re not going anywhere.”

            An explosion near the US Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv that killed at least one person early Friday is being investigated as a possible drone attack, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            The blast, which occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, killed a 50-year-old man and injured at least eight others, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. Four people sustained shrapnel wounds, it added.
    

            The blast occurred about 100 meters (330 feet) from the compound of the US Embassy branch office, according to a CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene.
    

            The United States is closely monitoring the situation, a government official told CNN, acknowledging that an explosion happened near the branch office. It does not appear that the building was damaged, another US official said.
    

            The Israel Defense Forces said it is looking into reports that it was an aerial attack, possibly from a drone. Police officers and bomb disposal experts are on the scene, according to Israeli police.
    

            Emergency crews responded to an “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, the MDA said.
    

            “The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said.
    

            Police urged local residents “not to touch any rocket remnants that may contain explosives.”
    

            “Following the incident of an explosion in the Tel Aviv area, large police forces have arrived at the scene and are working to secure the area and conduct searches for suspicious objects and additional threats,” the Israeli Police spokesperson’s unit said.

            The Olympic Village welcomed the first athletes on Thursday ahead of the Summer Games in Paris.
    

            International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach was on hand to tour the nearly 134-acre village in Saint-Denis, France. Approximately 10,500 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team are expected to reside at the village.
    

            “Finally, we are here. It has been a long journey these seven years, but it has been a hugely rewarding one. We have a wonderful Olympic Village, and all the ingredients for a great Olympic Games are here,” Bach said on Thursday.
    

            “The venues are not only breathtaking, they are of the highest standard. You feel how the enthusiasm in France is growing, and I hope you have the same feeling.”
    

            Bach was joined by Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet and IOC Coordination Commission Chair Pierre-Olivier Beckers-Vieujant as they toured the village during their visit.

            Once the Paralympics conclude on September 8, the village – which contains 82 buildings – will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people, organizers previously said.
    

            The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city’s historically impoverished northern suburbs.
    

            The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River.
    

            Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing.
    

            The Opening Ceremony for the Summer Olympics will be held on July 26. The Games will run through August 11.

CNN_20,Bangladesh has erupted over jobs reserved for the children of ‘freedom fighters.’ Here’s what you need to know,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-19 13:33:00,world,"
            Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes between students, pro-government supporters and armed police fueling widespread anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory.
    

            Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities.
    

            State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
    

            Mobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

            Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government’s quota system, which reserves more than half of civil service posts for certain groups.
    

            Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation’s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler.
    

            Many of the country’s contemporary political elite are related to that generation – including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975.
    

            The reserved roles are linked to job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina’s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit.
    

            “A government job is a really good opportunity,” said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. “About 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It’s not easy.”
    

            Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has “widened in urban areas.” In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education.
    

            In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case.
    

            Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth.
    

            “The freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation … for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,” said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. “But there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota … has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.”
    

            The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades.
    

            The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League – the student wing of the ruling Awami League party – reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus.
    

            Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after “widespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.”
    

            The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd.
    

            “Someone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,” he said. “One of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.”
    

            Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: “There are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.”
    

            CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah.
    

            Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting 32 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data.
    

            Authorities have also moved to block online communications.
    

            Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a “near-total national internet shutdown” across Bangladesh on Thursday. “The new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,” it said on X.


            The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks.
    

            Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court.
    

            “I especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,” Hasina said in a news conference Thursday.
    

            But she has been accused of enflaming protester anger by reportedly calling them “razakar,”  an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war.
    

            “We expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,” said protester Salman Farsi. “What did the students do to deserve this tag?”
    

            Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system.
    

            “This is a people’s movement against the authoritarian government,” Hossain said.
    

            “This is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn’t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.”
    

            Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere, including in New York’s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen.

CNN_21,Putin’s summer residence gets new air defenses as Ukraine steps up drone attacks,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/putin-summer-residence-fortification/index.html,2024-07-19 16:00:00,world,"
            As Ukraine grows bolder in striking targets deep inside Russia, Moscow has quietly upped the security measures around President Vladmir Putin’s country residence north of Moscow.
    

            Satellite images have revealed that several Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have been installed in the vicinity of the presidential residence on Lake Valdai in Novgorod region.
    

            The Valdai residence could be a high-profile target, as Putin is known to be spending time there during the summer. The palatial property sits inside a large government vacation resort in the Valdai national park, on a peninsula wedged between two lakes. Access to the whole complex is severely restricted – the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park.
    

            First reported by Radio Liberty, satellite images show the Russian-made Pantsir-S1s have been moved into the area at some point between last September and this May, just as Ukraine became better at developing and using drones capable of striking deeper inside Russia.
    

            Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show air defenses strategically positioned in the area, including on a tower located deep in a forest just a few kilometers away from the compound.
    

            The Pantsir-S1 systems are designed to combat short-range cruise missiles and drones, suggesting the move to station them near the residence may be a response to Ukraine’s increasingly audacious drone attacks.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment but has not received a response.
    

            Kyiv has recently been given permission to use Western weapons to strike across the border into Russia, but this is limited to military targets that are near the border with the Ukrainian Kharkiv region and are supporting Russia’s offensive in Ukraine.
    

            For any strikes deeper into Russia than that, Ukraine must rely on its own weapons. Drones are a big part of the strategy.
    

            Ukraine’s drone program has grown significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. What began with efforts to modify cheap, off-the-shelf drones that could be used for surveillance has turned into the development of long-range attack drones that are capable of striking hundreds of miles beyond Ukraine’s borders.
    

            So far this year, Kyiv has claimed that Ukrainian drones sank or severely damaged several Russian warships in the Black Sea and caused damage to the Kerch Strait bridge between Russia and Ukraine’s Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

UN says ‘high likelihood’ a Russian cruise missile hit Ukraine’s main children’s hospital


            The Ukrainian military has also managed to destroy fuel depots, military targets and energy infrastructure much further afield. In April, it said its drones hit the Niznekamsk oil refinery – one of the five largest in Russia – in Tatarstan region, more than 1,100 km (700 miles) from the border. And last month, the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed one of Russia’s newest and most advanced fighter jets, the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, with a drone strike almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines.
    

            “Ukrainian drone strikes deep within Russia continue to pressure Russia’s air defense umbrella and force the Russian military command to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to cover what it deems to be high-value targets,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based group, said in a battlefield update on Wednesday, pointing to the decision by Russia to move the Pantsir-S1 systems there.
    

            The presidential residence is well protected from would-be invaders. Access to the complex is severely restricted – the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park.
    

            A special permit is required to access the wider park and the resort is completely off-limits – according to its official website, it has been closed indefinitely since last November.
    

            The retreat’s history as a vacation destination for Russia’s top officials dates back to the time of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who had a dacha – or summer house – built in the area, according to the Russian Presidential Property Management Department, the body that manages the holiday complex. Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin both enjoyed time at the residence, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti.

CNN_22,Yemen’s Houthi rebels claim deadly Tel Aviv drone attack,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-19 15:33:00,world,"
            Yemen’s Houthi rebels on Friday claimed responsibility for a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv, the Iranian proxy group’s latest attack in what it says is a response to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
    

            The explosion in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, including a US Embassy branch office, killed a 50-year-old man and injured at least 10 others, according to Israeli emergency officials and police.
    

            Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare’e said the “significant military operation” was successfully carried out with a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            CNN cannot independently confirm the Houthi spokesperson’s claim.
    

            The drone that caused the explosion was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to “human error,” an Israeli military official said.
    

            The drone was armed with a “warhead” and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device’s payload.
    

            The official did not confirm whether the drone was launched by the Houthis.
    

            The Israeli military is investigating the attack and does not believe further threats are imminent, the official said.
    

            According to an initial inquiry “no sirens were activated” during the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier, adding that the air force had increased air patrols in response to the incident.
    

            The blast occurred about 100 meters (330 feet) from the compound of the US Embassy branch office, according to a CNN analysis of open-source satellite imagery of the scene.
    

            There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or “locally engaged staff,” the US State Department said.
    

            “We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,” the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.
    

            Emergency crews responded to an “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.
    

            “The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said.
    

            At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said.
    

            Police urged local residents “not to touch any rocket remnants that may contain explosives.”
    

            “Following the incident of an explosion in the Tel Aviv area, large police forces have arrived at the scene and are working to secure the area and conduct searches for suspicious objects and additional threats,” the Israeli Police spokesperson’s unit said.
    

            The Houthis have been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 people and saw more than 250 others kidnapped.

The shipping industry is sounding the alarm as another vessel sinks in the Red Sea


            Israel’s air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip’s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.
    

            The war has also raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea for instance have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes.
    

            The drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.
    

            The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

CNN_24,This couple’s hobby? Illegally scaling the world’s tallest buildings together,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/style/skywalkers-rooftopping-documentary-culture-queue/index.html,2024-07-19 16:29:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Keeping you in the know, Culture Queue is an ongoing series of recommendations for timely books to read, films to watch and podcasts and music to listen to.


            What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme “rooftopping” adventures — where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower — skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China’s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117.
    

            At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn’t know they’d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles — and thousands of feet in the air — together.
    

            Eight years later, the documentary film “Skywalkers: A Love Story” takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement.
    

            Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus bravely accuses his girlfriend of being “too negative” as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair’s unusual lifestyles, “Skywalkers” becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that’s your thing.
    

            Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, ”Skywalkers” debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau’s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship.
    

            “It’s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,” Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. “Angela first told me that they were… competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.”
    

            As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur’s Merdeka 118, the world’s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder.
    

            In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the “supertall” skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme — one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower’s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.)
    

            Rooftopping is a contentious pastime — both for the danger it poses and participants’ reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban “sport” emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed.
    

            For “Skywalkers” the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team’s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple.

            “We talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, ‘Please, don’t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,’” Zimbalist said. “Because to us, this isn’t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb… the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.”
    

            For the couple, rooftopping isn’t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity.
    

            “The higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,” he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. “This extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it’s essential for me.”
    

            Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not  about “defending what they do against critics.”
    

            Instead, he hope that ”Skywalkers,” in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers’ “polished” social media posts.
    

            “With any activity that’s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,” he said. “Telling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.”
    

            Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work.
    

            “The fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,” she explains in one clip.
    

            So while the makers of “Skywalkers” would probably rather you don’t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare — and say “yes” to the thing that scares us the most.

            So begins the 1981 Oscar-winning film “Chariots of Fire,” introducing a group of British athletes as they train for the Olympic Games.
    

            The runners – whose t-shirts and shorts are muddied with sand and sea – splash through shallow water towards the Scottish coastal town of St Andrews, which slowly appears as a series of spires and rooftops on the horizon.
    

            The scene is embedded in cinema history, memorably capturing the quiet beauty of striding across a deserted beach. The simple joy of running will become a central theme of the film, even though the athletes’ faces are now a mixture of hardship, happiness and gritty determination.
    

            “What’s beautiful about athletics as opposed to almost any other sport is its lack of complexity,” David Puttnam, the producer of “Chariots of Fire,” tells CNN Sport. “You’re throwing something, you’re jumping over something or you’re running. It’s a quintessence, really, of human effort.”
    

            It’s perhaps for this reason that the film, more than four decades after its release, remains as popular and relatable as ever.
    

            Based on the lives and gold-medal-winning performances of sprinters Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams ahead of the 1924 Paris Olympics, “Chariots of Fire” won four Oscars – including Best Picture. It has been ranked among the greatest British films of all time, and was a favorite of former and current US presidents Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden.
    

            As the Olympics return to Paris this year, public viewings have been held in several countries, offering a timely reminder of how “Chariots of Fire” still carries a charming appeal and uplifting – even life-saving – message.
    

            “After the film came out, I must have got – and this is not an exaggeration – at least half a dozen letters from people who said that the film had made them decide not to commit suicide, that life was worth living,” says Puttnam.
    

            “The film has got a way of really, really speaking to people … something much more than we envisaged or probably had been put into it. It’s got a life of its own.”
    

            “Chariots of Fire” charts the athletic careers of Liddell and Abrahams – both talented sprinters – in the years leading up to the 1924 Olympics.
    

            Liddell is a kindly figure with fierce religious beliefs, a missionary in his native Scotland who withdraws from the 100 meters at the Olympics because the heats are held on a Sunday. Instead, he enters – and wins – the 400 meters, despite having limited experience of running the longer distance.
    

            This moment forms the emotional climax of “Chariots of Fire,” as Liddell, played by Ian Charleson, describes how his running has become bound up with religion: “God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure.”
    

            A Scottish rugby international before he was an Olympic champion, Liddell has been celebrated for his selflessness as well as his sporting feats. He was born in China and returned there to serve as a missionary teacher after the Olympics, mostly remaining in the Asia until his death in a Japanese internment camp 20 years later.
    

            “I had a lot of room in my heart for him,” former Scottish sprinter Allan Wells, who won 100m gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, tells CNN Sport. “He’s a very special person and put himself out there big-time, really. It’s a huge legacy and we should remember him.”
    

            Wells recalls being asked after his race in Moscow if he’d like to dedicate the victory to Abrahams, Liddell’s counterpart in “Chariots of Fire” and, until then, the last British man to win 100m gold.
    

            “It was basically throwing it down my throat,” he says. “I thought for two or three seconds and I said, ‘No, if I did it for anybody, I did it for Eric Liddell.’ Thankfully, there were three Scottish reporters at the back of the room and they all had their thumbs up for me.
    

            “I think there is an attachment, but he [Liddell] was much more special than I was … Maybe 20, 30, 40 years after I’ve gone, they’ll still be remembering Eric Liddell before they remember Allan Wells.”
    

            Liddell’s philanthropic legacy lives on through The Eric Liddell Community, a dementia care charity based in Edinburgh with a focus on the elderly, loneliness and isolation.
    

            This year, the organization has launched The Eric Liddell 100 initiative, intended to make Liddell’s life better known among younger generations while recognizing his acts of heroism after Japan’s invasion of China in 1931.
    

            “When he was in China, apparently he told people to pray for the Japanese – and they were the people who were holding them in the internment camp,” Sue Caton, Liddell’s niece and a patron of the Eric Liddell Community, tells CNN Sport.
    

            “He thought everybody was important. He’d never have dismissed anybody, no matter who they were or what they had done because he felt that’s what we should do.”
    

            John MacMillan, chair of the Eric Liddell Community, concurs, even noting how some people in China have embraced Liddell as their first unofficial Olympic gold medalist.
    

            “He was obviously a determined individual, he was a committed individual, and he clearly put the needs of others before his own,” says MacMillan. “He’s remembered as a bit of a Robin Hood figure.”
    

            Abrahams makes a striking counterpoint to Liddell in “Chariots of Fire,” his conviction and strength of personality no less forceful.
    

            The film also presents Abrahams’ faith as a motivating factor in his running career. Antisemitism forms the backdrop of his time as a Cambridge student and his athletic ability is described as “a weapon … against being Jewish.”
    

            “I attached so much importance to my athletics as a means of demonstrating that I wasn’t inferior,” Abrahams, who died three years before the release of the film, once said in an interview with the BBC in the 1960s.
    

            “This played a very big part in my life. I think one exaggerates it – there was a certain amount of antisemitism when I was a young man, there’s a certain amount now. But I was so bent on demonstrating my superiority that I banked everything on athletics.”
    

            Running, for Abrahams, was all-consuming, so much so that he frequently became anxious and obsessive about his performances – a detail captured by actor Ben Cross in “Chariots of Fire.” He tells coach Sam Mussabini on the eve of the Olympic 100m final: “I’ve known the fear of losing, and now I’m almost too frightened to win.”
    

            Abrahams’ nervous, uneasy relationship with racing was almost self-destructive.
    

            “Harold Abrahams was an extremely neurotic man, and to say he was highly strung is almost an understatement,” author Mark Ryan, whose book “Chariots Return” charts the lives and influence of Liddell and Abrahams, tells CNN Sport.
    

            “He went through absolute hell before races, borderline full-on nervous breakdowns. The fear was expectation, that people had come there to see him win, but they would also laugh if he lost.”
    

            Liddell’s early-career nerves, on the other hand, disappeared over time.
    

            “He quickly got over that when he realized that he could connect his running to his Christianity in his mind,” adds Ryan, “and then just all the pressure fell away. He still hated losing, but if it was God’s will that he didn’t win, he didn’t win. It was all for the glory of God, and what will be will be. That was a wonderful mindset to take into any race, I think.”
    

            Abrahams badly injured his leg doing the long jump the year after the Paris Olympics, forcing him to retire from athletics. He went on to become an influential journalist, broadcaster and athletics administrator, and he remains one of only three British men to win the Olympic 100m title.
    

            “Chariots of Fire” has prevented the achievements of Liddell and Abrahams from being lost in time, but the film is not a precise portrayal of their lives.
    

            Liddell, for instance, decided not to run the 100m long before the Games, unlike the 11th-hour decision presented in the film. His bronze medal in the 200 meters is also passed over, while the athletes’ training in the opening scene happened not in St Andrews but Broadstairs, a town in the south of England.
    

            Puttnam, who has acknowledged the film’s artistic license, says that he never foresaw its success, not least because of the budget constraints – he had $6 million at his disposal – and many logistical hurdles.
    

            When it came to the Oscars, he was indifferent about attending and never expected that he’d walk on the stage to collect the award for Best Picture.
    

            “I remember getting up, my knees going all wobbly and going down [to the stage],” he says. “I hadn’t had my hair cut – it’s this shot of me trying to push my hair into some sort order because if I thought I was going to win, I probably would have got my hair cut.”
    

            The filming of “Chariots of Fire,” much like preparing for the Olympics, was an arduous process. The actors trained for six weeks under veteran Olympic coach Tom McNab just to be in shape to film the running scenes, while Nigel Havers – who plays Lord Andrew Lindsey – fell and broke his wrist while learning to hurdle.
    

            “If you ever meet him, his wrist is on the wonk,” says Puttnam. “He knew if he went to a doctor, we’d have to recast the film, so he didn’t tell anyone … I’ve always been in awe of his courage.”
    

            Courage, fittingly, is central to “Chariots of Fire” – be it Liddell’s decision not to bow to the pressure of running on a Sunday or Abrahams’ conquering of his pre-race nerves ahead of the 100m final. And while the film is about devotion, commitment and an unbridled love of running, it is also, somewhat cynically, about winning.
    

            “Would I have done it if Liddell won a silver medal? The answer’s no, I wouldn’t,” muses Puttnam. “It wouldn’t be the point.”
    

            History, so the saying goes, is written by the victors – and that seems an apt message for one of the most iconic sports films ever made.

CNN_26,A tale of two presidents as Trump claims his triumph and Biden’s hopes begin to fade,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/trump-rnc-biden-2024-analysis/index.html,2024-07-19 17:59:00,politics,"
            Thousands of supporters chanted “fight, fight, fight” and pumped their fists Thursday night as Donald Trump basked in the love of the new Republican Party he built and that hails him as a superhero touched by God.
    

            States away, Joe Biden sat isolated and sick in his Delaware beach house as the party he led to victory just four years ago turned on the 81-year-old president and the possibility grew that a humiliating final chapter may be opening in a storied political life.

Takeaways from the final night of the Republican National Convention


            Trump and Biden have been locked in a bitter political clash ever since Biden vowed to launch a battle for the soul of the nation when White supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, seven years ago.
    

            Their fates diverged sharply Thursday. Trump accepted the nomination of a united party convinced it’s cruising to victory in November, while Democrats splintered, with some fearing that their president could lead them to a landslide defeat after a cataclysmic debate performance sent his reelection campaign into freefall three weeks ago.
    

            Trump spoke on the last night of the Republican National Convention at the end of a week that he might not have lived to see after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt – the second stunning twist in three weeks in a suddenly transformed election campaign.
    

            “Just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended, we know that,” Trump said. “And yet here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much, it’s called America,” he declared.
    

            “We live in a world of miracles.”
    

            As the former president wistfully told the story of the horrific moment he came under attack in a Pennsylvania park on Saturday, he displayed rare vulnerability and reflection. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump told the crowd, which broke into a spontaneous chant of “yes you are, yes you are!”
    

            The eyes of people high in the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks’ arena glistened with tears as Trump described how he heard a “loud whizzing sound” and felt something hit him “really, really hard on (his) right ear.” He survived, he said, because he had “God on (his) side.”
    

            All week, Republicans have carved a narrative of an iron man of destiny who would drag a wounded America up off the dirt, just as he rose bloodied from his brush with death and held up a fist of defiance.
    

            But Trump’s aides promised their candidate had also changed in the aftermath of a shooting that wounded him in the right ear — and would respond to his new lease on life with a message of national reconciliation and unity. And early in his remarks, Trump did reach for a vision of national renewal. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.”
    

            But the new Trump lasted just a few minutes before the old version returned. Soon, the ex-president was ranting about weaponized justice, claiming falsely that foreign nations were sending people from their mental asylums over the US border and accusing Democrats of cheating in elections.
    

            The ex-president then tried to recreate the dystopian atmosphere of his searing 2016 convention speech – though the comparison with the intense night in Cleveland eight years ago served to underscore that Trump is eight years older and not quite the ferocious rhetorical force he once was.
    

            In the end, it was the same old speech full of untruths and rhetoric that alienates moderates that has left Trump deeply unpopular with half of America.
    

            The once and possibly future president painted a nostalgic and idealized vision of his term and accused Biden of driving into a ditch a country he himself left deeply divided and economically diminished. And he warned that perceived weakness abroad had created great danger. “Our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III and this will be a war like no other,” said Trump.
    

            On a night dedicated to unity, the divisiveness of Trump’s warm-up acts undercut the message, hinting at the hardline authoritarian undercurrent of the “Make America Great Again” movement that might characterize the second term of a former president who thinks he is entitled to unchecked power. Wrestler Hulk Hogan painted Trump in the light of a developing third-world dictator wielding unaccountable power.
    

            “All you criminals, all you low-lives, all you scumbags … what you gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you brother?” Hogan roared.
    

            In an election that could be won by invigorating the Republican base — with the help of new MAGA favorite JD Vance as his vice presidential nominee — Trump’s stark speech may serve its function. But it was hard to see how it would please swing voters and its tedious length, at 1 hour 32 minutes, stretched well past primetime. And for the Americans wondering how to pay for health care, how to afford a house or to send their kids to college, Trump offered no new details of what he’d actually do in a second term.
    

            Trump’s low-energy delivery in the vast arena was far less compelling that many of his campaign rallies, and it represented the most undisciplined, off-script moments of the entire convention. To be fair, he just survived an assassination attempt. But at times, in an election that is increasingly turning on the vulnerabilities of Biden’s age, Trump looked every bit of his 78 years – and his rambling remarks could serve to embolden Democrats who believe that a more vigorous candidate on their side could thwart the ex-president’s hopes of becoming only the second defeated one-term president to return to office.
    

            Still, in an age of social media and viral moments, it may not matter much that Trump went on so long. The most striking moments of the night – the ex-president’s grand entrance against a huge backdrop of lights reading “Trump,” his scripted recollections of the assassination attempt and video of the ex-president huddled with his grandchildren in his box may be all that most Americans remember – and represented valuable imagery for a campaign that is already ahead.
    

            But there was also plenty for Democrats to fault and work with. And combined with Biden’s troubles, the second half of the speech may have served best to illustrate one of the defining characteristics of the election: Americans are deeply unimpressed with either option.
    

            The speech followed a day of extraordinary developments in Biden’s ailing reelection campaign, which has foundered since his faltering debate performance that validated the concerns of millions of voters who doubt he’s fully fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86.
    

            Compounding his political woes, Biden this week has been forced to retreat to his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with a case of Covid-19, at a moment when many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials have come to believe the president must abandon his campaign for a second term.
    

            “The next 72 hours are big,” one Democratic governor in close touch with party officials relayed to aides on Thursday. “This can’t go on much longer.”
    

            “People see and feel the walls closing in,” one senior Democrat said, CNN also reported.
    

            Another top Democrat close to the White House described Biden as having become “exceptionally insulated and isolated” since the CNN debate in Atlanta on June 27.
    

            In a critical sign of the party’s down-ballot concerns, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, who faces the toughest reelection of any incumbent, became the latest senior Democrat to say Biden should step aside.
    

            “I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong. And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.”
    

            Biden has argued that he’s still the best Democratic hope to beat Trump – and, on the evidence of a keynote convention address on Thursday, the ex-president indeed looks beatable.
    

            But increasingly, events suggest that ﻿the mission may be entrusted to another, yet-to-be identified Democrat.

CNN_27,Taylor Casey’s loved ones are keeping hope alive a month after the Chicago woman disappeared in the Bahamas,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/taylor-casey-bahamas-missing-chicago/index.html,2024-07-19 17:43:00,us,"
            It’s been a month since anyone reported seeing Taylor Casey.
    

            She was last spotted near Paradise Island in the Bahamas on June 19. Still, her loved ones are making sure she is being seen – by publicly campaigning for her safe return.
    

            Chicagoan Casey is described by friends and family as someone who defies “boundaries and definitions,” and a person “everyone notices when she enters a room.”
    

            When members of her community gathered July 11 to mark Casey’s 42nd birthday, plead with Bahamian police to keep searching for her and ask federal agencies to provide assistance, the event included balloons, snacks, games and bubbles.
    

            One reason support for finding Casey has been so monumental is that she is an “amazing, amazing friend,” said Jacqueline Boyd, Casey’s close friend and “chosen family” member for 17 years.

            “Anybody that has been in a room with her is really, really devastated right now, personally impacted and motivated to action,” Boyd told CNN. 


            “And it is fully a reflection of how Taylor shows up for us.”
    

            Casey is an artist, a hairstylist, an Air Force veteran, a community worker and a woman of faith, Boyd said.
    

            She was born in south suburban Harvey, Illinois, and most recently lived in Rogers Park in Chicago.
    

            Casey had worked at the Chicago Freedom School as a program manager developing youth programs and had done some work with Howard Brown Health in HIV testing and prevention, her close friend Emily Williams told CNN.
    

            “Taylor’s favorite things are flowers and gardens and just peace,” said her mother, Colette Seymore. “Taylor is a very gentle spirit. Taylor just loves people, loves to help people, cares about people, cares about justice (and) fairness.”
    

            “Love is an action,” Seymore said. “It’s not just a word … and Taylor was good for that (and) showing you that she loved you.”
    

            Seymore told CNN she and Casey have outings together to carnivals and restaurants and go on nature walks.
    

            She recounts a time she didn’t know Casey had stopped by her house until Seymore got a call.
    

            “She called me and said, ‘Mom, look outside your door.’ And I looked outside my door, and it was one little flower,” Seymore said. “Taylor had come and planted a flower on the side of my side door.”
    

            Casey was getting a yoga instructor certification at Sivananda Ashram Yoga when she went missing. She was last seen at the ashram and was reported missing when she didn’t show up for morning classes on June 20.
    

            Nature, especially the beach, was Casey’s “place of peace,” and why her circle was so excited to see her go to the ashram, said Williams. “Taylor had been looking forward to it for a long time, and it seemed really idyllic.”
    

            Williams said she wishes “we could have been there to protect Taylor.”
    

            Police found her phone in the water near a boating dock on June 24, but have been unable to access its contents, authorities said. Investigators in the Bahamas asked American authorities for help unlocking the phone, but they also had no luck, Police Commissioner Clayton Fernander said at a news conference.
    

            It’s unclear where the Royal Bahamas Police Force investigation stands. CNN has reached out to the Bahamian police for comment and has received no response. According to Seymore and Williams, they have received minimal updates from authorities. However, they thanked the staff for US senators from Illinois for keeping in contact with them.
    

            Casey’s family were told to expect an update last week from the Bahamian authorities but have not heard back, according to Williams and Seymore.
    

            A July 14 statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Consul General of the Bahamas notes the Royal Bahamas Police Force is cooperating with the family and conducting a full and thorough investigation, which remains open.
    

            “We want to receive these updates about the full investigation that they’re doing and the thorough work that (they’re) doing. We want to hear that. The fact of the matter is that we haven’t heard that from them. So, I think that that’s telling,” Williams told CNN.
    

            “This, for us, is about finding Taylor. It’s not about anything else,” she continued. “Everything that we have talked about (and) everything that we have shared has been with the intention of finding Taylor.”
    

            Casey is described as a “fixture of Chicago’s transgender community,” in a news release shared July 10 on a social media account dedicated to finding her.
    

            “Taylor’s disappearance has sent shockwaves through Chicago’s LGBTQ+ community,” the release read.
    

            The first week or so after Casey’s disappearance, Boyd said, was filled with “confusion and shock.” Yet, the first order of business was to make sure there was a thorough investigation.
    

            Casey’s loved ones chose to wait until widely sharing Casey’s gender identity in connection with her case.
    

            Amid the devastation and initial communication with authorities, Boyd said family and friends asked themselves: “How can we talk about the person we love so much whose gender is more complex than most people can understand – and do that lovingly?”
    

            They decided that during “shock and grief (was) not the time,” Boyd said.

            “I can’t even express to folks who are not part of the community how frequently we lose our women (and) how frequently our Black trans women are just gone, usually due to some form of violence or something really, really unfortunate happening,” Boyd told CNN.
    

            “You’re really hoping against hope that there’s some other reason why this person’s gone. So, protecting her privacy (and) protecting her ability to speak for herself about her own gender – that she never wanted on a national stage – for me, that was top priority.”
    

            Boyd said Casey’s gender is more to her than just that of a transgender woman, adding how others understand their own gender is “deeply personal.”
    

            “While Taylor is a Black trans woman, there are worlds within that that are not a neat compartmentalization,” Boyd said, explaining that Casey’s views are more “gender expansive.”
    

            Many close to Casey believe her gender identity has impacted the investigation.
    

            For a missing young White woman, Williams says, there is much media coverage and resources. “Taylor is just as deserving (of that),” she told CNN.
    

            Apart from Casey’s return, Boyd hopes the ongoing investigation will lead to getting involvement and assistance from federal authorities. That way family and friends “can know every stone has been turned over,” she said.
    

            The US State Department is aware of reports of a missing US citizen in the Bahamas, a spokesperson told CNN but declined to comment on Casey’s case specifically.
    

            When a US citizen is missing, the department works with local authorities and communicates with families openly, the spokesperson said.
    

            When asked for comment, the FBI referred CNN to the Royal Bahamas Police Force.
    

            For Seymore, every day gets harder. “When somebody dies, the longer it is (and) as time goes by, it gets easier. Not really easier, but it gets easier,” she said. “But this is not getting easier for me … I wake up every morning just so sad.”
    

            She does have hope and believes Casey is alive, added Seymore. It also puts “a smile on (her) face” when she thinks of all the community work her daughter has done.
    

            “I hope that people take this opportunity to have a different conversation about how we see each other and understand each other’s identities,” Boyd said. “That’s my other hope; that Taylor is honored from a place of letting people be curious, nuanced and open to seeing people as a whole person, not just one identity.”
    

            Williams takes solace in the fact that Casey is “strong” mentally and physically. “I believe that it’s those things that are keeping her alive and that would give us the best chance of finding her and bringing her home,” she said.
    

            “Taylor doesn’t give up. Taylor is not a person that just gives up,” Seymore told CNN.
    

            Seymore also hopes to get the financial resources to hire a lawyer and a private investigator since “the people over in the Bahamas are not doing all that they can to find my child, so we need help.”
    

            “Taylor is somebody who we all keep looking for … this is not going to drop. Chicago is a city of workers and organizers, and we are ready to do absolutely everything we can to find her, and she deserves that. She deserves that from our country,” Boyd said.

CNN_28,China economy: Key meeting offers few clues on how to tackle worsening downturn,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/china-plenum-economy-downturn-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-19 17:42:00,us,"
China’s ruling Communist Party has set ambitious long-term policy goals at its most important political meeting on reform, but offered little detail on how to pull the world’s second-largest economy out of a worsening downturn.


            In a behind-closed doors meeting known as the third plenum, more than 360 members of the party’s Central Committee — including the most senior political and military leaders and heads of state-owned enterprises — held talks from Monday to Thursday at a hotel in Beijing.
    

            According to a communique released Thursday, discussions at the plenum — traditionally held every five years — centered on how to deepen reforms in a wide range of areas and advance “Chinese-style modernization,” a broad ideal for the country’s development backed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
    

            Xi, who hosted the meeting, has laid out a longterm vision to build a more equitable, innovative, and greener economy — under the tight control of the party — by 2035.

            But while the communique outlined broad goals such as boosting technology self-sufficiency, improving social welfare and deepening reforms of the fiscal, taxation and financial systems, global investors were left disappointed by a lack of detail on how China would address the most pressing issues plaguing its economy — from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis facing municipalities around the country.
    

            “There are few signs that the just concluded third plenum marks a major change in the direction of policymaking,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics, at Capital Economics on Friday.
    

            While it offered few clues on how to tackle economic difficulties, the meeting did provide further insight into a shake-up of high-level personnel over the past year.
    

            Qin Gang, China’s former foreign minister who was ousted after only months in the job, was removed from the Central Committee after a “resignation,” but retained his Communist Party membership.
    

            By contrast, the meeting confirmed the expulsion from the party of former Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who was sacked last year and investigated for corruption, as well as two People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force figures Li Yuchao and Sun Jinming.
    

            Their removal – part of a sweeping purge within the top ranks of the military – came after the committee heard a report on their “grave violations.”
    

            Shortly after he came to power, Xi promised at the plenum in 2013 to give market forces a “decisive role” to play in the economy. But in the years since, his government has prioritized state-owned enterprises, implemented stricter regulations and overseen a sweeping crackdown on private businesses and wealthy individuals, as part of a wider campaign to curb the “excesses of capitalism” and fix “income inequality.”
    

            That has rattled the private sector, causing a plunge in investment and contributing to surging unemployment.
    

            Xi’s government has also strengthened its national security apparatus in the past decade, which has scrutinized more areas of the economy and targeted foreign firms in anti-espionage campaigns.


            The crackdowns have scared foreign investors and fed geopolitical tensions, leading to accelerated capital outflows.

            In the communique, officials pledged to ensure “security,” which means national security concerns could still drive policymaking, said Evans-Pritchard.
    

            They also vowed to give “better play to the role of the market,” while noting that market forces need to be better managed, and retained a previous promise to “unswervingly” develop the state sector.
    

            “The current leadership has a history of paying lip service to the idea of allowing greater market dynamism but failing to follow-through in practice,” Evans-Pritchard said.
    

            If past sessions are a guide, a more detailed report may be released in the following days, but for now, “the plenum communique is light on specifics,” Evans-Pritchard added.
    

            The third plenum names “high quality development” as China’s “top priority” and lays out structural reforms to be completed by 2029.
    

            Beijing has been pushing for self-sufficiency in core technologies as the United States and its allies curb the exports of key products like advanced chips to China. It has also viewed technology innovation as a new growth engine that could help the economy transition from the old model fueled by infrastructure investment and debt expansion.
    

            Policymakers also pledged to “improve people’s livelihoods” at the plenum, which is essentially a continuation of Xi’s “common prosperity” agenda.

            While previous leaders in post-Mao China were content to let some get rich first, Xi appears to believe the time has come to share the fruits of China’s development more widely among its population, Evans-Pritchard said.
    

            “This is arguably one of the most promising parts of the reform agenda, since channeling a greater share of income to households would help to advance a much-needed rebalancing toward consumption,” he said.
    

            The leadership also vowed to revamp the fiscal, taxation and financial systems, which signal their concerns about how to address the debt crises faced by local governments.
    

            Debt has piled up at China’s municipal governments, after three years of pandemic controls drained their coffers and the property slump led to a sharp decline in land sales, which they rely on for income. That poses risks to the country’s banking system and economic growth.
    

            Policy advisers and market analysts have been calling on Beijing to reform its fiscal system, allowing local governments to retain more revenues and reduce their dependence on land sales. There have also been calls for an overhaul of consumption tax to broaden local governments’ source of income.
    

            But the communique gave little detail on what measures could be rolled out on those fronts.
    

            “It will be key to watch for further development over the next two to three months,” said Bank of America analysts on Friday.
    

            Besides the long-term structural reform priorities, policymakers also vowed to achieve short-term economic goals, including a 5% GDP growth target for 2024.


            That came days after China released disappointing economic data for the second quarter of this year.
    

            GDP grew 4.7% year-on-year in the April-to-June period, marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. The figure slowed from 5.3% in the previous three months and missed the 5.1% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.

            To achieve the annual goals, “[we] will proactively expand domestic demand” and develop “new-quality productivity forces,” the communique said.
    

            That could mean channeling resources to favored sectors, such as high-tech manufacturing, while gradually curbing the role of sunset industries like property development, according to Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics.
    

            Analysts say that the coming months could offer more details on how Xi plans to revive the economy.
    

            Emphasizing short-term economic policies is rare in the history of the third plenums, said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group.
    

            As a result, policy stance could turn more expansionary in the second half of this year as policymakers have to defend the annual growth target, he said.

CNN_29,Corporate America’s retreat from social activism is well under way,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/corporate-activism-nightcap/index.html,2024-07-19 18:30:00,us,"
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.


            Corporate America gave social activism a go. Between 2020 and 2023-ish, it really seemed like the big guys were done with the old ways of ignoring societal injustices and keeping their eyes trained squarely on the bottom line.
    

            But like most trends, corporate activism moves on a pendulum. And right now, in the (Election) Year of Our Lord 2024, we are firmly on the backswing.
    

            Check out some of my colleagues’ headlines in recent days:
    

Bud Light loses more ground, slipping to No. 3 in America
    

John Deere backs away from diversity and inclusion efforts after a conservative backlash
    

Tractor Supply warned climate change and a lack of diversity would hurt business. Now it’s ignoring those risks
    

Target is dialing back on Pride merchandise after right-wing backlash
    

            To quote CNN contributor and rockstar journalist Kara Swisher: “As it turned out, it was capitalism after all.”
    

            Let’s back up a bit.
    

            There have always been socially conscious companies out there walking the walk. Your Patagonias and Ben & Jerry’s.
    

            But in the midst of America’s racial reckoning following the emergence of Black Lives Matter, years of protests and the murder of George Floyd, the idea of “stakeholder capitalism” — basically, that companies thrive when they focus not merely on chasing profit but also on supporting their employees and customers, and generally not destroying the environment — was showing up in surprising places.
    

            In 2018, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blew peoples minds when he wrote in his closely watched annual letter that businesses need to not only make money but also make “a positive contribution to society.” The following year, the Business Roundtable, a group of about 200 CEOs, signed a letter embracing a similar message.
    

            We’d come a long way from the days of Reagan-era “greed is good.” Some of it was just lip service, of course, and plenty of companies caught flak for trying to look progressive by slapping a rainbow flag on their Twitter profiles. But their hearts seemed to be in the right place.
    

            By 2020, the public outcry over Floyd’s murder made it impossible for companies to stick their head in the sand anymore. That’s when Corporate America went full-tilt into diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.
    

            That’s also when the far-right outrage machine started revving up.
    

            In 2022, Disney’s then-CEO Bob Chapek stumbled into the discourse over Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, pitting Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis against one of the state’s biggest employers in a saga that ultimately cost Chapek his job. It became cautionary tale for other CEOs: Support the LGBTQ community, of course. But tread lightly if you want to keep your job.
    

            Then came the Bud Light fiasco of 2023. In short: The brand did a one-off partnership with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Then a bunch of anti-trans people called for a boycott. And sales of Bud Light have taken a hit ever since. It went from the No. 1 to No. 3 beer in America.


            Bud Light didn’t handle fallout well — it capitulated to the angry mob and dropped Mulvaney even as she faced a barrage of threats. But we now know the “backlash” was a lot more than just a handful of anti-trans jerks swearing off their favorite beer and posting about it on TikTok. It caught fire as right-wing media fueled the swirl of negativity around Bud Light, framing it as “wokeism” gone amok.
    

            On Thursday, the Guardian reported that the Bud Light boycott was fueled in part by the right-wing activist Leonard Leo. Citing tax documents uncovered by the watchdog group Accountable.US, the British paper wrote that a group connected to Leo led a backlash effort “that generated threats against Mulvaney, violence against consumers and layoffs by Anheuser-Busch,” the Guardian wrote. (Leo declined to comment to the Guardian. CNN has reached out to Leo through the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group he co-chairs.)
    

            Bottom line: It is, of course, the nature of people and systems to revert to muscle memory. Corporate America has spent a lot more time chasing profit than it has effecting cultural change, and we can’t expect corporations to fix everything.
    

            It was easier for companies to stick their necks out in 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were near zero and customers were still loading up on goods faster than the supply chain could handle.
    

            But the blowback from the right, combined with higher interest rates and less ravenous consumer spending, has been enough to push major brands back to the sidelines.
    

            It is capitalism, after all.

CNN_30,"What is Crowdstrike, the company responsible for the global outage?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer/index.html,2024-07-19 18:18:00,us,"
            The global computer outage affecting airports, banks and other businesses on Friday appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by major US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday that the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory.
    

            CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies — detects and blocks hacking threats. Like other cybersecurity products, the software requires deep-level access to a computer’s operating system to scan for those threats. In this case, computers running Microsoft Windows appear to be crashing because of the faulty way a software code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with the Windows system.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack. Kurtz, in his post, said the issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem.
    

            CrowdStrike is perhaps best known for investigating the Russian hack of Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 US election. But the multibillion-dollar firm does business around the world through software sales and investigations of major hacks.
    

This is a developing story and will be updated.

CNN_31,Russian court to announce verdict in US journalist Evan Gershkovich espionage trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/media/evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 18:56:00,us,"
            A verdict is expected in the coming hours in the espionage case of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, with Russian prosecutors seeking an 18-year prison sentence in what his employer and the US government have dismissed as a sham trial.
    

            The court in Yekaterinburg will announce the verdict on Friday at 5 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET), the court’s press service has said.
    

            Proceedings have reached the final stage, the Sverdlovsk regional court added.
    

            Earlier Friday, the court heard closing arguments and Gershkovich delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors. The judge then retired to the deliberation room to consider the verdict.
    

            The state prosecution service has requested 18 years in prison for Gershkovich, according to state news agency TASS, citing the court. Gershkovich pleaded not guilty, TASS added.
    

            The trial resumed on Thursday after being brought forward at the request of his defense.
    

            Gershkovich was arrested while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA, making him the first American journalist to be detained on such an allegation since the Cold War.
    

            Gershkovich, the US government and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.

CNN_32,Inside the ‘doom loop’ of Joe Biden’s campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/inside-president-joe-bidens-campaign/index.html,2024-07-19 19:38:00,politics,"
            Multiple leading Democrats tell CNN they feel caught in what one described as a “doom loop,” with every move to keep President Joe Biden in or push him out further destroying their chances against Donald Trump.
    

            It’s breaking the resolve of even staunch allies. It’s feeding bad polls. It’s turning off more donors. It’s sustaining a media atmosphere where no matter what Biden does, he comes off looking like a failure.


            And for those who were hoping Biden would quit, the public and private pressure, several top Democrats worry, has been backfiring.
    

            “His last act will not be getting knocked down,” said one longtime Biden 2020 campaign aide of the family and the inner circle. “They won’t allow it.”
    

            Even several Democrats who want Biden to go acknowledge they’ve created a situation where he will never be able to satisfy the “tests” skeptics have said he must pass to stay their nominee. They are buckling down harder, especially when the critiques are more based on vibes, like when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin suggested in a session between top aides and Senate Democrats last week to “put him in a muscle shirt, like Reagan chopping wood,” according to one person briefed on the discussion.
    

            CNN’s conversations with two dozen Democratic officials, aides in the White House and the campaign reelection headquarters and supportive groups demonstrate just how dark and confused the situation has become even with Trump’s rambling and combative convention speech on Thursday night giving the Biden campaign glimmers of hope for the first time in weeks.
    

            Even among aides in the White House and Wilmington who for long after the debate were ready to stick with him, the weight has started to feel too much. They loved saying in 2020 that Joe Biden won because the party, and not the pundits. Now it feels like the party has decided again, and the president is drawing out the pain, damage to the party and embarrassment for himself with each hour.
    

            Some say they’ll quit. Some have already “quiet quit,” going through the motions until Joe Biden gets to the end that many of them now believe is inevitable.
    

            “I don’t think you can find a person who is off the record saying he should stay in,” said one person who’s been involved in several of the conversations.
    

            “There’s a growing sense that it’s game over,” said a Biden aide.
    

            Faith in the Biden inner circle – smaller and tighter than ever despite what they have been seeing on TV or hearing directly from top leaders in their own party – has been obliterated. Other senior political and government aides accuse them of delusion and catering to their own self-interest. Major donors are apoplectic.
    

            Many in the next rung of senior aides – who might otherwise be spending time building out campaign operations – have been emailing and texting to check in about how far down into despair they are day by day. They’re discussing their refusal to put their own credibility on the line to make a case for a president that they can no longer see themselves. Crucially, they don’t hear anyone making the case to them.
    

            “It feels like if he could go to Chicago and get the delegates to vote for him now, he would. It feels like if he could go to Congress and make a rousing speech, he would,” said one Democratic operative involved with the campaign. “Whatever your job is, we’re not getting the materials we need to be making the case we need to be making.”
    

            Many tend to learn of existential information involving people who work just a few feet away by reading reporters’ tweets. Trust is low. Calls from the outside are dodged. Multiple senior aides told CNN they worry about voicing the extent of their frustration or even asking questions lest they be tagged disloyal.
    

            Some tried to tap into that same righteous indignation that Biden is projecting at his own party. Biden himself is holding firm – and it’s not just him. Top aides keep telling people they remain sure of his path to win, pointing out how close the election was in 2020, how similar they still believe the electorate will behave in rejecting Trump-style extremism and how those people who are suddenly panicking about his age or the polls were not being realistic about where they were pre-debate.
    

            “Here in HQ, we’re working really hard because on winning campaigns, you work really hard,” said Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz. “There’s an immense sense of pride across our office, because we know how important and critical that work we are doing here is for the fate of our democracy.”
    

            Most leading Democrats agree that democracy is on the line, along with issues like mass deportation and ending climate protections – only intensifying the worry several Democratic officials said they had looking at the Republican convention and see not just confidence, but happiness. They think forward to their own convention in Chicago in a month and dread a week that multiple high-level Biden supporters say right now feels like will be “a funeral.”
    

            Fundraising has slowed significantly, though not as much as some have projected. Some involved believe the campaign could end the month millions short of its goal, with both grassroots online fundraising not where they expected it to be and big donors holding out, some of whom have been making a show of sending emails saying they are stopping checks to Biden and other Democrats unless he pulls out.
    

            Biden has never put much stock in donors, and that continues – especially because some of the most prominent names calling for a boycott, including Galaxy Digital LP founder Mike Novogratz and heiress Abigail Disney, had not given to Biden or the Democratic National Committee since 2020, and then only gave a total of $5,600 each. And if Biden doesn’t drop out, several senior people on the campaign believe, many of the donors now saying they won’t give will turn around if truly faced with the reality that the other option is rolling over to a Trump return.
    

            Two sources told CNN Thursday that furious donors are now telling House and Senate Democratic campaign committees they would freeze contributions unless and until party leaders took stronger steps to get Biden to step aside.
    

            “Yes, that card has been played,” a senior House Democrat told CNN Thursday night.
    

            “They believe if Joe is at the top of the ticket, the House and Senate are gone, too,” said a Democratic strategist intimately involved in big-dollar fundraising. “They don’t want to throw good money after bad.”
    

            Democratic strategists are divided about how seriously to take that threat when Trump is the alternative, almost daring the rich donors to hold back if Biden stays with it.
    

            Still, loyalist donors are swamped with emails from their counterparts, asking them to justify still backing the president. Unsure of what to say, with no guidance or talking points, some smaller groups have discussed brainstorming by shared documents on Google or group text chains. But multiple people in that smaller and smaller group are losing faith too.
    

            Morale has gotten bad enough that some are finger-pointing at each other. In the White House, they look at the campaign and say that at least they are filling their time with official duties, like pushing ahead on policy and running the federal government. In Wilmington, they look at the West Wing and say that while aides there are bemoaning their lives in blind quotes for DC insider publications, they are busy in headquarters still trying to salvage the campaign.
    

            Still, what can come off like a groundswell of calls for Biden to step aside tends to be more haphazard in reality – and with Biden perceiving them differently than those outside do.
    

            While news of his blunt conversations with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries only leaked in the last day, several people who know the president pointed out that Biden was aware of what they said last week and barreled forward still.
    

            One House Democrat who thinks Biden should not run told CNN of days of phone calls that show congressional leaders more actively engaged, citing as proof the decision to push back the virtual roll call vote for Biden’s nomination. People on the fence, the House Democrat said, “Question their position and wonder what more can be done (without doing much themselves, of course….)”
    

            Asked to describe the phone calls between members, the House Democrat said, “It’s mostly talk and posturing and the meetings you’ve heard about, from what I know.”
    

            Even as more and more campaign aides acknowledge they could be days away from switching gears to working on the Kamala Harris campaign, some continue to make the case that this entire discussion remains overblown.
    

            They point to numbers like 1,455 people signing up for a single volunteer shift in Pennsylvania on one day in the last week, or 150% more volunteers in the week after the debate than the entire month of May.
    

            “All the quantitative and qualitative things you need to win a campaign, if the question is, ‘Do we have it?’ the answer is yes. I’ve never seen such a disconnect between the numbers and the cable chatter,” said Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground state director, in an interview on Thursday.
    

            Kanninen and campaign aides acknowledge that Biden’s best path to victory is now just holding onto the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, but say they still believe that the backlash to Trump and aligned candidates for Senate and governor in Arizona and North Carolina makes those more in play than most outsiders are accounting for.
    

            They also believe that Biden’s strength with some groups, including among seniors, will give him the ability to claw back from what they argue is likely to be Trump’s high water mark post-convention — which still doesn’t have him over 50% in nearly any poll of any battleground state.
    

            “I feel strongly that based on the record, who he is, the broad coalition that he has assembled and kept makes him uniquely suited to win this election,” Kanninen said.
    

            On many minds: how small the sliver of voters were that determined power in the last two elections. Despite Biden’s 7 million vote win in the popular vote, just 44,000 votes between four states delivered him the Electoral College in 2020, and just 18,000 votes across races in 2022 were the difference between the current five-seat Republican majority and a five-seat Democratic majority in the House.
    

            To those still with Biden, that’s an argument for not creating more chaos. To those who want him out and are imagining what a dirge over the next few months could do to voter enthusiasm, that’s why he has to go. One House Democrat in a district that is not normally considered marginal described the level of worry about losing even that seat now as “DEFCON 2.”
    

            Aides insist that once they can get back to making the contrast against Trump, the polls will change, though several acknowledged that they don’t know how that will possibly happen if Biden stays in the race.
    

            “People are f**ing amped up about this election and they will vote for a dead guy over Donald Trump – that’s how scared people are,” said one top Democratic operative involved.
    

            In the meantime, Biden defenders argue that their party is full of people who are making a bad situation worse and worse.
    

            “What comes to mind is my high school baseball coach constantly reminding us we’re still in control of our own destiny. Keep your head in the game,” said California Sen. Alex Padilla. “Anybody who believes today that we’re going to lose is absolutely wrong, but the only pathway for Democrats winning in November is for all of us to do our part.”

            Former President Donald Trump accepted his third GOP nomination for president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night. His lengthy acceptance speech was his first public address since an attempt to assassinate him at a rally in Pennsylvania last week. Trump called for unity and outlined key campaign promises on the economy and the border, but repeated numerous false election claims. Elsewhere, as President Joe Biden remains in Delaware after testing positive for Covid-19, he is growing increasingly isolated from many parts of the Democratic Party. Many senior-ranking White House and campaign officials now privately believe that he must abandon his campaign for a second term — and soon.
    

            Flights around the world were grounded today after a global computer outage hit airlines and businesses. Major US carriers including Delta, United and American Airlines have been impacted, resulting in widespread delays and cancellations. The outage appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts tell CNN. The firm said the issue that caused airlines to ground flights was “not a security incident or cyberattack” and a fix has been deployed. Banks and telecom companies in Australia and New Zealand have also been affected, while Israel’s hospitals and health services are facing a computer “malfunction,” authorities said.
    

            Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that US support for Kyiv could diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. This comes as Germany’s military stocks, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. At the same time, many people in Europe are looking at Trump’s VP pick, Sen. JD Vance, with anxiety. Vance opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned that Europe will have to rely less on the US to defend the continent should the GOP regain control of the White House.
    

            Final preparations are underway for the 2024 Paris Olympics set to kick off in one week. French officials are ramping up security measures in the capital as the Olympic Village begins to welcome the first athletes into their housing facilities. On Thursday, however, a police officer was attacked and injured in central Paris, sparking alarm ahead of millions of tourist arrivals. The attack occurred in the eighth arrondissement known for iconic sites including the Champs Elysées. This is the second violent incident against French security agents this week after a soldier was stabbed on Monday in a Paris train station. French officials said they will continue to strengthen security ahead of the Games, which are expected to draw around 15 million visitors, according to the European Union.
    

            Five activists of the Just Stop Oil environmental campaign were sentenced to years in prison for blocking a major London highway in 2022. The climate justice group, which demands the UK government forge an international, legally binding treaty to end the extraction and burning of oil and coal by 2030, has staged high-profile protests in recent years — including spray painting cultural heritage sites, targeting pieces of artwork and disrupting major sporting events. The latest sentences have drawn criticism from environmental agencies and scientists, with the Just Stop Oil group describing the decision as “an obscene perversion of justice.”

CNN_34,"What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer/index.html,2024-07-19 19:41:00,us,"
            The global computer outage affecting airports, banks and other businesses on Friday appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by major US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN.
    

            CrowdStrike told customers early Friday that the outages were caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz.
    

            The company’s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike’s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud.
    

            CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software — used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including  major global banks, healthcare and energy companies — detects and blocks hacking threats. Like other cybersecurity products, the software requires deep-level access to a computer’s operating system to scan for those threats. In this case, computers running Microsoft Windows appear to be crashing because of the faulty way a software code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with the Windows system.
    

            The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack. Kurtz, in his post, said the issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem.
    

            CrowdStrike’s (CRWD) stock fell 10% in premarket trading.
    

            The massive cybersecurity company does business around the world through software sales and investigations of major hacks.
    

            The company also helps run cybersecurity investigations for the US government. For example, CrowdStrike has tracked North Korean hackers for more than a decade, the company says. It also was tasked with tracking the hacking groups that carried out the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures.
    

            But CrowdStrike is perhaps best known for investigating the Russian hack of Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 US election. It has been at the center of false conspiracy theories since 2016, most notably after a White House transcript revealed former President Donald Trump mentioned Crowdstrike in his July 2016 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to his first impeachment.
    

            CrowdStrike was the first to publicly sound the alarm about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and CrowdStrike’s assessment was later confirmed by US intelligence agencies.

CNN_35,"In Togo, these school uniforms are at the center of a movement offering girls and women a chance to build better lives",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/world/school-uniforms-africa-education-cnnheroes/index.html,2024-07-19 19:27:00,world,"
            Sometimes, a book can have a life-changing impact. For Payton McGriff, that turned out to be true.
    

            McGriff was a sophomore at the University of Idaho when she read Half the Sky, which examines the oppression of women in developing countries. She was shocked to learn that 129 million girls worldwide are not enrolled in school.
    

            “In much of the world, women and girls are responsible for the lion’s share of household duties and so a woman’s perceived value is what she can contribute to the home,” said McGriff, now 29. “It’s seen that girls won’t ever be putting (their) education to use.”
    

            Additionally, many impoverished families who want to educate their daughters can’t afford tuition fees, school supplies, and the uniform mandated in many countries.
    

            “A uniform is typically one of the more expensive pieces,” McGriff said. “They can be one of the most cost-effective ways to keep girls in school.”
    

            Studies have shown that providing free uniforms can reduce dropout rates by 16 percent and absenteeism by more than 35 percent. This simple solution took root in McGriff’s mind and started her journey helping women and girls transform their lives.
    

            Today, her nonprofit, Style Her Empowered – known as SHE – provides 1,500 girls a year in the African country of Togo with free uniforms, school fees, supplies, tutoring, and much more.
    

            A marketing major, McGriff was pursuing her dream job in business when she took an entrepreneurship class her senior year. Tasked with creating a business or nonprofit for a class project, she remembered the notion of the school uniform and developed an idea. She sought feedback from Romuald Afatchao, a professor from Togo, and he encouraged her to join a spring break trip to his hometown of Nôtse to do field research.
    

            There, McGriff saw the reality of what girls faced. She met Elolo, a young woman who started her chores at 3:30 a.m. so she could attend school and did homework by streetlight at night since her house had no electricity. Her family’s financial struggles meant she eventually had to quit school so her brothers could continue.
    

            “It made all of the stories that you read in the book so real,” McGriff said. “Talent and resilience and resourcefulness is so equally distributed worldwide, but opportunity is not.”
    

            McGriff interviewed groups of girls about obstacles that made attending school difficult. They mentioned a lack of money and support, but when she asked about uniforms, the reaction was immediate.
    

            “Every girl stood up and raised her hand so high and, not only that, told a very expressive story about how she had been shamed out of school because she didn’t have her uniform,” she said. “I realized, ‘Okay, this is a place to start.’”
    

            McGriff returned home, pitched her education project at entrepreneurship competitions, won $35,000 in seed money, and eventually turned down her dream job to bring her vision to life. She graduated in May 2017 and returned to Togo.
    

            That first year, the group hired local seamstresses and provided uniforms and school fees to 65 girls. But they soon ran into a problem.
    

            “We realized a problem that probably every parent on the planet would find obvious,” McGriff said. “Our students were outgrowing them very quickly.”
    

            Her team wanted to create an adjustable uniform that could last students longer but couldn’t find patterns that worked. Eventually, the seamstresses – with input from the students, McGriff, and others – designed their own solution, and the uniform that grows was born.
    

            The dress now has adjustable cords running along the side that create a tailored fit for every body type, while extra fabric hemmed underneath enables it to grow up to a foot in length. The uniform can fit a girl for up to three years, adjusting six sizes; when finally outgrown, it can be handed down to younger girls.
    

            What’s more, 100% of the fabric scraps are recycled into reusable menstrual pads made by SHE seamstresses and distributed to the students, who previously stayed home from school during their period because they lacked sanitary supplies.
    

            Today, SHE serves girls in Nôtse as well as 20 rural villages in southern Togo, where 69 percent of households live below the poverty line. Girls in these areas are at a higher risk to drop out of school, so SHE strives to remove all financial barriers by also providing tuition fees and school supplies. Once enrolled, students receive weekly tutoring sessions. As a result, SHE’s students consistently pass their exams at higher rates than the national average.
    

            “Our students have increased their proficiency and performance in school dramatically,” McGriff said. “If given the opportunity, they thrive.”
    

            SHE continues to develop new ways of supporting their students. The group recently created a mobile learning lab that brings books and supplies to under-resourced communities, as well as afterschool Girls Clubs where student ambassadors are trained to run workshops for their peers.
    

            “It’s all (done) with this tone of empowering girls and helping girls to understand their rights and their opportunities in society,” she said. “We see our students really start to blossom.”
    

            McGriff also brings opportunities to the women that SHE employs. Twenty seamstresses work full-time at the group’s two factories, and their average salary is 75 percent higher than Togo’s minimum wage. All employees get generous benefits, like unlimited paid sick leave, three-months paid maternity leave, and free childcare.
    

            And that’s not all. On average, women in Togo only have around three years of education – about half that of men – and 55 percent are illiterate. When McGriff realized that most of the group’s seamstresses had little formal education, she started a ‘paid to learn’ program to help teach them basic literacy, math, and financial skills.
    

            The seamstresses also travel to the villages with other staffers to help distribute uniforms and school supplies. They’re proud of their role in helping girls get opportunities they didn’t have.
    

            “Watching them flourish is really just … incredibly inspiring,” McGriff said. “When you’re part of SHE, you’re part of this movement.”
    

            McGriff supervises the project remotely from Idaho, ensuring that the local women who run the program in Togo take the lead in shaping the organization. Eventually, McGriff hopes SHE can become self-sustaining so her role can be further reduced, which has been her goal from the beginning.
    

            “The vision for starting SHE was always for it to become locally led because local women understand the challenges and the solutions far better than I ever could,” she said. “I may have struck the original match that started SHE. But what I’m so beyond inspired by is watching our team carry the torch.”
    

            One important member of that team is Elolo, who McGriff met on her first visit to Togo. Elolo was the first girl enrolled in the program, eventually graduated from high school, and is now the group’s Assistant Director and has recruited hundreds of girls to SHE. What’s more, with her salary, she’s been able to care for her family and install electricity in their home. Her success makes McGriff beam with pride.
    

            “Elolo is just the epitome of when you educate a girl, you educate a community,” she said. “She is a role model for every girl in our program who can see themselves in her.”
    

            McGriff eventually hopes to replicate SHE worldwide. Although she’s thousands of miles away from the women she works with, she feels a strong sense of connection to them.
    

            “We are so bonded by this incredible work that we get to do together,” McGriff said. “We’re watching each other explore our full potential. … It’s so girl power. It’s so fun.”

CNN_36,‘He was a pious man’: The Gaza neighborhood shocked to find Israeli hostages in their midst,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd/index.html,2024-07-19 19:11:00,world,"
            The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. They were known as pious and prominent members of the community. While people knew they had connections to Hamas, neighbors say no one could have guessed how deep those links truly went.
    

            When Israeli forces stormed the Aljamals’ building on June 8 they found Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, hostages who had been captured from the Nova music festival on October 7, cowering in a darkened room.
    

            The experience of the three men – alongside that of Noa Argamani who was held in another house nearby, belonging to the Abu Nar family – echoes testimony from previously released hostages. They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.
    

            In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.
    

            “Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.
    

            Dr. Aljamal, 74, was a general practitioner and also led the call to prayer at the local mosque, waking early every day to get there before dawn.
    

            “He was a pious man,” neighbor Abdelrahman El Tahrawi said. “He leads the prayer, then he goes back to his home. He didn’t mix with people, didn’t complain about other people, and no one complained about him. He was a man who minded his own business.”
    

            Dr. Aljamal’s son Abdallah, 36, was a freelance journalist who most recently wrote for the US-based Palestine Chronicle, for which he filed regular dispatches on the war in Gaza.
    

            Neighbors told CNN it was no secret that the family had links to Hamas. “We were worried about the Aljamal house. They are with Hamas,” said a neighbor and family acquaintance.
    

            Abdallah had served as a spokesman for Gaza’s Ministry of Labor as recently as 2022, a position entrusted only to Hamas members, according to political analysts. He also showed his support for the group on social media. On Facebook, he posted pictures of his young son dressed in the fatigues of Hamas’ armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, and on October 7 openly praised the group’s attack on Israel. In a 2022 video post, Abdallah commended the Hamas operation to kidnap Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza between 2006 and 2011, and proclaimed: “Brothers, all of us are prepared to die for the resistance.”
    

            Public support for Hamas as a political movement in Gaza has ranged from 34 to “Hamas only trusts Hamas when it comes to those very sensitive issues such as Israeli hostages,” he said.42% over the past seven months, according to polls by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people’s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. The true level of support for Hamas may be lower, according to Dr. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.
    

            There may be other reasons why Hamas chose to house hostages in civilian homes, however.
    

            Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said that approach fits Hamas’ strategy to get Israel “bogged down in the urban centers of Gaza and push them into a counterinsurgency that cannot end, which is the perpetual war Hamas says it wants.”
    

            A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.
    

            Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. At least 1,200 people were killed and some 250 people in total were taken from Israel into the strip, according to Israeli authorities.
    

            A senior Hamas official last month told CNN the group does not know how many hostages are still alive, suggesting it may not have full oversight of their whereabouts. Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz told an Israeli TV channel that Israel knows to a “very close number” how many hostages remain alive.
    

            Despite the level of support in Gaza for Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007, far fewer people would be accepted into the trusted inner circles of the Islamist movement.
    

            Hostages being held by civilians under the direction of Hamas is unlikely unless they have very strong ties to and are well trusted by the group, according to Abusada.
    

            The three hostages who were held in the Aljamal family building were kept there for around six months, according to Andrey Kozlov, who spoke last week to CNN.
    

            Kozlov described physical and psychological abuse he received at the hands of his guards. One in particular, he said, “was a big fan of creative punishment” who on one occasion forced him to spend two days on a mattress without moving or talking as a penalty for standing near an open window, and on another occasion covered him with blankets in the summer heat for washing his hands with drinking water.

            “I was trying to breathe through the space between the mattress and blankets,” he said.
    

            During that time the hostages could hear the family, including children, going about their daily lives on the floor below, according to Aviram Meir, the uncle of Almog Meir Jan. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.
    

            Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.
    

            Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. The Israeli soldiers entered and shot Abdallah’s wife Fatima first, before killing Ahmed and Abdallah, she wrote. Zainab hid with Abdallah’s children under a bed, according to the now-deleted Facebook post which was shared with CNN by independent open-source researcher Thomas Bordeaux.
    

﻿Zainab said in the post that the family had been waiting for the moment they would be killed by Israeli forces. “Since the start of the war, we have been waiting for this moment. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”
    

            As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.
    

            Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

            Less is known about Argamani’s captors. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.
    

            In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.
    

            The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.
    

            According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.
    

            CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.
    

            Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.
    

            Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.
    

            “They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.
    

            Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.
    

            “He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”
    

            Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.
    

            “They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”
    

            After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.
    

            More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured. Israel puts the number of deaths at under 100. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures.
    

            Many locals questioned why so many Palestinians had to die for the Israeli forces to rescue just four hostages.
    

            Al-Kahlot said: “People died because they were freeing her, and no one was looking at us.”

CNN_37,Lewis Hamilton praises Ralf Schumacher after former F1 driver publicly identifies as gay,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/lewis-hamilton-praises-ralf-schumacher-f1-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 19:20:00,world,"
            Seven-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has praised Ralf Schumacher after the former F1 driver revealed on Monday that he was in a same-sex relationship.
    

            Schumacher, the younger brother of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, posted a picture with his partner on Instagram, who was later named as Etienne by German actress Carmen Geiss, a close friend of Schumacher’s.
    

            “The most beautiful thing in life is when you have the right partner by your side with whom you can share everything,” Schumacher wrote on Instagram.
    

            He was previously married to Cora Schumacher and is the father to a son, David.
    

            The 49-year-old had an 11-year F1 career, driving for Jordan, Williams and Toyota and won six races along the way. He is only the second Formula One driver to identify as gay, with Hamilton saying that Schumacher’s announcement sends a “positive message.”
    

            “I think clearly he’s not felt comfortable being able to say it in the past and it’s definitely not a new thing, but I think it just shows that we are in a time that finally you can take that step and don’t have to fear,” Hamilton said ahead of this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, via Sky Sports.
    

            “Even him taking that step sends such a positive message and liberates others to be able to do the same. We need more and more people to do that.”
    

            Hamilton has long been a defender of LGBTQ rights and has received praise for donning a helmet featuring the Pride flag at several races, including at the Qatar and Saudi Arabia Grands Prix.
    

            The Mercedes driver spoke about the need for F1 to “do more” in order to make the sport more inclusive following Schumacher’s announcement.
    

            “Within sports, I think it still has a long way to go,” said the 39-year-old. “There is one thing saying that it’s inclusive and there’s another thing actually making sure that people actually feel comfortable in the environments.
    

            “This is a male-dominated space and, as far as I know, he’s one of the first to at least publicly be speaking in that respect. We are very inclusive within our team, but I think the sport does need to continue to do more to probably make people feel more comfortable, make women feel more welcome in this space because I know they’ve not always been treated well in this space.”

CNN_38,WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich convicted of espionage by Russian court in case denounced by US as a sham,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/media/evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 20:44:00,us,"
Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham.
    

            The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).
    

            The court heard closing arguments and Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter,  delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning.
    

            The case’s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters.
    

            Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA. Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence publicly to support their claims.
    

            Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.
    

            In a statement on Thursday, his employer said he had been unjustly arrested. “Evan’s wrongful detention has been an outrage since his unjust arrest 477 days ago, and it must end now,” WSJ publisher Dow Jones said.
    

            “Even as Russia orchestrates its shameful sham trial, we continue to do everything we can to push for Evan’s immediate release and to state unequivocally: Evan was doing his job as a journalist, and journalism is not a crime. Bring him home now.”

Putin’s summer residence gets new air defenses as Ukraine steps up drone attacks


            Following his arrest, he was held in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day.
    

            Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.
    

            US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges.
    

A high-profile swap in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia refused to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization in return.
    

            In an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested “an agreement can be reached” with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019.
    

            The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington.
    

            In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that “under instructions from the CIA” and “using painstaking conspiratorial methods,” Gershkovich “was collecting secret information” about a Russian tank factory.

CNN_40,Fallout intensifies over soccer star Enzo Fernández and Argentina teammates singing racist chant about France,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/fallout-enzo-fernandez-argentina-racist-chant-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 20:29:00,world,"
            The fallout from Enzo Fernández and the Argentina national team’s racist chant has intensified as Argentina’s undersecretary of sport was sacked, while former France captain Hugo Lloris called it “an attack about French people.”
    

            Earlier this week, Fernández apologized for the video, which was posted on Instagram from the team bus after winning the Copa América, saying it does not “reflect my beliefs or my character.” His club Chelsea has launched an internal disciplinary investigation and the French Football Federation has filed a legal complaint.
    

            Julio Garro, Argentina’s undersecretary of sport, said on Argentine radio that national team captain Lionel Messi and Argentinian Football Association (AFA) president Claudio Tapia should apologize.
    

            That prompted the country’s president, Javier Milei, to sack Garro.
    

            “The Office of the President reports that no government can tell the Argentine National Team, world champion and two-time American champion, what to comment, what to think or what to do to or to any other citizen,” Milei wrote on X on Thursday.
    

            “For this reason, Julio Garro ceases to be undersecretary of sports of the nation.”
    

            However, Garro later “categorically denied” asking Messi to apologize.
    

            “It would be a lack of respect for those who permanently honor us with their human and sporting quality,” he wrote on X.
    

            Neither Messi or Tapia have publicly commented on the incident.
    

            In a separate post, Garro went on to thank Milei for letting him be part of his team.
    

            “I am very sorry if my comment offended anyone, that was never my intention, and that is why I made my resignation available, although I will always be on the other side of discrimination in all its forms,” he wrote.
    

            The country’s vice-president, Victoria Villarruel, also slammed Fernández’s critics.
    

            “No colonialist country is going to intimidate us for a song that is sung on the pitch or for telling the truths that they do not want to admit,” she wrote on X. “Stop feigning indignation, hypocrites. Enzo, I support you, Messi, thank you for everything! Argentines always with their heads held high! Long live Argentina!”
    

            But Lloris, who was France’s goalkeeper and captain in the 2022 World Cup final against Argentina, was scathing of Fernández and the Argentine national team.
    

            In his apology, Fernández said he was “caught up in the euphoria,” but Lloris insisted this was no excuse.
    

            “It doesn’t matter if you are in a moment of euphoria because you have won an important trophy,” he told the BBC. “It demands even more responsibility when you are a winner. You don’t want to hear or see this kind of thing in football. We all stand against discrimination and racism.
    

            “I just think and hope it is a mistake. We all make mistakes sometimes and hopefully they will learn from it. They [Argentina] are the face of football right now, in South America, in the world. They deserve a lot of credit for what they have done on the field for the last four or five years.
    

            “But when you win, you are an example for others, especially kids. It was a proper attack about the French people, especially for the French people who have some African origin and family.”
    

            Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba posted a quote from French outlet Liberation on his X account, writing: “‘Argentina, land of aslyum for former Nazis on the run. Since 1945, Peron has welcomed war criminals’ – Liberation.”
    

            He added: “And this surprises you…”

CNN_41,‘I didn’t do a whole lot of things right’: Tiger Woods in danger of missing the cut after toiling Open start,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/tiger-woods-open-championship-cut-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 20:01:00,world,"
Tiger Woods faces an uphill battle to make the weekend at the Open Championship after toiling to an eight-over 79 during the first round of the major in Scotland on Thursday.
    

            The 48-year-old made a bright start amid wet and windy conditions at Royal Troon, parring twice before producing one of the shots of the day with a brilliant curling birdie putt from just off the green on the third hole.
    

            Yet except for another birdie at the 13th, it was mostly misery for the 15-time major champion, as six bogeys and two double bogeys wrecked his early momentum.

Open Championship: Rory McIlroy loses ball to train tracks as he and Bryson DeChambeau are derailed by grueling starts


            Woods’ first double came at the par-three fifth after he got into bunker trouble, the second arriving at the 11th “Railway” hole after the American sent his tee drive skewing towards the train tracks running along the right side of the fairway – just as Rory McIlroy had done earlier.
    

            It resigned the three-time Open winner to just his sixth career major round in which he has shot eight over or worse, according to ESPN.
    

            With only the top-70 and ties after Friday’s second round securing passage to the weekend, Woods will require a huge turnaround if he is to avoid missing a third consecutive major cut for the second time in his career.
    

            “I didn’t do a whole lot of things right today,” he told reporters Thursday.
    

            “I didn’t hit my irons very close, and I didn’t give myself a whole lot of looks today. I need to shoot something in the mid-60s tomorrow to get something going on the weekend.”
    

            Woods, who fell short of three consecutive major weekends in 2015, had arrived at Royal Troon adamant that he will play as long as he feels he can still win, shunning former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie’s suggestion he should consider retiring.
    

            This year marks the first since his 2021 car crash that Woods has competed at all four majors. In February, he had expressed his desire to compete in one tournament a month but – despite “physically feeling a lot better” than at the beginning of the year – has only competed in five official events in 2024.
    

            “I just wish I could have played a little bit more, but I’ve been saving it for the majors just in case I do something pretty major and then take myself out of it,” Woods added Thursday.
    

            “I thought I could play a little bit more earlier in the year. I think I was a little bit too optimistic. I need to do a lot more work in the gym and keep progressing like we have.”
    

            Playing partner and May’s PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who shot an opening two-under 69, said he could empathize with Woods’ fight for sharpness.
    

            “He’s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he’s hard on himself too,” world No. 3 Schauffele told reporters after his round.
    

            “He’s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can’t do. I’m sure he’d like to prep more at home if his body would allow it … I know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level. If your body is not letting you do it, it’s just frustrating.”
    

            Schauffele ended Thursday four shots behind Daniel Brown as the Englishman carded a bogey-free 65 to surge into an early lead following his first ever round of major golf.
    

            A closing birdie edged the world No. 272 one stroke ahead of Ireland’s Shane Lowry, who is chasing his second Claret Jug after victory in 2019.

CNN_42,Student loan payments will be paused for 8 million borrowers after appeals court temporarily halts Biden’s repayment plan,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/student-loan-save-plan-payments-paused/index.html,2024-07-19 21:57:00,politics,"
            The Department of Education will pause student loan payments for 8 million borrowers after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked a repayment plan that the Biden administration launched last year.
    

            The fate of the plan, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), is in flux as courts across the country consider two legal challenges brought by several Republican-led states.
    

            “Borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance while our administration continues to vigorously defend the SAVE Plan in court,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement.
    

            Payments are not required during a forbearance, but a borrower is not making any progress toward paying down their debt.
    

            “The department will be providing regular updates to borrowers affected by these rulings in the coming days,” Cardona said.
    

            Reducing student loan debt has been a priority for the Biden administration and the SAVE plan is one of the most significant policy changes it has made.
    

            Like other existing student loan repayment plans, SAVE ties a borrower’s monthly payments to their income and family size. But SAVE is the most generous plan for low-income borrowers, offering lower payments and a faster path to student loan forgiveness. More than half of the 8 million people currently enrolled in SAVE have $0 monthly payments.
    

            The SAVE plan opened last year, after the Supreme Court struck down Biden’s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program before it took effect.
    

            Two groups of GOP-led states filed lawsuits earlier this year, arguing that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to implement SAVE. The government’s lawyers say they are relying on power provided by Congress to the executive branch by a law called the Higher Education Act.
    

            On Thursday, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals halted SAVE in a one-sentence, unsigned order. The court said the new freeze would remain in effect until it decides whether to issue a longer-term block.
    

            Meanwhile, in a separate case, Alaska, South Carolina and Texas have asked the Supreme Court to review the SAVE plan.


            Much of the SAVE plan was implemented last year. But further reductions to borrowers’ payments were scheduled to take effect in July. The Biden administration said that some, but not all, of those reductions were made to date. Now, all borrowers will be put in a forbearance.
    

            Lawyers for the Biden administration told the high court on Wednesday that it should let the program move forward while the legal matters play out. They argue that “borrowers would stand to suffer significant and irreparable harm” and many would “experience intense confusion” about the status of their loans if the court blocked the administration from lowering their monthly payments as planned.
    

            In the legal challenge led by Kansas, the complaint argued that the SAVE plan “transforms many or most loans into outright grants from the federal government — without any appropriation from Congress.”
    

            Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness.
    

            The estimated cost of the SAVE plan varies, ranging from the Biden administration’s estimate of $138 billion over 10 years to $475 billion over the same period, according to an estimate from researchers at the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In comparison, Biden’s one-time, signature student loan forgiveness program was expected to cost about $400 billion before it was struck down by the Supreme Court.

CNN_43,Kamala Harris turns her attention to JD Vance amid speculation about Biden’s future,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/kamala-harris-jd-vance-race/index.html,2024-07-19 21:54:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris has spent much of the year traveling around the country, tackling the Republican party and its leader, former President Donald Trump. But now she’s throwing her political punches at another opponent: Sen. JD Vance.


            Mounting concerns over President Joe Biden and his viability as a candidate have put an even brighter spotlight on Harris in recent weeks, as some allies and lawmakers float her name as a possible replacement to lead the party’s ticket. As panic and speculation spread across the Democratic Party following the June 27 debate, the vice president and her aides continued to keep an eye on who might be selected to serve as Trump’s vice president.
    

            In the weeks leading up to Trump unveiling his running mate in Milwaukee, there were several men widely believed to be on the former president’s short list.
    

            They monitored with great interest each of their Sunday show appearances, public remarks and other media interviews, with the expectation that one of them would likely face off against Harris on the debate stage this summer.
    

            Harris’ team agreed: Vance would clearly be a tough debate opponent. The Ohioan appeared particularly skilled at deflecting questions about Trump’s past statements and policy positions. That ability is likely to be one of several key factors that will shape Harris’ debate preparations.
    

            Democrats hope that Harris – who debated Biden during the 2020 Democratic primary and landed some of the most memorable punches on the now-president – will far outperform Vance. Biden’s disastrous showing against Trump last month has set off panic across the Democratic Party, and the president’s allies are scrambling to try to turn the page on the saga.
    

            Biden’s halting debate showing stunned even some of his own top aides, and the president botching an opportunity to lay out a clear argument against Trump on the issue of reproductive rights was among the most puzzling and frustrating for Democrats tuning in.
    

            “She will keep him and Trump on defense on abortion in a way that ideally Biden would’ve done in the debate,” one longtime Harris friend said.
    

            Aides to Harris say that when it comes to two issues in particular – reproductive rights and Trump’s threat to democracy – Vance’s own record and past statements should only strengthen what they already see as the vice president’s most compelling arguments against the former president.
    

            In preparing for Trump’s vice-presidential pick, Harris aides saw an opportunity in Vance, given his support of a federal ban on abortion. Harris has already been crisscrossing the country, attacking restrictions on abortions, and casting them as “Trump abortion bans.”
    

            When asked if that would factor into how Harris makes her case against the Trump-Vance ticket, one source said: “Of course it will be. His record speaks for itself,” referring to Vance.
    

            But, sources say, that Harris’ main target on the trail will continue to be Trump, while Vance serves as an example of what the former president wants to achieve in a second term.
    

            “On the campaign trail, she’ll keep the focus on Trump and talk about Vance as how it reflects on Trump,” a campaign source told CNN. “This is telling about Trump’s true position on an abortion ban. You can expect her to make that case,” the source added, referring to Trump’s waffling on an abortion ban.
    

            Harris previewed that message during a campaign stop in North Carolina on Thursday.
    

            The vice president argued that Trump’s VP pick is a distraction from his extreme agenda that Americans “are not falling for.”
    

            “With the selection of his running mate this week, Donald Trump is also trying to distract people. He wants to direct attention away from his record and his project 2025 plan to suggest that he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class,” Harris said.
    

            In a brief call Tuesday, Harris and Vance said they looked forward to debating one another but didn’t discuss specifics about when that would happen, according to two sources familiar with the call. The Trump campaign has declined to commit to a date, as they point to the chaos unfolding in the other political party.
    

            “We don’t know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention. To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate,” Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement to CNN.
    

            The Biden campaign hit back Wednesday, saying: “This debate has been discussed for two months now. If JD Vance is unwilling to defend the Trump-Vance record on the debate stage, he should just say so.”

CNN_44,What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html,2024-07-19 21:48:00,world,"
            Computer glitches. Air traffic controller shortages. Bad weather. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled.
    

            It’s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time – or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not).
    

            In the midst of a record-setting summer for air travel, here’s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled.
    

            As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it’s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room.
    

            “Check your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,” said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. “Save yourself the drive to the airport.” 
    

            Keyes told CNN Travel that you should sign up for airlines’ free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier’s app.
    

            You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That’s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up.
    

            Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country.
    

            Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee.
    

            When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Keyes, The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights).
    

            Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you’ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do?
    

            Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents’ desk – and get ready to multitask while you’re in line.
    

            Fast is a key word here. “It’s going to make a difference who arrives first. It’s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,” Keyes said.
    

            Then you might want to call up your carrier while you’re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. “Whatever happens first, great,” he said.
    

            Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead.
    

            “Most US-based travelers aren’t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.”
    

            You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. “Scan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.”
    

            The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage.
    

            “Not all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn’t always easy,” it told CNN Travel in an email.
    

            “Airlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter [now X] are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it’s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.”
    

            Whether you’re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude.
    

            “Honey attracts more flies than vinegar,” Keyes said. “Look at this from the airline agents’ perspective. They’ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you.
    

            “Asking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.”
    

            He had another tip when it’s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: “Come prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.”
    

            Your agent can expedite things if you’ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you’ve been waiting. 
    

            If you’ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you’ll have to deal through them when there’s a cancellation.

            If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, “it makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies” when you booked via a third party.
    

US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong.
    

            The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily. 
    

            Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor.
    

            “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel. 
    

            “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”
    

            “If you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,” Smith said. “As we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.”
    

            What do you do if it looks like you’re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you’re not in your home city?
    

            “Ask the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It’s not required by law,” Keyes said. 
    

            They’re less likely to do it if it’s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues.
    

            Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.

            Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
    

            Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren’t likely to just be offered.
    

            Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation.
    

            “The good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.” Smith said. “These travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.”
    

            If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport.
    

            The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily.
    

            Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it’s always better to arrive late than not at all.
    

            Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel.
    

            It said “most travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.” 
    

            The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later. 
    

            But keep it to the basics. “Airlines only pay for ‘reasonable’ expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. “
    

            The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or “significant delay” or “significant change” to your flight and you choose not to travel.
    

            This is the policy for cancellations regardless of the reason the airline cancels. In cases of “significant” delays or changes to itineraries, what constitutes “significant” remains open to interpretation and depends on a number of factors.
    

New federal rules say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline – not vouchers or travel credits.
    

            “From now on when your flight is canceled for any reason, you are entitled to an automatic cash refund and it has to be prompt,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN when the new rule was announced in April.
    

            Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel before the new rules came into effect that flyers should try to avoid vouchers.
    

            “If travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,” Pawliszyn said. “Of course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.”

CNN_45,"Allen Weisselberg, former Trump Org. CFO, released from jail after serving 100 days for lying during investigation",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/allen-weisselberg-released/index.html,2024-07-19 22:15:00,politics,"
            Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was released from jail after serving 100 days for lying during an investigation into Donald Trump’s real estate business.
    

            Weisselberg, the former right-hand man to Trump, was released Friday, according to New York City’s Department of Corrections website and confirmed by a person familiar with the matter.
    

            He pleaded guilty earlier this year to two counts of perjury for lying during the New York attorney general’s investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances. As part of a plea deal with the Manhattan district attorney’s office he received a sentence of five months, but with time off for good behavior he served 100 days at New York City’s Rikers Island jail.
    

            It was the second guilty plea for Trump’s long time money man, who never turned against the former president despite pressure from numerous criminal investigations.
    

            Weisselberg previously served 100 days after he pleaded guilty to engaging in a decade-long tax fraud scheme. He left the Trump Organization under a severance agreement after his first guilty plea. As part of the agreement he could not speak negatively about the company.

CNN_46,Starbucks wanted to be the ‘third place.’ Now it’s speeding you out the door,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/starbucks-mobile-orders-third-place/index.html,2024-07-19 22:27:00,us,"
            Years ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it’s a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you’re lucky to find anyone sitting down.
    

            Under Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a “third place” between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect.
    

            “If you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,” Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. “There’s nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.”
    

            The idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas, handwrote customers’ names on their drink orders.
    

            By the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer’s propose to his spouse, writing “will you marry me?” on a cup.
    

            “It was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,” she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. “It’s why so many employees stayed for so long.”
    

            Eisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores.
    

            But Starbucks’ business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way.
    

            Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks’ sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers’ names have replaced baristas’ handwriting on cups.
    

            “Third place is a broader definition,” current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The “classic definition of third place — it’s a box where I go to meet someone — it’s frankly not relevant anymore in this context.”
    

            Starbucks’ sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks’ CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks’ board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company’s issues.
    

            “U.S. operations are the primary reason for the company’s fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,” he said. The company needs to “focus on being experiential, not transactional.”
    

            Starbucks’ changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends — demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating.
    

            Starbucks shifted to meet Wall Street’s demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America’s third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns.


            But by prioritizing speed — “throughput” in corporate parlance — Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say.
    

            “Their success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,” said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. “It’s turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.”
    

            Many Starbucks’ stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. “They had this unique image and personality. That doesn’t exist anymore.”
    

            Starbucks’ shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual.
    

            The company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal.
    

            “We don’t want to become just another commodity product,” Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. “The drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It’s not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.”
    

            But Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks’ roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option.
    

            Mobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks’ road to becoming primarily a take-away business.
    

            In 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks’ loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers.
    

            Mobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus’ spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year.
    

            Although mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say.
    

            Starbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat.
    

            Mobile ordering “commoditized” Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks’ struggles in Harvard Business Review.
    

            Starbucks’ menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say.
    

            Starbucks says that it’s evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling.
    

            In 2022, Starbucks said it was “reimagining the third place” by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks’ mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks.
    

            Starbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations.
    

            Eisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down.
    

            The best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said.
    

            That means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders.
    

            “If the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,” she said. “That allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.”

CNN_47,WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich sentenced to 16 years for espionage by Russian court in case denounced by US as a sham,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/media/evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 22:23:00,us,"
Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham.
    

            The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET).
    

            The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning.
    

            The case’s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters.
    

            The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement.
    

            In June, Moscow confirmed again that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov repeatedly insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in “absolute silence” to prevent complications.
    

            Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA. Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims.
    

            Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.

            In a statement following Friday’s sentencing, Gershkovich’s employer said: “This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist.
    

            “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family,” the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued.
    

            “Journalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he’s released. This must end now,” it added.
    

            The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict. The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed.
    

            According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence.
    

            Following his arrest, Gershkovich was held in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell, before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day.
    

            Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him.
    

            US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges.
    

A high-profile swap in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia refused to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia’s domestic spy organization in return.
    

            In an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested “an agreement can be reached” with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019.
    

            The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington.
    

            In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that “under instructions from the CIA” and “using painstaking conspiratorial methods,” Gershkovich “was collecting secret information” about a Russian tank factory.

            Hundreds of US flights were grounded Friday morning due to a technical disaster impacting businesses worldwide – leading to cancellations, delays and confusion at airports across the country.
    

            A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, businesses and even emergency services around the world.
    

            As of Friday morning, more than 1,400 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport told passengers to not even come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events.

            “So tomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon. And then on Sunday, I have my sister’s 50th birthday party,” said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Friday. “It’s really chaotic. It’s frustrating. And I’ve never experienced anything like this before at this airport.”

            “The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the Federal Aviation Administration posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”
    

            Kurtz later told NBC, “We’re resolving and have resolved the issue.” 


            “As systems come back online, as they’re rebooted, they’re coming up and they’re working,” Kurtz said on the “Today” show Friday morning. However, Kurtz said, it could be “some time” for certain systems that won’t just automatically recover.

Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.
    

            – American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations Friday. “Earlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,” American said in a statement to CNN. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”

CNN_49,"Journalist told to pay Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni $5,400 for Tweet mocking her height",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/europe/italian-journalist-giorgia-meloni-tweet-mocking-height-intl-scli/index.html,2024-07-19 22:10:00,world,"
            A Milan court has ordered a journalist to pay Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni damages of €5,000 (around $5,400) for making fun of her in a social media post, news agency ANSA and other local media reported.
    

            The journalist, Giulia Cortese, was also given a suspended fine of €1,200 ($1,300) for a jibe on Twitter, now named X, in October 2021 about Meloni’s height, which was defined as “body shaming”.
    

            In a response to a Reuters story on the verdict, Cortese wrote on X on Thursday: “Italy’s government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent.”

            Meloni had launched legal action against the journalist after the two women clashed on social media three years ago.
    

            Meloni, whose far-right Brothers of Italy party was in opposition at the time, took exception when Cortese published a mocked-up photo of her with a picture of the late fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the background.
    

            Cortese responded with further tweets including one that translates as “you don’t scare me, Giorgia Meloni. After all, you’re only 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. I can’t even see you.”
    

            Meloni’s height is given as between 1.58 meters (5 feet 2 inches) and 1.63 meters (5 feet 4 inches) on various media websites.
    

            Cortese can appeal against the sentence, and Meloni’s lawyer said the prime minister would donate to charity any damages she eventually receives.
    

            Writing in English on X on Thursday, Cortese said it was a tough time for independent journalists in Italy.
    

            “Let’s hope for better days ahead. We won’t give up!” she added.
    

            A high number of lawsuits brought against journalists was cited this year by Reporters Without Borders, which relegated Italy five places to 46th in its 2024 World Press Freedom Index.
    

            Meloni is not new to taking journalists to court. Last year, a Rome court fined best-selling author Roberto Saviano €1,000 ($1,088) plus legal expenses after he insulted her on television in 2021 over her hardline stance on illegal immigration.

            While tourists in Barcelona risk being squirted with water pistols, those in the town of Calpe on Spain’s Mediterranean coast face another threat: a hefty fine for reserving space on the beach for themselves.
    

            The town council reminded beachgoers in a news release Wednesday that under the Municipal Ordinance of Use and Management of the Coast, they are prohibited from installing items such as chairs, hammocks and beach umbrellas before 9 a.m. in order not to hinder the clean-up of the beaches.
    

            Those who do not comply with this rule face being reported, their belongings being removed and fines of €250 euros (around $270).

            Chairs, hammocks and umbrellas that are left unattended for more than three hours during the day may be removed, the council said.
    

            It added that it has received complaints for some years now about people reserving space on the beach, with visitors arriving mid-morning to find it already staked out with belongings but no sign of their owners.
    

            The issue of space-hogging beachgoers is also a daily problem in nearby holiday hotspot Benidorm, according to local news site Información.
    

            Over the past few months, there has been increasing pushback against holidaymakers in Spain and its islands.
    

            Last month, the government of Barcelona – where thousands have been protesting against mass tourism – announced that it will bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028, as it seeks to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents.
    

            In May, there were further crackdowns on party boats and public drinking on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca.
    

            And in April, locals in the Canary Islands protested against excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage.

            Many flights across the world have been delayed or grounded due to a major IT system failure.
    

            All flights for US airlines United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines were grounded early on Friday, with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), citing communication issues.
    

            American Airlines has since confirmed that is has resolved the issue affecting its operations, while Delta and United have resumed some flights.
    

            “The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” reads a statement from the FAA posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            As of 10 a.m. ET, there were about 2,400 canceled flights globally and about 25,000 delays, according to flight tracking website FlightAware, with chaotic scenes at airports across the world as passengers wait for updates.
    

            Here are some of the major airlines and airports that have been impacted by the tech outage:

CNN_52,Global tech outage: What to know if you’re traveling this weekend,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend/index.html,2024-07-19 22:04:00,world,"
            Unexpected tech outages are currently impacting airlines and airports across the world. Here’s what to know if you’re planning to travel this weekend.
    

            Widespread IT problems are currently impacting global travel. It’s believed the issue stems, at least in part, from a software update issued by software company CrowdStrike on Microsoft Windows operating systems.
    

            The CEO of CrowdStrike said in a statement obtained by CNN that the IT issue causing a global outage has been identified and a fix has been deployed.
    

            Meanwhile, Microsoft said the “underlying cause” that led to the global outage “has been fixed,” but added that residual impact is still affecting some services.
    

            Airports, airlines and travelers across the globe continue to navigate the fall-out.
    

            US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday. American Airlines has since said it has “safely reestablished” operations, while United Airlines is resuming “some flights.”
    

            Delta Air Lines operations resumed some flight departures but additional delays and cancellations are expected Friday.


            The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement that it’s “closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” adding that “several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            Ryanair, Air France and Turkish Airlines also reported issues, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said the outages are “making flight handling impossible.” AirAsia said its “core reservation and check-in system” have been impacted by the tech issues.


            Cirium, an aviation analytics company, shared preliminary data with CNN on Friday about the extent of the disruption. Across the globe, there are around 110,000 scheduled commercial flights Friday, according to Cirium. As of 6 a.m. ET, Cirium said there were 1,390 canceled flights globally and that figure was growing.
    

            This is a fast-moving situation, so if you’re planning on flying this weekend, it’s best to keep tabs on your chosen airline’s social media channels, apps and website for up-to-date information. Check your flight status before you head to the airport, if you can.

            Travel will likely take a while to get back on track, even once the outage is sorted. The stoppage of flights means that thousands of aircraft have been grounded around the world and could be stuck in the wrong airports.
    

            Crews have limits on their working hours, so staffing challenges cascade along with flight delays.
    

            Getting schedules back on track is a complicated process that can take several days to iron out. The best course of action is to monitor your airline for announcements and to know your rights as a consumer.
    

            Many airports across the globe are logging tech-related issues. Dubai Airport reported issues on Friday morning, but the airport said in a post on X that normal operations have resumed.
    

            Passenger William Sikora III told CNN Friday morning that the situation at Philadelphia International Airport is “absolutely insane right now” in the wake of the disruption.
    

In Europe, London’s Gatwick Airport said it is “affected by the global Microsoft issues” and that passengers may experience delays checking in and going through security. London’s Heathrow Airport said it was working with “airport colleagues to minimize the impact” and advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest flight information. Berlin Airport said it is experiencing delays to check-in, while Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport stated the impact on its airport is “being mapped.”
    

            Scotland’s Edinburgh Airport said the outages mean “wait times are longer than usual at the airport.” Spain’s airport authority, AENA, which supervises airports in Madrid, Barcelona and others across the country, said the tech issues “could cause delays” and that its staff are working to solve the problems.
    

            This is not an exhaustive list, so it’s best to check the status of any airports you’ll be transiting through this weekend before you travel.
    

            First off, if you can, check the status of your flight before you leave for the airport. It’s better to find out your flight is canceled from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there, if at all possible.
    

            If you’re already at the airport, head to the airline help desk. While you’re standing in line, it’s worth phoning the airline help number and trying to contact the company via social media or email. If you are a member of an airline executive club and have access to a special phone number, now is the time to use it.
    

            If it looks like the airline won’t be able to put you on a flight until the following day, ask for a hotel room or hotel voucher. There are fewer consumer protections for situations outside of airlines’ control, but it’s worth requesting. And if your airline seems to be impacted, but another airline is still operable – ask about flying with other carriers.
    

            “When flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier’s flight because they have interline agreements,” Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel in our guide to flight cancellations, which you can read here.
    

            “This means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.”
    

            If you can plausibly take a train rather than fly – e.g. if you’re in the UK heading to mainland Europe – it could be worth checking last-minute ticket availability.

What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed


            That depends on where you’re flying to and from – in the US, for example, passengers have the right to a refund for canceled flights, but additional compensation or accommodation for delays or cancellations outside of carriers’ control is up to each airline.
    

            On flights to and from EU countries, the laws are different. If your airport of origin is within the EU or if you’re arriving to the EU on an EU airline, you’re entitled to a refund for delays longer than five hours and additional compensation for some shorter delays.
    

            Wherever you’re traveling, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with the airline terms and conditions associated with your booking.
    

            And if you have travel insurance, look up your rights there too.
    

            That all depends on the type of ticket you have, the airline you’re flying with and whether you have travel insurance (which is always a good idea). Insurance covers missed departures and connections – if your flight is delayed, your company may be able to help change your travel plans, though it’s unlikely that they’ll refund you if your flight is not affected but you no longer want to travel.
    

            Check your airline to see if it’s offering passengers the chance to cancel or change dates. As the situation spirals and airlines reroute passengers on canceled flights, the flexibility may increase. At the time of writing, American Airlines is offering free changes for those due to fly on July 19 through eight major hubs (there are caveats as to rebooking dates).
    

            British Airways said it has increased flexibility for customers flying shorthaul routes over the weekend.
    

            Delta has issued a travel waiver for impacted customers
    

            Some train systems are reporting issues related to the tech outage. In the UK, National Rail reported “widespread IT issues across the entire network” on Friday. National Rail said UK train operators are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, so there’s the potential for short-notice train cancellations.
    

            In Italy, the transport ministry said Trenitalia and Italo train networks were suspended after systems went offline. Passengers called emergency services and demanded to be let off the trains because of extreme heat, after enduring delays up to 140 minutes. Some trains on rural Italian rail lines have been stopped due to extreme heat.
    

            In the US, trains and buses in Washington, D.C. have been impacted by Friday’s outages, according to the US capital’s transit authority. A number of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) systems are “currently down,” with a post on X stating: “Our IT teams are working to address this issue.”
    

            In New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) customer information systems went temporarily offline Friday morning, according to officials. However the MTA said “train and bus service is unaffected.”
    

            Again, this isn’t an exhaustive list. If you’re set to travel soon, wherever you are in the world, it’s worth double checking your individual journey status before you travel.

CNN_53,Family of another American journalist held in Russia calls on Biden administration to do more to help,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/american-journalist-alsu-kurmasheva-held-russia/index.html,2024-07-19 23:32:00,politics,"
            When Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was blocked from leaving Russia last June, her family never expected that she would still be in Russian detention more than a year later.
    

            “We were so confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets … in June or July … for August 2024,” her husband, Pavel Butorin, told CNN. “Little did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.”
    

            Kurmasheva, a longtime journalist for US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), had gone back to Russia to see her mother in May 2023. According to Butorin, when she attempted to leave Russia and return home to Prague in early June, she was briefly detained at the airport and her passports were taken. She was fined and placed under de facto — and then formal — house arrest for months.
    

            Then, in October 2023, while awaiting the return of her passports, Kurmasheva was arrested and charged by the Russian authorities, who claimed she was a foreign agent. They opened up another case against her in December, claiming that she had disseminated “fake news” about the Russian Army. Her family and her employer have denied these charges.
    

            Now, her family wants the US government to declare her wrongfully detained and treat her case with similar gravity to that of the other American journalist detained in Russia: Evan Gershkovich. A Russian court said Friday that Gershkovich, who has been declared wrongfully detained, was guilty of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison. The conviction and trial against Gershkovich were decried as a sham.
    

            Butorin, who spoke to CNN prior to Gershkovich’s verdict, also denounced the Wall Street Journal reporter’s detention and called for his immediate release. He expressed gratitude to the publication for raising the profile of Kurmasheva’s case.
    

            However, he noted that there has been a “double standard” from the US in its wrongful detention designations. Gershkovich was given the designation, which empowers the government to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap, within two weeks of his arrest. Butorin said he has not heard a good answer from the government about why his wife has not also been given a designation, and instead regularly hears “a set of talking points.”
    

            “It was absolutely the right thing to do to designate Evan as wrongfully detained. He is wrongfully detained. I consider Alsu to be wrongfully detained,” he said.
    

            “Obviously, she was detained and now remains in detention because of her work for an American media organization and her American citizenship, and they made it clear to her in no uncertain terms back in October that this was the reason why she was being detained,” Butorin said.
    

“Every time a court considered extending her pre-trial detention, her American citizenship was cited and was the primary reason for not releasing her under house arrest, because they consider her a flight risk.”
    

            On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller urged Kurmasheva’s “swift release,” but said he did not have “any new information to provide about a wrongful detention determination.”
    

            Another State Department spokesperson said they “are closely following the case of Alsu Kurmasheva, a dedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting.”
    

            US officials have never been granted access to see Butorin, who is jailed in Kazan, a city in the Tatarstan region in southwest Russia. In late May, her pretrial detention was once again extended until early August.
    

            The family has also not been allowed phone calls to Kurmasheva. She has been able to see her mother a few times, Butorin said. He said that video of her in court shows that her imprisonment has taken a toll on her health.
    

            The ongoing separation has been incredibly hard for the family. Butorin and Kurmasheva have two daughters — Bibi, who just turned 16, and Miriam, who is 12. They say it has been “really challenging” being away from her.
    

            “We need our mom,” Bibi told CNN. “These years of our lives are going by so quickly. It’s crazy to know how much we’ve grown up since she’s been away.”
    

            Butorin, Bibi, and Miriam described Kurmasheva as a kind and selfless person who was deeply involved in her community.
    

            “She really liked to spend time with us. She would always pick us up from school with snacks and we would play music in the car,” like Swift and Olivia Rodrigo, Bibi said.
    

            “It’s hurtful that she’s perceived as a criminal because that’s not who she is at all,” she said.

CNN_54,"Recovering from the global tech outage could be a long, arduous process",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/recovery-global-crowdstrike-outage/index.html,2024-07-19 23:54:00,us,"
            The company that caused a massive computer outage across the world says a flawed update has been rolled back – but that doesn’t necessarily help the thousands of businesses that have been affected by the glitch.
    

            The CrowdStrike software issue at the heart of the outage runs at such a deep level in affected computers and systems that getting them up and running just to be fixed will be, in many cases, an enormous challenge.
    

            That’s compounded by the fact that many of the servers that may contain information needed to get these systems working again are themselves caught in a cycle of crashing and rebooting.
    

            “I don’t think it’s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history,” said security expert Troy Hunt in a post on X.
    

The CrowdStrike software at fault operates at what’s called the kernel level of a computer, a much deeper level than what more ordinary applications such as browsers or video games do. This portion of a device has much greater visibility and control over a computer and its components, making it critical for the operation of all other systems — and far more sensitive.
    

            Running at the kernel level means CrowdStrike’s software can do more to detect cyberattacks, but it also means the current bug is causing Windows computers to crash to a Blue Screen of Death before users can take any actions to correct it.
    

            The issue appears to be recoverable, CrowdStrike has said, but in many cases it requires painstaking work: Each affected device must be accessed by an administrator and manually rebooted into safe mode. Then, the offending CrowdStrike file must be deleted by hand.
    

            For businesses with hundreds or thousands of laptops, desktops and servers running CrowdStrike’s security software, an individual human may have to perform that process over and over and over again.
    

            “You can’t automate that,” said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher and former Microsoft threat analyst, in a post on X. “So this is going to be incredibly painful for CrowdStrike customers.”
    

            It gets worse.
    

            Organizations that take security seriously will have likely encrypted their computers’ hard drives, making it even more challenging to access the file that needs to be deleted.
    

            For those organizations, “you need to manually decrypt the disk with a BitLocker Recovery Key, which is probably — for most companies — stored digitally on one of the servers that is currently booting over and over,” said Ira Bailey, a security researcher, in a post on BlueSky.
    

            Every affected computer that is BitLocker-encrypted will need to be unlocked with a recovery key before organizations can begin the process of deleting the bad CrowdStrike file and restoring normal operation, said the cybersecurity expert who goes by the pseudonymous handle SwiftOnSecurity in a post on X.
    

            Recovery will be enormously expensive for Fortune 500 companies with large teams of IT staff and likely even more challenging for smaller firms, Kenn White, an independent security researcher who specializes in network security, told CNN.
    

            “If you don’t have physical staff that can actually touch it, this is going to take many, many days for much of corporate America to recover from,” White said. “It’s just a ton of labor-intensive manual work.”
    

            “It’s a fairly complicated procedure for non-technical people,” White added, “and even a lot of skilled IT professionals will find it difficult to do this at the scale that’s going to be required given the number of machines that are affected.”
    

            Because CrowdStrike’s security software is running on countless individual computers all around the globe, the update that got pushed to those devices caused them all to shut down, virtually simultaneously.
    

            And in today’s networked economy, an outage in one part of a supply chain can cause  domino effects up and down the line. When multiple parts of a supply chain go down, it touches off a cascade of problems.
    

            Imagine a person trying to buy a coffee, said Andrew Peck, a cybersecurity expert at Loughborough University in the UK. What may seem like a simple transaction relies on multiple computers working in tandem, from the coffee shop’s point of sale to the payment processor’s own back-end systems.
    

            “There are a lot of computers in this chain, and usually the larger the business, the larger the chain,” Peck said. “If any one of the computers are down in the chain, the transaction will not complete.”
    

            Now scale that up to something like the massive aviation industry, the critical financial services sector or the life-or-death operations of a health care provider, and the scope of the disaster becomes starkly clear.
    

            A separate issue earlier, on Thursday, did lead to significant impacts on many of Microsoft’s own cloud customers, but it was resolved overnight and was unrelated to the CrowdStrike issue, multiple cybersecurity experts said.
    

            The CrowdStrike bug may have initially been conflated with the Microsoft issue because CrowdStrike’s error affected only Windows machines.
    

            “Both are Microsoft-related, but Microsoft had nothing to do with the second incident,” White told CNN.
    

            That appears to be supported by Microsoft’s own status account on X, which on Thursday announced an issue affecting “Microsoft 365 apps and services” and a separate announcement Friday addressing the CrowdStrike outage. The two issues are being tracked using different reference numbers.
    

            As of Friday morning, Microsoft said the issue with Microsoft 365 had been resolved and that the situation was improving. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

            Since the update to CrowdStrike’s software was delivered by the company’s own systems, it appears unlikely that Microsoft bears direct responsibility for Friday’s outages, said Beaumont, who said he reviewed a copy of CrowdStrike’s flawed update.
    

            The problem with CrowdStrike’s update was that it wasn’t formatted correctly “and causes Windows to crash every time,” Beaumont posted on X.

CNN_55,Thousands of Disneyland workers are expected to authorize a potential strike. It would be the first in 40 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/disneyland-workers-strike-authorization/index.html,2024-07-19 23:53:00,us,"
            Cyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight, so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them.
    

            But after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went “home” to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren’t enough to afford renting a place with a bed.
    

            Now, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where 9,500 of them will conclude a vote on Friday that will authorize a potential strike.
    

            If the vote passes, as it is virtually certain to do, it’s then up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney’s original resort in 40 years.
    

            Disneyland officials said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike.
    

            Union leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors’ and writers’ unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023.
    

            Strike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year.
    

            While this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage.
    

            Carranza ‘s Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors.
    

            “It’s upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I’m making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,” Carranza said.
    

            As of April 1, California’s minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort’s employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024.
    

            But in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough.
    

            After Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months’ rent for an apartment.
    

            Today, she shares an apartment with a roommate.
    

            Change at the Disneyland Resort – and in affordability in Southern California in general – has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years.
    

            When she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there’s utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn’t travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog.
    

            “It does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,” Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they’ve been doing around the park and telling them they’ve been brave to try the thrill rides.
    

            Palmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city’s minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour.
    

            Disneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage.
    

            A strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June.
    

            Another 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort’s other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments.
    

            Together, they represent about 40% of the entire resort’s employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now.
    

            The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.
    

            These groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors’ Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process.
    

            Officially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist.
    

            SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work.
    

            The NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing.
    

            Disneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks’ uniform policy and that only a “handful” of employees have been disciplined.
    

            Disneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests “an uninterrupted, immersive experience,” and that “anything that distracts from the show or story, be it a non-approved button, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.”
    

            The term “cast member” refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the façade.
    

            Disney’s policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the “show.” Only repeated violations would warrant any disciplinary action, starting with a verbal warning.

CNN_56,Election chaos and Friday’s tech outage are taking the market on a wild ride,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/investing/election-markets-your-money/index.html,2024-07-19 23:39:00,us,"
            Stocks are soaring this year, but that could soon change as election chaos takes the market on a rollercoaster ride.
    

            The S&P 500 is up more than 16% so far this year and hasn’t fallen by 2% in more than 353 trading sessions. That’s the longest such streak since 2007 (right before the financial collapse).
    

            But this has been a destabilizing week for US stocks and the market trajectory could be shifting.
    

            Investors have struggled to find their footing in recent days as they contend with an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, rising odds that President Joe Biden will drop out of the election, attacks on Big Tech and chipmakers from both sides of the aisle and a global computer outage affecting airports, banks, hospitals and other businesses.
    

            The Dow was down more than 430 points, or 1%, in the morning trading session on Friday as the tech outage continued to rattle investors. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both around 0.6% lower.

Airlines and businesses struggle to recover following global Microsoft outage


            It’s the latest session to see stocks oscillating this week, reaching new highs before swinging back down again.
    

            The S&P 500 posted a new record high on Tuesday. By Thursday, the index had logged its worst two-day decline since April — when Iran launched an attack on Israel. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022.
    

            The selloff “came amidst intense political uncertainty,” wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank, “as speculation continues to mount that President Biden will stand down as the Democratic nominee, perhaps before Monday according to many reports, which has the potential to completely upend the dynamics of the presidential election in November.”
    

            Investors crave stability, and with about 100 days left until the election, they’re worried that market mayhem has set in.
    

            So what does that mean for your money?
    

            The standard advice for investors is to invest for the long term and to avoid making any short-sighted election-inspired trades.
    

            “We do not favor making meaningful portfolio changes based on who you think might win the November election,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. “The economy’s trend seems to be a clearer signal for an investor than trying to predict the eventual market impact of any election.”
    

            Still, some argue that we’re in the midst of a larger market rotation.
    

            For the last two years, the stock market has been tied to the Federal Reserve’s actions. Inflation and interest rates have been a guiding light for markets: A higher-than-expected inflation reading or tough speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have frequently thrown stocks into freefall. Meanwhile, any data that shows signs of a crack in the job market has sent stocks soaring as investors bet on impending rate cuts.
    

            Now, investors are parrying that central bankers will finally cut interest rates in September after first signaling a move last December. And they’re celebrating. Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategies at SoFi, said she also thinks that investors might be more certain about the election than before, as President Donald Trump has seen better polling in the days following an attempt on his life.

Key takeaways from Fed Chair Powell’s testimony on Capitol Hill


            One clear indication of that celebration is the return of small-cap stocks.
    

            Smaller companies typically outperform large caps in declining-interest-rate environments because it’s cheaper for them to borrow money and grow. This makes them more attractive to investors looking for better returns.
    

            In just seven trading days, the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) has moved more than 10% higher. Before the move, the S&P 500 was outperforming the Russell 2000 by 16% year-to-date. That gap has narrowed to just 6%.
    

            “The new information has been a combination of lower US Treasury yields, cooler inflation data, and increased risk appetite on the possibility of a more certain US election outcome,” said Young Thomas. The earnings data helps to confirm that the move has fundamental support from the index, but likely wasn’t the driving force.”
    

            Part of the reckoning between large-cap and small-cap stocks has been due to the sudden tech selloff.
    

            As expectations increase that the Fed will begin cutting rates in the fall, investors are starting to move out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that fueled record highs this year.

Dow closes more than 500 points lower and tech rout continues


            Tech stocks took an additional pummeling this week after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.
    

            Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said in an interview with Bloomberg that Taiwan should pay for its own defense. “They did take about 100% of our chip business,” Trump said. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are down 10% over the past five days.
    

            On Friday, a massive global outage of Microsoft’s Windows operating system, caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity company ​​CrowdStrike, furthered the tech stock rout.
    

            Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are on pace to close the week lower.
    

            Investors have been largely resilient this year and some financial bigwigs say the election won’t change that.
    

            JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum said during an earnings call last week that even though the election cycle is making big news, it isn’t “financially material in the context of earnings.”
    

            The current economic environment, he said, is “no different than any other.”

            The highly infectious polio virus has been found in sewage samples in Gaza, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.
    

            Gaza’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) both said they had carried out tests and found samples of the virus in sewage water.
    

            “Poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) had been identified at six locations in sewage samples collected on 23 June from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah,” WHO said Friday.
    

            WHO said the findings are linked to the “disastrous sanitation situation” created by Israel’s brutal military assault in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7.
    

            “It is important to note the virus has been isolated from the environment only at this time; no associated paralytic cases have been detected,” WHO added. It said no one has yet been treated in Gaza for paralysis or other symptoms of polio, but that residents must now “contend with the threat” posed by the disease.

            Various United Nations agencies – including UNICEF, the children’s fund, and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees – are working with local health authorities to determine how far the virus has spread.
    

            WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said polio vaccination rates prior to the conflict were “optimal,” but that Israel’s war against Hamas had created “the perfect environment for diseases like polio to spread.”
    

            “The decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,” Tedros warned.
    

            The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza called for practices to improve hygiene and safety.
    

            “Detecting the virus that causes polio in sewage portends a real health disaster and exposes thousands of residents to the risk of contracting polio,” it said in a statement, demanding “an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression.”
    

            Wild polio was eradicated from Gaza more than 25 years ago, with pre-war vaccination coverage reaching 95% in 2022, according to WHO.
    

            Poliovirus can emerge when poor vaccination coverage allows the weakened form of the orally administered vaccine virus strain to mutate into a stronger version capable of causing paralysis, a spokesman from WHO’s global Polio Eradication program said.

            The United Nations’ top court said on Friday that Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal in an advisory opinion.
    

            The opinion from the International Court of Justice stated that “Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible.”
    

            An advisory opinion is not legally binding but carries moral authority and can shape international law, according to the ICJ.

            Judge Nawaf Salam, the president of the ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, said the court observed that “large-scale confiscation of land and the degradation of access to natural resources divests the local population of their basic means of subsistence thus inducing their departure.”
    

            The court also found that the declaration of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital helped to “entrench Israel’s control of the occupied Palestinian territory.”
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians rejected the opinion.
    

            “The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “Neither in our eternal capital Jerusalem nor in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,” referring to the occupied West Bank.
    

            “No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested,” the prime minister said.
    

            Foreign Minister Israel Katz also condemned the ICJ advisory opinion, calling it “fundamentally warped, one-sided, and wrong.”

CNN_59,Adidas apologizes for ad campaign linked to 1972 Munich Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/adidas-apologizes-ad-campaign-bella-hadid-spt-intl-scli/index.html,2024-07-19 23:50:00,world,"
Adidas has apologized for “any upset or distress caused,” after releasing an ad campaign for some retro sneakers based on a model first released during the 1972 Munich Olympics.
    

            The Munich Olympics are infamous as the event in which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and murdered by the Palestinian terror group known as “Black September.”
    

            The controversy centered around the German sportswear company’s choice of model Bella Hadid to front the campaign. Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel.
    

            Adidas’ decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage.
    

            CNN cannot independently verify Adidas’ posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel’s official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas’ website promoting the sneakers. Hadid’s representatives have not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Hadid hasn’t publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself – uncaptioned – standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer’s tops.
    

            “We are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events – though these are completely unintentional – and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,” a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday.

            “As a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,” the company added.
    

            Hadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.
    

            In October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: “My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,” referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza – now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health.
    

            “I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,” she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage.
    

            For the American Jewish Committee, choosing a “vocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.”
    

            “Neither is acceptable,” it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was “anti-Israel.”

            Meanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt – the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League – wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid’s involvement in the campaign is a “serious misjudgement that dishonors the victims” of the 1972 terrorist attack.
    

            However, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid.
    

            “Bella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists – other than the fact that she is Palestinian,” Hasan posted on X.
    

            “Blaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,” he added.
    

            When contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its “criticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,” without providing evidence for these allegations.
    

            The Adidas controversy comes a week before the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics.

CNN_60,Tiger Woods misses third consecutive major cut; vows it’s not an Open goodbye,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/tiger-woods-open-championship-cut-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-19 23:23:00,world,"
Tiger Woods has made an early exit from the Open Championship, but the US golfer has vowed to be back for the 2025 major.
    

            A second round six-over 77 at Royal Troon in Scotland on Friday improved upon an opening 79, but left the 48-year-old well short of the projected cut line for the top-70 players at 14-over par overall.
    

            It ties the three-time Open champion’s highest ever 36-hole score of his major career, according to golf statistician Justin Ray, shot at the US Open in 2015 – the only previous season he had missed three consecutive cuts at the sport’s four flagship events.
    

            “Just was fighting it pretty much all day,” Woods, who finished 60th at the Masters in April before failing to make the weekend at both the PGA Championship and US Open, told reporters.
    

            “I never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys.”
    

            Signing off with par, Woods was given a standing ovation as crowds swarmed behind the ropes to get a last glimpse of him at Royal Troon, yet the 15-time major winner insisted it would not be his final Open.
    

            Woods – who is automatically qualified for the tournament as a result of his victories in 2000, 2005 and 2006 – said he will “definitely” be returning for next year’s 153rd edition of the major at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, in what would be his 24th outing at the event.
    

            The 82-time PGA Tour winner had arrived at Royal Troon adamant that he will play as long as he feels he can still win, shunning former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie’s suggestion he should consider retiring.

            This season marks the first since his 2021 car crash that Woods has competed at all four majors. In February, he had expressed his desire to compete in one tournament a month but – despite “physically feeling a lot better” than at the beginning of the year – has only competed in five official events in 2024.
    

            “I loved it. I’ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,” he said Friday.
    

            “Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn’t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did.
    

            “Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high,” Woods, who shot just his sixth career major round of eight over or worse on Thursday, added.
    

            Playing partner and May’s PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who followed up an opening two-under 69 with a 72, said Thursday he could empathize with Woods’ fight for sharpness.
    

            “He’s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he’s hard on himself too,” Schauffele told reporters.
    

            “He’s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can’t do. I’m sure he’d like to prep more at home if his body would allow it … I know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level. If your body is not letting you do it, it’s just frustrating.”

CNN_61,US sanctions alleged Russian hackers who claimed attacks on US water facilities,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/us-sanctions-alleged-russian-hackers/index.html,2024-07-20 00:28:00,politics,"
            The US Treasury Department on Friday sanctioned two alleged members of a Russian cybercriminal gang that has claimed responsibility for a slew of hacks against US critical infrastructure providers, including a cyberattack in January that caused a tank at a Texas water facility to overflow.
    

            Treasury posted photos of the two alleged hackers — Yuliya Vladimirovna Pankratova and Denis Olegovich Degtyarenko — unmasking them from the anonymous social media accounts that they tend to hide behind.
    

            Pankratova and Degtyarenko are allegedly part of a politically motivated hacking group called Cyber Army of Russia Reborn (CARR) that has claimed credit for a series of cyberattacks against American and European organizations in support of Russia.
    

            The string of hacks alarmed US officials because of how easy they were to pull off. The hackers logged into sensitive industrial software system that is supposed to be separated from the public internet. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan appealed to state officials and water authorities to shore up their cyber defenses.
    

            The hack in January in the small town of Muleshoe, in north Texas, wasted tens of thousands of gallons of water, according to the Treasury Department. It coincided with at least two other towns in north Texas taking precautionary defensive measures.
    

            Sanctions against criminal hackers are increasingly common as the US government tries to deter both politically and financially motivated computer operatives.
    

            Among CARR’s other claimed targets was a wastewater treatment plant in Indiana. The hackers tend to blend their unsophisticated hacking efforts with psychological operations designed to drum up interests in the group and spread panic among targets. They have, for example, released videos of them purporting to infiltrate water systems set to dramatic music.
    

            “Russia continues to provide a safe haven to cybercriminals and enable their malicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement on Friday.
    

            “While CARR’s lack of sophistication and victims’ responses have thus far prevented any instances of major damage, unauthorized access to critical infrastructure systems poses an elevated risk of harm to the public and can result in devastating humanitarian consequences,” Miller said.

CNN_62,Nearly 2 dozen families claim owner of Houston surrogacy escrow company stole millions to fund lavish lifestyle,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/us/houston-surrogacy-escrow-company-fraud-scheme-lawsuit/index.html,2024-07-20 00:13:00,us,"
            Nearly two dozen families are listed in a lawsuit accusing the owner of a Houston-based surrogacy escrow company of stealing millions of dollars from their accounts, intended to pay their surrogates and cover medical expenses, to fund her lavish lifestyle.
    

            The lawsuit claims that Surrogacy Escrow Account Management LLC, or SEAM, and its owner, Dominique Side, systemically misappropriated millions of escrow dollars, allegedly using the funds to enrich herself and fund side businesses – including a clothing line and a career as a rap and R&B singer and producer. 


            The escrow funds also paid for Side’s “lavish trips all over the world,” designer clothing, luxury vehicles, real estate, and membership at the “Soho House,” a chain of private clubs, the filing alleges.
    

            The lawsuit was initially filed by one family last month, but 22 additional families across the country – as well as prospective parents in France and Italy – asked to join the lawsuit, the plaintiffs’ attorney announced Tuesday, claiming there are “hundreds more families” that have been victimized by SEAM’s conduct. 


            The lawsuit alleges that Side and the other defendants “have lured families and their surrogates into entering into a fiduciary relationship with SEAM so they could steal their escrow funds” for their benefit.
    

            SEAM provides surrogacy escrow account management services to couples and women who have agreed to act as their surrogates. The company has an obligation as the intended parents’ escrow agent to hold escrow funds, review the expenses incurred by their surrogates and distribute payments to the surrogate, the lawsuit states.
    

            During a court hearing on Wednesday, a judge issued a temporary injunction, ordering funds and assets of the defendants be frozen for the duration of the lawsuit. A trial in the case has been scheduled to begin in January 2025, according to the judge’s order.
    

            Last month, the FBI said in a news release it was “seeking to identify potential victims” of SEAM and asked any other potential victims to fill out an online form.
    

            The lawsuit, filed in June in the district court of Harris County in Texas, names Side as a defendant, along with one of her business partners, Anthony Hall and Life Escrow, LLC, an escrow company created by Hall.
    

            The judge’s order says in March, Hall formed a new escrow company called Life Escrow, LLC, which is located at the same business address as SEAM.
    

Dominique and SEAM “may have transferred any escrow funds remaining in SEAM’s accounts” as of June 14 to bank accounts in the name of Life Escrow, according to the judge’s order.
    

            CNN has reached out to Hall for comment on the lawsuit and did not receive a response. But in a statement posted on his Facebook page, Hall said he defended himself from the accusations in court and has agreed “to turn over specific assets I control that can be traced to the alleged mismanagement by Ms. Side.
    

            “I also presented a sworn affidavit from Ms. Side that’s states I have no insight or access to any of the funds or, processes of SEAM. Also it states that no monies have been transferred to me fraudulently,” Hall said.
    

            Hall added that Life Escrow was a passion project he started in 2023 that “has no financial accounts, or clients,” and was “not a front for illegal activity.”
    

            In an automatic reply to an email sent by CNN, Side said she and her company “have been notified” that we are subject to an active investigation by federal authorities.”
    

            “Under advice of counsel, I am not permitted to respond to any inquiries regarding the investigation,” her reply continued.
    

            In a statement on behalf of the families, attorney Marianne Robak said: “This is an important step for our legal team as we fight to help those affected by this scheme receive the recovery and answers they deserve.”
    

            “We will continue to investigate where the money went and the best course of action to hold the defendants accountable for their deceitful actions,” the statement continued.
    

            The lawsuit describes the defendants’ actions as “nothing short of evil,” and says more than 800 families who belong to a private Facebook group for victims of the alleged scheme have been defrauded by SEAM and its owner for over $16 million.
    

            Mindy and Aaron Herstein who are not part of the lawsuit but who are members of the Facebook group told CNN they are down $50,000 after using SEAM’s escrow services to pay a surrogate who is now 24 weeks pregnant. They say after a devastating stillbirth and health problems, they chose surrogacy as it was still their dream to have a child.
    

            “We are heartbroken and devastated about losing the money that was supposed to be safely managed in a trusted escrow account for our surrogate as that is how she was paid. Now we are down 50K, and I do not see this money ever being returned. I feel for everyone going through this at this time,” Mindy told CNN.
    

            The families each deposited between $31,000 and $100,000 into a SEAM escrow account, only some of which was used to pay surrogates, the lawsuit said.
    

            “Troubles with SEAM came to light in June when expectant parents who had each deposited tens of thousands of dollars to pay women carrying their children learned instead that their money was apparently lost,” the plaintiffs’ attorney said in a Tuesday news release. “Initially, it looked as though millions had vanished.”
    

            The families were notified by SEAM on June 4 their accounts had been put “on hold” by Capital One Bank due to “fraudulent charges,” the judge’s order states.
    

            Ten days later, Side informed all of the company’s clients in an email: “Due to legal action all operations have been placed on hold. At this time, I am unable to provide further details regarding the matter,” according to the order.
    

            The judge cited evidence that shows SEAM’s escrow accounts do not have enough funds to pay the families’ escrow fees, and the 23 families incurred damages ranging from roughly $12,400 to $90,400 – totaling over $1 million, not including attorney fees.
    

            “The evidence shows that it is likely – and probable – that SEAM misappropriated millions of its clients’ escrow funds,” the judge wrote.
    

            The judge determined the intended parents have a probable right to recovering their claims because it appears likely the defendants transferred SEAM’s assets “in order to hinder, delay or defraud SEAM’s creditors.”
    

            The families’ forensic accountant reviewed bank records that show SEAM transferred the escrow funds into an operating account, most of which was then transferred to other bank accounts, the order says.
    

            Bank records show Side transferred more than $2.2 million to launch her career as “Dom,” a “racy rap and R&B singer and music producer,” according to the filing. She allegedly used some of the funds to create music videos and social media content.

            The records also show SEAM transferred nearly $5 million to pay for a credit card that “appears to be related” to a music studio that was owned by Side and Hall, along with $275,000 to Side’s clothing line.
    

            In October 2023, a designer clothing company named Nikki Green, LLC – partially owned by Side and Hall – showcased its clothing line at Fashion Week in Las Vegas, which was funded with the parents’ escrow funds, the lawsuit says.
    

            The lawsuit alleges the defendants committed fraud by failing to disclose the whereabouts and the status of their client’s funds, as part of a larger scheme to defraud the families of their escrow funds.
    

            “Records reveal that SEAM, Dominique and their other Defendants have been methodically transferring the Intended Parents’ escrow funds out of SEAM’s bank accounts for their personal use, for years,” according to the suit. “As a result, hundreds of families are unable to financially assist their surrogates or ensure the safe delivery of their babies.”

            Thousands of US flights were grounded Friday morning as a technical disaster impacted businesses worldwide – leading to cancellations, delays and confusion at airports across the country.
    

            A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world.
    

            As of Friday morning, more than 2,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers to not come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights.

CNN_64,Israel investigates security failures around deadly Tel Aviv drone strike,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-20 01:46:00,world,"
            Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday.
    

            The attack was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel’s war in Gaza. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare’e said the operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”
    

            “We will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy’s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,” Sare’e said. “Our operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”
    

            The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis.
    

            In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.
    

             A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.
    

            An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to “human error.” It was armed with a warhead and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device’s payload.
    

            The official didn’t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel’s aerial defense systems don’t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile.
    

            According to an initial inquiry “no sirens were activated” during the incident, the IDF said earlier.
    

            Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was “shocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack” and sent his condolences to the victims’ families. “We are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,” he added.
    

            The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities.
    

            There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or “locally engaged staff,” the US State Department said.
    

            “We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,” the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.
    

            Emergency crews responded to “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.
    

            “The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said.
    

            Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government “cannot give security to the citizens of Israel.”
    

            “There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,” he said.
    

            Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are “precisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel’s policy.”
    

            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country’s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join.
    

            The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country’s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses.
    

            The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped.
    

            Israel’s air and ground offensive on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip’s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.

The shipping industry is sounding the alarm as another vessel sinks in the Red Sea


            The war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world’s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes.
    

            Sare’e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called “Yafa” that can “bypass the enemy’s interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.”
    

            Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn’t be taken at face value.
    

            “In general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,” he wrote, adding that “their factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran’s or Lebanese Hezbollah’s.”
    

            He said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, “the Houthi’s standard long-range strike drone” that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine.
    

            For the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive “as it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.”
    

            Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel’s defenses failed to intercept it.
    

            “They will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,” Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group’s weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack “gives momentum” to these rallies, he said.
    

            The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.
    

            The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

CNN_65,Paul Whelan tells CNN he has ‘sympathy and empathy’ for Evan Gershkovich but expresses hope following sentencing,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/index.html,2024-07-20 02:46:00,politics,"
Paul Whelan, an American detained in Russia, told CNN he has “sympathy and empathy” for Evan Gershkovich following the conviction and sentencing of the Wall Street Journal reporter, but expressed hope that the development could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release.
    

            Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing.
    

            “The only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there’s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,” he described.
    

            Whelan was arrested in December 2018 and, like Gershkovich, was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in prison on espionage charges that he and the US government vehemently deny. Whelan has also been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department.
    

            “I’m sympathetic and empathetic to him and his family because I understand what they’re going through and my family certainly understands what they’re going through,” the ex-Marine continued. “It’s something that you just can’t fathom, especially if you’re a tourist or like Evan, he was just doing his job, and you end up in a cage, in a courtroom, being told that you have to spend 16 years of hard labor.”
    

            However, Whelan expressed hope that the speed with which the Russian government carried out the trial, which was decried as a sham, and sentencing could signal that Moscow is open to moving forward on negotiations to bring them both home. In the cases of Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner, the Russian government has insisted on having a conviction before the negotiations on the swaps that secured their release moved forward.
    

            “We think that could be a good sign that the Russians want to actually now start negotiations with the US for his release as well as mine,” he said.
    

            Whelan said he would advise Gershkovich to “keep a stiff upper lip, keep his chin up.”
    

            Whelan noted that he was moved to the remote prison colony “without notice” – “it was a two o’clock in the morning, they took me and put me on a train from Moscow to Mordovia” – “so he needs to be prepared for that sort of thing.” He also advised the wrongfully detained journalist to “mentally prepare himself to enter the Russian prison system.”
    

            “It’s very different, probably, than what he’s used to in the pretrial center,” he said.
    

            Whelan was positive about the US government efforts underway to secure their release.
    

            Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier Friday that the US government is working “quite literally every day” to bring Gershkovich and Whelan home.
    

            “We’re working it as we speak, and we’re not going to stop until we get Evan home, ‘til we (get)Paul Whelan home, ‘til we get others home,” Blinken said at the Aspen Security Forum.
    

            Asked why the Russians would negotiate now when “it’s such a huge bargaining chip” with the next administration, Blinken downplayed the impact of the election on the negotiations.
    

            “Look, any effort to bring any American home is going to be part of a process of back-and-forth discussion, potentially negotiation. And, depending on what the other side is looking for, they’ll reach their own conclusions about whether it meets whatever their needs are, and we can bring someone home. And I don’t think that’s dependent on an election in the United States or anywhere else,” he said.

CNN_66,First lady Dr. Jill Biden to host fundraiser in Paris amid campaign chaos,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/jill-biden-fundraiser-paris/index.html,2024-07-20 02:27:00,politics,"
            First lady Dr. Jill Biden will host a fundraiser while she’s in Paris leading the US delegation to the Olympic Games opening ceremony in Paris later this month, the Biden-Harris campaign said.
    

            The event will be hosted by former US Ambassador to the EU Tony Gardner, Belinda de Gaudemar, and Lorna Johnson. Tickets range from $500-$25,000. As only Americans can donate to US campaigns, they will have to show a copy of their passport photo page to ensure compliance with federal election law, the campaign said.
    

            The fundraiser comes at a time of uncertainty for Biden’s campaign – during which donations have been drying up. Her attendance comes at a pivotal moment for her husband’s candidacy, as a growing number of Democrats have called on the president to step aside. The first lady remains the president’s closest adviser and fiercest protector, wielding influence in the White House and campaign. She has been an active surrogate on the campaign trail, criss-crossing the country on his behalf as she works to bolster his support with key coalitions.

            Biden will lead the US delegation to the Olympic Games opening ceremony in Paris, cheering on America’s athletes on behalf of the Biden administration.
    

            The opening ceremony is on July 26. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff will lead the delegation to the closing ceremony on August 11, the White House said in a statement. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will lead delegations to the Paralympic Games opening and closing ceremonies, respectively, later in August.
    

            Biden is also expected to attend some Olympics events during her trip to Paris, a White House official said.
    

            The first lady previously led the US delegation to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, which were rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At the time, Biden provided a dose of normalcy to an otherwise highly unusual Olympics rife with Covid restrictions, including mask mandates and virtually empty stadiums.
    

            Decked in Team USA apparel, Biden was seen cheering, clapping, and at times agonizing over the games, a cheerleader mom stand-in for the American athletes whose parents could not be there in person. She also offered encouragement to Team USA in a Zoom pep rally. 


            Months later, the US did not send an official delegation to the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, a diplomatic boycott due to human rights abuses in China. 


            Biden previously attended the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games as then-second lady.

            Thousands of US flights were grounded Friday as a technical disaster plagued government agencies and businesses worldwide – leading to countless stranded passengers, canceled medical procedures and disrupted 911 services.
    

            A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world.

What is CrowdStrike, the company responsible for the global outage?


            As of Friday afternoon, more than 2,400 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com.
    

            Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers to not come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events.
    

            “Tomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon,” said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport – which had the most cancellations Friday morning.
    

            “And then on Sunday, I have my sister’s 50th birthday party,” Kelley said. But it’s not clear when or if she’ll make it to those events: “It’s really chaotic. It’s frustrating. And I’ve never experienced anything like this.”
    

Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses


            The Federal Aviation Administration “is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the agency posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”
    

            Kurtz later told NBC, “We’re resolving and have resolved the issue.” 


            “As systems come back online, as they’re rebooted, they’re coming up and they’re working,” Kurtz said on the “Today” show. However, Kurtz said, it could be “some time” for certain systems that won’t just automatically recover.
    

            Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation.
    

            “Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. “We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”
    

            – Delta Air Lines “paused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,” it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.
    

            – JetBlue operations “remain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,” the airline said in an email to CNN. However, “Customers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.”
    

            – American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. “Earlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,” American said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”

            – United Airlines said it was resuming “some flights” early Friday morning. United cautioned travelers they might experience delays and issued waivers for eligible customers to change their travel plans.
    

            – Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines said they were having difficulties involving booking, check-in and trip-managing functions online. The FAA announced Friday morning that all Allegiant flights would be grounded.
    

            – Numerous international airlines reported technical disruptions, including Virgin Australia and Qantas, along with airports across Europe and Asia-Pacific.
    

            The calamity also struck hospitals and federal agencies, forcing each to scramble for solutions.
    

            “Many of our Microsoft-based computer systems have been affected by the worldwide technology outage,” Cincinnati Children’s hospital posted on X. “Our teams are working hard to minimize disruption to patient care and system operations, and we are bringing systems back up as quickly as possible.”

            “Mass General Brigham remains open to provide care to patients with urgent health concerns in our clinics and emergency departments, and we continue to care for all patients currently receiving care in our hospitals.”
    

            The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”
    

            And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, “local Social Security offices are closed to the public today,” the Social Security Administration’s website said.
    

            The technical disaster has affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.
    

            In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration.
    

            “City services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,” the mayor’s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted.
    

            But in Alaska, many 911 and non-emergency call centers weren’t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored.
    

            In New Hampshire, some 911 services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire 911 said in a post.
    

            Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department’s computerized 911 dispatch center. “Our 911 center remains operational. If you need to call 911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,” Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its “systems have been restored.”
    

            In New York City, 911 services are operational, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.
    

            “FDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,” New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide 911 outages.
    

            “We’re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,” the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. “We’re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”
    

            In some states, driver services grinded to a halt due to the technical problems.
    

            North Carolina’s driver’s license and plate services are “unable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume “once the global outage has been repaired.”
    

            Georgia’s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable “Due to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.”
    

            And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning.
    

            “The Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,” the agency said. “We apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.”
    

            The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is “absolutely insane” as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said.
    

             “It’s getting really hot in here,” Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations.

            “Nobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system’s down, our system’s down,” New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN.
    

            She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. “I want to get home to my son,” Small said. But she doesn’t think she’ll be able to go home until Saturday.

CNN_68,Secret Service boosts and rethinks security for first Trump-Vance rally and campaign,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/secret-service-trump-vance-rally-security/index.html,2024-07-20 03:49:00,politics,"
            The US Secret Service is scrambling to increase security ahead of former President Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the failed assassination attempt on his life last week, sources familiar with the planning told CNN.
    

            The security around Trump’s future rallies and events is being entirely rethought, including where they should be held – whether indoors or in more secure outdoor locations. Outdoor events for Trump like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated, will likely be severely limited, sources said, if not entirely done away with.
    

            The ramp up in security reflects several new assessments by law enforcement since Saturday’s shooting, officials familiar with the assessments told CNN, including concern about a possible copycat incident and others who may be inspired to carry out another attack after seeing the previous one narrowly fail.

            Multiple people familiar with the planning for this weekend’s rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at an indoor arena said that both Secret Service and local law enforcement have recently increased the number of officers who will work on securing the event.
    

            During a board of commissioners meeting on Thursday, Kent County, Michigan, Undersheriff Bryan Muir said the sheriff’s office was given a “last-minute request” from the Secret Service for 50 to 60 officers from the department to help with security for the rally.
    

            “We assist the Secret Service,” a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office told CNN, adding that the Secret Service was leading all security planning for the rally. “We just provide assistance.”
    

            The security apparatus around Trump has entirely changed in recent days, people familiar with the matter have told CNN, including through local law enforcement.
    

            An example of this increased security occurred late Thursday night and into Friday morning, when a New Jersey law enforcement helicopter circled the Newark airport dozens of times until Trump’s plane arrived and he was secured in his motorcade following his speech at the Republican National Convention.
    

            Security around Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence has also changed in recent days, with new road closures announced by the Palm Beach Police Department on Thursday which will last through the 2024 election.
    

            “Due to enhanced security measures involving Mar a Lago and U.S. Secret Service-protected persons, South Ocean Boulevard will be closed to through traffic,” the department said, adding that the closure around Mar-a-Lago would be “in effect 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, until the November general election at a minimum.”

            One source familiar with the security planning said the shooting will prompt numerous exercises between local and federal law enforcement agencies on how to handle large events, exercises that have been reduced since the Covid-19 pandemic. The source said the lack of these exercises have resulted in security gaps, including communication breakdowns between law enforcement partners.
    

            The source added that after-action reports, like those coming from last Saturday’s shooting, immediately change the way security is handled at similar future events, including how exits and entrances are protected, widening the buffer zone, and other public safety measures.
    

            Saturday’s rally in Grand Rapids will be the first official campaign rally with both Trump and Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance.
    

            Asked if Michigan State Police would be involved in security for Saturday’s rally, director of communications Shanon Banner told CNN the department doesn’t discuss security procedures.
    

            “The Secret Service is responsible for the security planning for presidential visits, but we stand ready to assist them with whatever they need,” Banner wrote in an email.
    

            The Secret Service would not comment on security planning for the rally or Trump.

            Peters has pleaded not guilty to 10 state charges — including three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant; one felony account of criminal impersonation; two felony counts of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation; one felony count of identity theft; and misdemeanor counts for first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with requirements of the Colorado secretary of state — after an apparent security breach in Mesa County’s elections office in May 2021.
    

            The criminal investigation into the clerk’s office began after Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, accused Peters and her deputies of facilitating the 2021 security breach. The breach resulted in confidential voting machine logins and forensic images of their hard drives being published in a QAnon-affiliated Telegram channel in early August 2021.
    

            The Colorado breach was one of several incidents after 2020 where allies of former President Donald Trump tampered with election systems in hopes of proving his voter fraud claims. Loosely affiliated groups of Trump supporters orchestrated similar breaches in Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and others are facing charges.
    

            Peters’ trial is set to begin on July 29.
    

            Two lower courts have rejected Peters’ attempt to throw out the criminal case. Peters has argued that she was acting “pursuant to an express federal order to preserve election records” and is therefore immune from prosecution.
    

            “No serious argument, supported by any credible evidence, has been advanced that Ms. Peters’ conduct was unreasonable or unnecessary to fulfill her federal duty to preserve election records,” her attorneys told the Supreme Court, adding that the state indictment against her is a “transparently punitive move to criminalize her efforts to comply with federal law.”
    

            Peters is asking the high court to pause the impending trial so they can file a more fulsome appeal to the justices. It’s possible that the court will set a briefing schedule in the coming days as it considers her request to halt the state court proceedings.
    

            Peters was sentenced in April 2023 to four months of home detention after being found guilty of obstructing a government operation in a separate case.

            Louisiana will delay implementing a requirement that the Ten Commandments be placed in all of the state’s public school classrooms until at least November, according to an agreement approved by a federal judge Friday.
    

A lawsuit was filed in June by parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty.

Louisiana classrooms now required by law to display the Ten Commandments


            Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because the commandments are historical and are part of the foundation of US law.
    

            In 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The high court found the law had no secular purpose but rather served a plainly religious purpose.
    

            In 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

            At least 40 people have died after the boat they were traveling in caught fire off the coast of Haiti earlier this week, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported on Friday, citing local authorities.
    

            The vessel left Haiti on Wednesday carrying over 80 migrants, and was headed to Turks and Caicos, the IOM said. Forty-one survivors were rescued by Haiti’s Coast Guard, it also said.
    

            In a statement, Grégoire Goodstein, IOM’s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti’s spiraling security crisis and the lack of “safe and legal pathways for migration.”
    

            “Haiti’s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,” he said.
    
As more Kenyan troops are headed to the Caribbean nation, Haiti grapples with a hunger crisis.

Hunger in Haiti spreads amid ongoing gang violence


            Haiti is grappling with gang violence, a collapsing health system, and a lack of access to essential supplies, leading many Haitians to embark on dangerous journeys out of the country.
    

            The Caribbean nation’s crisis escalated earlier this year when gang warfare exploded, forcing the resignation of the then-government. The number of migration attempts by boat from Haiti have risen since then, according to IOM data.
    

            But chaos in the country has not stopped neighboring governments from repatriating Haitian migrants by the tens of thousands.
    

            “More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti by neighboring countries this year. In March, despite a surge in violence and the closure of airports throughout the country, forced returns increased by 46 per cent, reaching 13,000 forced returns in March alone,” the agency said in its statement.
    

            In recent weeks, the appointment of new Prime Minister Garry Conille and the arrival of several hundred foreign forces to bolster Haiti’s National Police have offered new hope for addressing the crisis. The United Nations Security Council-backed Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, led by Kenya, is now beginning operations in Haitian capital Port-au-Prince.

CNN_73,Investigators piece together a puzzling portrait of the shooter who sought to assassinate Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/trump-rally-gunman-portrait-motive-invs/index.html,2024-07-20 04:53:00,politics,"
            After conducting more than 200 interviews and combing through his phone and internet search history, federal investigators have pieced together an early portrait of the man who sought to assassinate former President Donald Trump: Thomas Matthew Crooks was an intelligent, unassuming loner, who expressed an interest in guns and was far from outspoken about politics.
    

            But the emerging profile of Crooks nearly a week after the shooting has left authorities puzzled about a motive for his assault and has had investigators speculating that his intentions may have been less politically motivated and more about attacking the highest-profile target near him.
    

            The investigation remains in its early stages, officials caution. Still, in some ways, Crooks seems similar to the dozens of other young men who’ve wreaked havoc across the US with high-powered assault-style rifles in recent years. He had few close friends, he would often go shooting at a local firing range, and he didn’t seem to display strongly held views that would suggest a politically driven assassination, according to CNN interviews with law enforcement and a review of notes from a briefing to Congress.
    

            In addition to the former president, Crooks had searched online about President Joe Biden and had photos on his phone of other prominent figures from both parties. He searched for the location of Trump’s rally as well as the upcoming Democratic National Convention, the briefing notes say, and discovered that Trump planned to appear just an hour’s drive away from his home in the Pittsburgh suburbs.
    

            That suggests Crooks may have been looking to carry out a high-profile shooting, and the Trump event’s proximity and timing offered the most accessible opportunity, federal officials have speculated.
    

            “Even though he didn’t get his primary target, the shooter was successful in a lot of ways because he got closer to doing something no one has done in decades,” one federal official told CNN, referring to the assassination of a presidential candidate.
    

            It remains unclear if Crooks intended to carry out a much larger attack and started with Trump because that was the way to gain the most notoriety.
    

            Crooks had also searched for information on another recent mass shooter who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021. The web searches about that shooter, Ethan Crumbley, are consistent with what law enforcement officials have seen in other mass shooters who research people they wish to emulate, in part, as a way to form their own idea of how to do something bigger, the federal official said.
    

            But there are also significant differences between Crooks’ behavior and that of a typical mass shooter. On the day of the attack, Crooks appeared to have been specifically targeting Trump – not aiming at the crowds in an attempt to kill as many people as possible. While he had an improvised explosive in the trunk of his car, it’s not clear if he planned to set it off to kill people or as a distraction.
    

            Kathleen Puckett, a former FBI behavioral analyst who worked on the case of the “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, said that Crooks also appeared to have less firepower than many mass shooters, who often carry multiple weapons and wear body armor.
    

            “It didn’t look to me like he was ready for an assault,” Puckett said, while noting the limits of publicly available information. “It looked to me like he was taking a window that he saw a vulnerability in where he felt that he was unobserved to the extent he could get off some critical shots.”
    

            In addition, unlike other mass shooters who often leave behind writings to explain their attacks, authorities have thus far recovered few clues, in Crooks’ bedroom or online.
    

            That is frustrating experts who are trying to piece together his mindset – and raising comparisons with Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017. Nearly seven years after America’s deadliest mass shooting, investigators still do not know why Paddock pulled the trigger.
    

            Like the Las Vegas massacre, “this may be a situation where the more we know, the less we understand about the exact reason why,” said Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a CNN national security analyst.
    

            Crooks’ family members told investigators he did not openly discuss politics, and evidence recovered at his home shed no further light on his political values or ideology, according to a readout shared with CNN that details a briefing that FBI and US Secret Service officials gave lawmakers Wednesday.

Trump’s team wasn’t told about reports of suspicious person before rally shooting, sources say


            Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former FBI profiler, said that based on the evidence assembled so far, she thought that Trump’s rally was “very appealing” to Crooks in part because it “fell in his backyard.”
    

            “This gave him incredible attention and catapulted him to a point where I think that’s why he chose this,” she speculated.
    

            Still, Puckett called lone offenders – who largely remain invisible before attacks – “one of the prickliest problems out there” for law enforcement, and warned against a rush to find simple answers about Crooks’ motive.
    

            “Whatever his story turns out to be, it’s not going to be simplistic, I don’t think – it’s going to be more complicated,” Puckett said. “You don’t want the simplistic version. You want every detail you can find.”

CNN_74,Biden faces fresh wave of Democratic defections as campaign tries to press forward,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/democratic-defections-joe-biden/index.html,2024-07-20 04:39:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden faced a new round of defections Friday from Democratic lawmakers publicly calling on him to leave the presidential race, even as his campaign sought to project a message that he isn’t going anywhere.
    

            One day after the Republican National Convention, new public calls for Biden to drop out from nearly a dozen lawmakers – including Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a close ally to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi – grew the list of congressional Democrats to 32 in all.
    

            Two House Democrats close to Pelosi, speaking on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity and rawness in the party right now, attributed Friday’s new statements – especially Lofgren’s letter to Biden – to the former speaker and her belief that it is critical for the president and his allies to understand the effort to push him aside is not going away after the Republican convention, despite the campaign’s efforts to quash it.
    

            The president is described by a source with direct knowledge as “seething” at Pelosi. This source said the sentiment only grew Friday when Lofgren, Pelosi’s longtime close lieutenant, released her letter urging Biden to step aside. CNN has reached out to Pelosi’s camp and the Biden campaign for comment on this reporting.
    

            It is a remarkable break between two powerful party elders and longtime allies in enacting key elements of the Biden agenda.
    

Aides to Vice President Kamala Harris inside and outside the campaign have also expressed unhappiness with Pelosi and her talk of a quick process to find a new candidate should Biden step aside.
    

            To them, “process” means trying to bypass the vice president in the event the president stepped aside. Harris, who has staunchly defended Biden publicly and tried to show unity, spoke with donors on a call Friday afternoon, which she was asked to do by the West Wing, according to campaign officials.
    

            Biden’s campaign hoped to force party unity Friday, releasing a statement from Biden saying he was looking forward to hitting the campaign trail next week after being sidelined with Covid-19.
    

            And Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon went on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Friday morning to say Biden was “absolutely” in the race.
    

            “Absolutely the president’s in this race. You heard him say that time and time again, and I think we saw on display last night exactly why,” she said. “Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.”
    

            Instead, there was a stream of new statements from House Democrats.
    

            The dynamic has played out repeatedly this week, as more and more Democrats have made public their desire for Biden to leave the race – in addition to reports of congressional Democratic leaders pushing Biden about his chances – even as the president repeatedly says he has no intention to drop out.
    

            A Democratic lawmaker told CNN that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his team are not discouraging members from continuing to speak out against Biden’s candidacy.
    

            The source said it was their impression that members were privately being encouraged to make such statements if they felt that way.
    

            For some of those who want Biden to step down, this source said that there is a fear that the public pile-on, which is expected to grow, is overkill and making Biden mad and potentially even more dug in.
    

            This source, who is in touch with the White House, said that while Biden is now more open to the conversation about potentially stepping aside, he “could go either way” and that the people he is listening to aren’t talking publicly.
    

            That concern didn’t stop more calls for Biden to leave the race on Friday.
    

            Lofgren, who served on the House January 6 committee, released a letter she sent to Biden urging him to step aside. “Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,” she wrote.
    

            Heinrich was the third senator to publicly call for Biden to leave the race, saying he believed it was “in the best interests of our country” for Biden to step aside.
    

            “By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation’s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,” Heinrich said in a statement.
    

            And four House Democrats – Reps. Jared Huffman and Mark Pocan; a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Chuy Garcia; and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Marc Veasey – released a joint statement Friday, using the same “pass the torch” rhetoric.
    

            “Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they said. “It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.”
    

            Lawmakers urging Biden to stay in the race have warned about the unchartered waters that the party would enter if Biden were to drop out. Biden’s campaign released a new memo Friday saying that there “is no plan for an alternative nominee.”
    

            DNC officials met by phone Friday for a convention rules committee meeting, where they shared few details on when a virtual roll call to renominate Biden.
    

            During the meeting, party leaders reiterated that voting wouldn’t start before August 1, but didn’t set a specific date. Instead, under the proposed plan, it will be up to party leadership to pick a date at a later time.
    

            The rules committee didn’t take any steps to approve the plan Friday but will meet again next week.

            The Federal Aviation Administration “is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the agency posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”
    

            Kurtz later told NBC, “We’re resolving and have resolved the issue.” 


            “As systems come back online, as they’re rebooted, they’re coming up and they’re working,” Kurtz said on the “Today” show. However, Kurtz said, it could be “some time” for certain systems that won’t just automatically recover.
    

            Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation.
    

            “Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. “We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”
    

            – Delta Air Lines “paused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,” it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.
    

            – JetBlue operations “remain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,” the airline said in an email to CNN. However, “Customers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.”
    

            – American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. “Earlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,” American said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”

            The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”
    

            And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, “local Social Security offices are closed to the public today,” the Social Security Administration’s website said.
    

            The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.
    

            In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration.
    

            “City services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,” the mayor’s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted.
    

            But in Alaska, many 911 and non-emergency call centers weren’t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored.
    

            In New Hampshire, some 911 services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire 911 said in a post.
    

            Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department’s computerized 911 dispatch center. “Our 911 center remains operational. If you need to call 911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,” Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its “systems have been restored.”
    

            In New York City, 911 services are operational, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.
    

            “FDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,” New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide 911 outages.
    

            “We’re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,” the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. “We’re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”
    

            In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems.
    

            North Carolina’s driver’s license and plate services are “unable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume “once the global outage has been repaired.”
    

            Georgia’s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable “Due to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.”
    

Residents in Texas will not be able to get IDs or driver licenses on Friday


            And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning.
    

            “The Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,” the agency said. “We apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.”
    

            The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is “absolutely insane” as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said.
    

             “It’s getting really hot in here,” Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations.

            His sentiments were echoed by would-be passengers in Atlanta, where airport officials told CNN they expected 300,000 passengers to pass through the world’s busiest airport.
    

            “Nobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system’s down, our system’s down,” New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN.
    

            She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. “I want to get home to my son,” Small said. But she doesn’t think she’ll be able to go home until Saturday.
    

            Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney was stuck in Atlanta with her toddler daughter, trying to get to Boston for a birthday party.
    

            “I’m just beyond frustrated,” Haney said. Spirit Airlines was using a manual check-in process, with “a person going up and down shouting ‘Boston here, flight number here,’” Haney said.
    

            “I have no idea when we are going to get called.”

CNN_76,How the world’s tech crashed all at once,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html,2024-07-20 04:41:00,us,"
            When computers and tech systems around the world went down Friday, snarling airports, closing Social Security offices and limiting jail operations, many people had one question: How on Earth could this happen in 2024?
    

            A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought.
    

            “[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,” Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. “While in reality, it’s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.”
    

            Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent — and some say misplaced — trust in that process was punctured on Friday.
    

            Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows — one of the most popular software programs in the world — crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows.
    

            CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts.
    

            “We trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we’ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,” Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN.
    

            “‘Winning’ in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all — consumers and companies alike — bear the costs,” Walther-Puri said.
    

            CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike.
    

            The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future.
    

            Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the “risks of consolidation” in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday.
    

            “We need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,” Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage.
    

            The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been.
    

            The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire.
    

            The CrowdStrike episode “demonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,” Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.

CNN_77,Blinken says Iran’s nuclear weapon breakout time is probably down to 1-2 weeks,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/blinken-nuclear-weapon-breakout-time/index.html,2024-07-20 05:08:00,politics,"
            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said that Iran’s breakout time – the amount of time needed to produce enough weapons grade material for a nuclear weapon – “is now probably one or two weeks” as Tehran has continued to develop its nuclear program.
    

            The assessment marks the shortest breakout time that US officials have ever referenced and comes as Iran has taken steps in recent months to boost its production of fissile material.
    

            “Where we are now is not in a good place,” the top US diplomat said at the Aspen Security Forum Friday.
    

            “Iran, because the nuclear agreement was thrown out, instead of being at least a year away from having the breakout capacity of producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon, is now probably one or two weeks away from doing that,” he said.
    

            “They haven’t produced a weapon itself, but that’s something of course that we track very, very carefully,” Blinken added.
    

            Blinken said the policy of the US is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that the administration would prefer to stop that from happening through diplomacy.
    

            Over a year ago a top US Defense Department official said that Iran could now produce “one bomb’s worth of fissile material” in “about 12 days.”
    

            The Biden administration engaged in more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal, from which the US withdrew in 2018 under the Trump administration.
    

            Those efforts collapsed in late 2022, as the US accused Iran of making “unreasonable” demands related to a probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN nuclear watchdog, into unexplained traces of uranium found at undisclosed Iranian sites. In the months that followed, the administration maintained that the Iran nuclear deal was “not on the agenda.”
    

            Iran’s new president has suggested they are open to engagement with the West. However, a senior State Department official told CNN that they no longer believe that there can be a return to the nuclear deal because Iran has engaged in too many escalatory acts in the years since talks broke down.
    

            “We’re in a very different world, a lot of time has elapsed, Iran has done a lot of things that make a return to JCPOA non-viable,” the official said.
    

            The State Department also said that there is no anticipation that the recent election in Iran will change the country’s behavior.
    

            “We have no expectations that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran’s direction or its policies,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier this month. “At the end of the day, it’s not the president that has the ultimate say over the future of Iran’s policy; it is the supreme leader, and of course we have seen the direction that he has chosen to take Iran in.  Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran’s nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome. But needless to say, we don’t have any expectations that that’s what’s likely to ensue.”

CNN_78,American Airlines flight attendants reach new contract deal,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/american-airlines-flight-attendants-union-new-contract/index.html,2024-07-20 05:35:00,us,"
            American Airlines’ 28,000 flight attendants have reached a tentative labor agreement with the company, their union said on Friday.
    

            The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents the flight attendants, said the deal addresses their concerns about compensation, work rules and retroactive pay. It did not offer more details.
    

            Reached after more than three years of negotiations, the tentative agreement will be sent to the union’s board for review. Once the board approves the deal, members will vote on ratifying it.
    

            “If approved, this agreement will put billions of additional dollars into compensation and work rules for our flight attendant workgroup,” said union head Julie Hedrick.
    

            The White House had been closely monitoring the talks in recent months and had been concerned about the impact of a work stoppage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su had earlier been involved in the talks.
    

            President Joe Biden on Friday praised the deal saying it “averts a strike that would have been devastating for the industry and consumers” and demonstrates “once again that collective bargaining benefits workers, companies, and our economy.”
    

            American said the contract will provide immediate financial and quality-of-life improvements for the employees.
    

            Last month, the airline offered flight attendants a new contract with an immediate 17% wage increase and higher profit sharing in 2024, which the union rejected.
    

            American’s flight attendants had authorized their union to call a strike if there wasn’t a deal. The union had proposed an immediate raise of about 33%, saying the flight attendants had not had a pay raise in over five years and endured a lot since the pandemic, notably unruly passengers.
    

            The contract negotiations started in January 2020 but paused at the height of the pandemic. Talks resumed in June 2021.

CNN_79,"Trump says he had ‘a very good phone call’ with Zelensky, discussed Russia-Ukraine war",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/donald-trump-zelensky-phone-call-2024/index.html,2024-07-20 07:46:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump said he “had a very good phone call” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday.
    

            The call between the two leaders, who have had a complicated relationship, marks their first conversation since Trump left the White House and comes the day after he formally accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president. It also comes amid concerns in Europe about what Trump’s policy toward the Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win the presidential election in November.
    

            “President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today. He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “He condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.”
    

            Trump continued, “I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.”
    

            Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the Ukraine war in a day, but it remains unclear how he would pursue peace.
    

            In last month’s CNN presidential debate, Trump said that Putin’s terms for an agreement – which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia – are “not acceptable.” But the former president and his allies have also criticized sending US military aid to Kyiv.
    

            But the former president and his allies have also criticized US military aid to Kyiv.
    

            Trump has long been critical of NATO defense spending. In February, the former president said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense, alarming many leaders in Washington and Europe.
    

            Trump and Zelensky also have their own history. Nearly five years ago, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a call ahead of the 2020 election. That “perfect phone call,” in Trump’s words, led to his first impeachment.
    

European diplomats have been preparing for Trump’s potential return to the White House, CNN previously reported, working to set up guard rails for NATO and trying to ensure lasting support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.
    

            Last week, when Zelensky was in the US, he said that “everyone is waiting for November,” including Putin. He also said that Biden and Trump are “very different” but both support democracy, which is why he claimed: “I think Putin will hate both of them.”

CNN_80,Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox pledges Trump his support after saying last week he wouldn’t vote for him,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/politics/utah-gov-spencer-cox-trump-support/index.html,2024-07-20 06:58:00,politics,"
            Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Friday pledged his support to former President Donald Trump in a notable shift after telling CNN last week he would not vote for Trump in November and hadn’t voted for him in 2016 or 2020.
    

            Cox told Trump in a letter he posted on X that God “had a hand in saving you,” after the attempt on the former president’s life at his Pennsylvania rally last weekend. “Your life was spared. Now, because of that miracle, you have the opportunity to do something that no other person on earth can do right now: unify and save our country,” he wrote.
    

            Cox’s vow to do his “best to help and support” Trump comes the day after the former president formally accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for a third consecutive election, further cementing his hold on and vision for the party. It marks a departure from his previous criticism of the former president.
    

            Cox told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins last week on “The Source” that he would not vote for either presidential candidate this year, noting Trump’s role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol as a concern. He had not voted for the top of the GOP ticket since 2012, Cox told Collins.
    

            In his letter, Cox said he was impressed with the statements Trump and former first lady Melania Trump made following the assassination attempt, saying that “there was strength in those words, and also humility. It was a side of you most of us have not seen, and it gave so many of us tremendous hope for the future of our country.”
    

            The governor noted differences between himself and his party’s nominee, writing: “Mr. President, I know we have some differences and you probably don’t like me much. And that’s OK. I get it. I’m not writing this letter looking for a position in your Cabinet or a role on your team. But I have loved so many of your policies and firmly believe that our country has suffered over the last four years due to a lack of leadership and is in desperate need of change.”
    

            Trump, he wrote, has “a chance to build a coalition of support that our country has not seen since Ronald Reagan.”
    

            “And you don’t have to compromise on a single conservative policy in order to do it. By treating President Biden with basic human dignity and respect and by emphasizing unity rather than hate, you will win this election by an historic margin and become one of our nation’s most transformational leaders,” Cox said.
    

            He continued, “By extending an olive branch to voters who are open to persuasion and ignoring the extremists, you can solidify a legacy as one of the most important presidents in our nation’s 250-year history. You can make your success, in leading our country to a new era of peace, unity, and prosperity, the greatest way to silence your critics.”

Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses


            The Federal Aviation Administration “is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the agency posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”
    

            CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”
    

            Kurtz promised customers “full transparency” on how the outage occurred. He said CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on CrowdStrike’s website.
    

            “We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the CEO told customers.
    

            But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.
    

            Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to “ascertain the threat” and find a solution to the global outage. He said he was on the call, which included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations.
    

            Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation.
    

            “Yesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. “We are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”
    

            – Delta Air Lines “paused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,” it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.
    

            – JetBlue operations “remain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,” the airline said in an email to CNN. However, “Customers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.”
    

            – American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. “Earlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,” American said in a statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.”

            In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges due to flight cancellations and delays. One center, Blood Assurance, told CNN that a planned shipment was postponed due to flight delays and cancellations.
    

            “We are asking community members to help through donation,” Blood Assurance said in an email. “We have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.”
    

            Elsewhere, New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast, has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood, said Andrea Cefarelli, the senior vice president of New York Blood Center Enterprises.
    

            Test tubes of blood sent to be tested before they’re distributed “are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,” Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. “There is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.”
    

            The American Red Cross has reassured patients and donors that they are not impacted by the global IT outage as they do not use CrowdStrike software.
    

            The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue “is significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.”
    

            And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, “local Social Security offices are closed to the public today,” the Social Security Administration’s website said.
    

            The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.
    

            In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration.
    

            “City services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,” the mayor’s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted.
    

            But in Alaska, many 911 and non-emergency call centers weren’t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored.
    

            In New Hampshire, some 911 services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire 911 said in a post.
    

            Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department’s computerized 911 dispatch center. “Our 911 center remains operational. If you need to call 911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,” Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its “systems have been restored.”
    

            In New York City, 911 services are operational, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.
    

            “FDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,” New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday.
    

            CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide 911 outages.
    

            “We’re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,” the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. “We’re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”
    

            In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems.
    

            North Carolina’s driver’s license and plate services are “unable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume “once the global outage has been repaired.”
    

            Georgia’s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable “Due to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.”
    

            And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning.
    

            Residents in Texas were not able to get IDs or driver’s licenses on Friday.
    

            “The Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,” the agency said. “We apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.”
    

            In New York City, arrival information for trains and buses went down for hours before being restored Friday afternoon, according to the MTA.
    

            The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is “absolutely insane” as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said.
    

             “It’s getting really hot in here,” Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations.

Which airports and airlines have been affected by outages?


            His sentiments were echoed by would-be passengers in Atlanta, where airport officials told CNN they expected 300,000 passengers to pass through the world’s busiest airport.
    

            “Nobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system’s down, our system’s down,” New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN.
    

            She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. “I want to get home to my son,” Small said. But she doesn’t think she’ll be able to go home until Saturday.
    

            Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney was stuck in Atlanta with her toddler daughter, trying to get to Boston for a birthday party.
    

            “I’m just beyond frustrated,” Haney said. Spirit Airlines was using a manual check-in process, with “a person going up and down shouting ‘Boston here, flight number here,’” Haney said.
    

            “I have no idea when we are going to get called.”
    

            Hotels are also feeling the impact of the outages: Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing outage.
    

            “We are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems,” the company, which has 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, said in a statement Friday afternoon. “We apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience.”

CNN_82,Churchill Downs lifts Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert’s suspension after he admits wrongdoing,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/churchill-downs-bob-baffert-suspension-lifted-spt/index.html,2024-07-20 07:40:00,world,"
            Churchill Downs lifted the suspension on Friday of thoroughbred trainer Bob Baffert after the Hall of Famer admitted to wrongdoing in the horse Medina Spirit’s failed drug test in the 2021 Kentucky Derby.
    

            Medina Spirit tested positive for a banned substance after initially being declared the winner of the Triple Crown race. The horse crossed the finish line first, but a blood sample revealed betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid sometimes used to relieve joint pain, was in the horse, CNN previously reported.
    

            The substance is not allowed on race day under Kentucky equine protocols.
    

            Baffert was initially given a two-year ban by Churchill Downs in 2021.
    

            Last July, before the suspension was lifted, Churchill Downs Incorporated, the organizer of the horse race and owner of the famed racetrack, extended Baffert’s suspension through the end of 2024.
    

            Baffert said at the time the drug was in a topical ointment used for a skin infection and Medina Spirit had not been injected with it.
    

            Baffert, who has trained six Derby winners, said in a post on X he is responsible for any substances found in his trained horses and has “paid a very steep price” with Medina Spirit’s disqualification and the three-year suspension.
    

            “I understand and appreciate that Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission took steps to enforce the rules that they believed were necessary to protect the safety and integrity of horse racing and the reputation of the Kentucky Derby,” Baffert said in the statement.
    

            “My family and I want to put this behind us and get back to doing what we love to do without any more distraction or negativity. I very much look forward to returning to Churchill Downs and getting back to the Winner’s Circle,” he said.

            Churchill Downs said it is “satisfied” Baffert took responsibility “for his actions, completed a substantial penalty and is committed to running in full compliance with the rules and regulations going forward.”
    

            In a statement Friday, Churchill Downs Incorporated CEO Bill Carstanjen welcomed Baffert back to its flagship racetrack and any other track owned by the company, which has racetracks across several states Louisiana, Kentucky and Virginia.
    

            “All parties agree that it is time to bring this chapter to a close and focus on the future,” Carstanjen said in the statement. “We wish him and his connections good luck in their future competitive endeavors.”
    

            Medina Spirit died in 2021 at the Santa Anita racetrack in Southern California after collapsing following a workout.
    

            The Kentucky Derby is scheduled to run on May 3, 2025.

CNN_83,Open Championship: ‘Hot headed’ Shane Lowry shrugs off cameraman clash to roar ahead but Rory McIlroy flames out,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/shane-lowry-cameraman-open-championship-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-20 06:02:00,world,"
            Rivals and cameramen, make way – Shane Lowry is coming through at the Open Championship.


            The Irishman lifted the red mist that momentarily descended upon him at Royal Troon in Scotland to wrestle control of the major, as his second round two-under 69 on Friday sent him into the weekend with a two shot lead.
    

            After opening with a bogey-free 66 on Thursday, 2019 champion Lowry had been motoring along smoothly at the summit before his advantage was derailed by a disastrous 30-minute saga on the notorious par-four 11th “Railway” hole.
    

            Having narrowly survived sending his tee shot onto the train tracks that run alongside the 488-yard hole, the world No. 33 went from frying pan to fire as his subsequent effort from the rough went careening left into the thick gorse across the other side of the fairway.
    

            A visibly disgruntled Lowry then gesticulated and pointed animatedly at a nearby cameraman, later admitting that he had – no pun intended – “lost his train of thought” after becoming “a little distracted” while stood over his shot.
    

            “There was a cameraman there, and he was walking up. I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,” Lowry told reporters on his return to the clubhouse.
    

            “As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, (it was) my own fault.”
    

            The drama continued when Lowry struck a “great” provisional shot – taken when a ball is presumed lost outside a penalty area or out of bounds – to within 12 feet of the hole, only for one eagle-eyed fan to subsequently find his original ball and void his provisional effort in the process.
    

            After a lengthy discussion with a rules official regarding where to take a drop from, the 37-year-old golfer eventually left with a double bogey – enough to erase his two-shot cushion, but “not a disaster”, he later reflected.
    

            If Lowry had lost his cool, he quickly found it in abundance. After rebounding with four steady pars, the Irishman signed off with his second birdie in three holes to restore the gap to English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend.
    

            As he seeks to turn back the clock to his dominant triumph at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland five years ago, Lowry has no intention of throttling the passion that helped him clinch his sole major to date.
    

            “I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot headed at times, but I really feel like that’s why I’ve had the career I’ve had,” Lowry, who has nine combined wins on the PGA Tour and European Tour, said.
    

            “If I go out there and try to be somebody I’m not, you’re just not going to be successful … [But] If I go out there and be myself, I feel like I can do very well. So allowing myself to do that, without getting in your own way.”
    

            It was an entirely contrasting day for Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, as the world No. 2 capitulated to become the highest profile casualty of a host of big names that failed to make the cut.
    

            The 35-year-old star had been out to exorcise the demons of his latest heartbreaking major near-miss at the US Open last month but found only more woe at Royal Troon, finishing 11-over par overall to fall well short of the top-70 players and ties that progressed to the weekend.
    

            Needing a fast start after a grueling first round 78, McIlroy’s hopes of making the cut were effectively extinguished by the end of the sixth hole after a nightmarish stretch. Having bogeyed the third, McIlroy triple bogeyed the following par-five hole before back-to-back bogeys.
    

            A solid back nine saw him go two-under par down the stretch but the damage was done, his closing 75 ensuring his wait for a fifth major will continue into an 11th year.
    

            “Once I made the eight on the 4th hole, that was it. 22 holes into the event and I’m thinking about where I’m going to go on vacation next week,” McIlroy admitted to reporters.
    

            “It was a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that, but at least I played okay and at least feel like, when the wind dropped, my game felt a little more comfortable and I hit some good shots.”
    

Tiger Woods will also be absent from the weekend, resigning him to a third consecutive missed major cut for just the second time in his career.
    

            The 48-year-old shot 79 and 77 to finish on 14-over par, the joint-highest 36-hole score he has ever recorded at a major, but insisted he still enjoyed the challenge.

            “I’ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,” Woods, who added he will “definitely” compete at next year’s Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, told reporters Friday.
    

            “Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn’t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.”
    

            Other big names that failed to survive the cut included last month’s US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, and last year’s US Open champion Wyndham Clark.
    

            With McIlroy, world No. 4 Ludvig Aberg and world No. 7 Viktor Hovland also missing out, only half of the world’s top-10 ranked players – Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Jon Rahm – will tee up Saturday.

NYT_1,Seattle Police Officer Fired Over ‘Cruel Comments’ About Pedestrian’s Death,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/seattle-police-jaahnavi-kandula-death.html,2024-07-19 12:26:00,,"A Seattle police officer was fired on Wednesday for his “cruel comments” and “callous laughter” about a pedestrian who was struck and killed by a police vehicle last year, the city’s interim police chief said.
The officer, Daniel Auderer, who is also a vice president of the city’s police union, unintentionally recorded himself laughing as he discussed the 2023 death of the woman, Jaahnavi Kandula, 23, soon after a speeding police S.U.V. driven by another Seattle officer hit her. She later died.
Mr. Auderer’s comments, which included saying that Ms. Kandula’s life had “limited value,” were recorded by his body camera.
The release of the video and his comments drew public outcry and protests in Seattle and India, where Ms. Kandula, who was a graduate student at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus, was born.Seattle’s interim police chief, Sue Rahr, explained her decision to terminate Officer Auderer in an email sent to the department on Wednesday evening. Chief Rahr said she took the unusual step of sharing the reasoning because the officer’s actions had far-reaching impact.
“Your comments here were so derogatory, hurtful and damaging to community trust that this case is unique, both in terms of the inhumanity of your comments and laughter and in the devastating impact they have had,” she said.

WaPo_1,"Mostly absent on GOP convention stage: Abortion, gun rights and Reagan",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/abortion-republican-national-convention/,2024-07-19 08:58:04.550728,,"MILWAUKEE — Eric Trump made somewhat dismissive comments this week about the Republican Party watering down its platform on abortion and same-sex marriage.“This country has real holes in the roof, and you’ve got to fix those holes, and you’ve got to stop worrying about the little spot on the wall in the basement,” former president Donald Trump’s middle son told NBC News.Imagine a big-name Republican likening abortion to a “spot on the wall” even four years ago. The backlash would have been swift. They might well have been excommunicated from the party.But abortion has indeed been little more than a spot on the wall at the 2024 Republican National Convention — or at least the version of it being conveyed to the American public. Despite years of rhetoric likening abortion to mass murder, the party hasn’t seen fit to say much of anything about it.And it’s got company in other fixtures of the party’s rhetoric.Through three nights at the GOP convention, the word “abortion” didn’t appear to have been uttered once onstage. That’s compared to 18 times in a single night of the 2020 convention, according to a transcript.While Trump has hailed the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade and allowing states to decide the issue — an outcome he often falsely claims virtually “everyone” desired — speakers aren’t even promoting that talking point. Roe hasn’t come up.There have been passing references to the issue. But that comes with a strong emphasis on “passing.”A Catholic archbishop opened Monday’s events with a prayer citing “the dignity of every life from conception to natural death.” But since then, nothing abortion-related has approached a real point of emphasis. Trump adviser Peter Navarro cited supposed government persecution of “pro-life activists,” while fellow Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway briefly cited “protecting life” in a list of priorities, not even pausing before mentioning the next one.Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), the GOP’s new vice-presidential nominee, are among the most antiabortion members of that chamber. Rubio has said he supports no abortion exceptions, while Vance has said he wants to make abortion illegal nationally, with some exceptions. But neither mentioned the issue.(Rubio did open by mentioning that the “life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind is in the hands of God,” but it was more a reference to the assassination attempt on Trump this past weekend.)Another, possibly even more surprising, absence has been any real emphasis or mention of gun rights, in the days since that assassination attempt.Vance in his speech earned roars from the crowd for mentioning how, upon his grandmother’s death two decades ago, “we found 19 loaded handguns” among her possessions. But despite that crowd-pleaser of a line, almost no speakers have approvingly mentioned guns or even merely protecting the Second Amendment.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis briefly claimed Tuesday night that Democrats want to “eliminate Second Amendment rights” — again, as part of a laundry list of issues — but that’s about it.When guns have come up, it has more often been in the context of crime, such as Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) mentioning how the “devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle” to shoot at Trump.A final conspicuous absence has been the name of the man who, before Trump at least, defined the Republican Party more than any other: Ronald Reagan.Reagan got three mentions Monday, the convention’s first night, but only one identifying the party with Reagan. Scott said, “We are the Republican Party of Frederick Douglass and of Abraham Lincoln, of Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.”Reagan wasn’t mentioned again until Thursday night, when the convention played a brief video featuring his voice.The video played up not Reagan’s muscular foreign policy or his iconic status in the party, but rather his famous question asking voters whether they were better off now than they were four years ago."
WaPo_2,These parents of a U.S. hostage in Gaza took their story to the RNC,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/gaza-hostage-family-rnc/,2024-07-19 08:43:04.550728,,"MILWAUKEE — Early Wednesday, Ronen and Orna Neutra woke up in a suburban hotel in an unfamiliar city and put on black T-shirts bearing their son’s photo.It was Day 285 since their son Omer was taken hostage in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, a blurry succession of weeks and months that sometimes felt like drowning.Shortly before 9 a.m., they stepped out of a car at a synagogue in a tree-lined neighborhood near Milwaukee and prepared themselves, once again, to tell their story.The city was the latest stop in a journey that had already taken them from their home on Long Island to Washington, Israel, Europe and Qatar seeking help. This would be one of the most surreal trips yet, culminating in a prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention.Ronen, 60, looked drawn. He had been up since 4 a.m. In his head, he had pored over the lines of the speech, writing and rewriting. How would the audience react, he wondered? Could they sidestep partisan politics while still pushing politicians to act? Would it all be too late for their son?Omer, 22, grew up in Plainview, N.Y. He is one of five Americans still believed to be held hostage in Gaza (the bodies of three other U.S. citizens who were killed on Oct. 7 have not been returned).There are about 120 hostages, living and dead, still in Gaza. For several weeks, a deal for a cease-fire and hostage release has appeared within reach.If the current negotiations fall apart, the Neutras are afraid there might not be another chance. “There is a great fear that we are getting to a place of no return,” Ronen said.So they push forward, speaking to anyone who might be able to support their cause. Inside the sanctuary of Congregation Shalom, the morning sunlight filtered down through a stained-glass window.Orna, 54, described Omer’s goofball charm, his love of cats, how he managed to be captain of his high school soccer, volleyball and basketball teams. He decided to spend a gap year in Israel, where his parents grew up and where he was also a citizen, before attending Binghamton University.When the pandemic forced him to come home in early 2020, he told his parents he was thinking about enlisting in the Israel Defense Forces. He went on to become a tank commander. On Oct. 7, he was the leader of a small outpost near the border with Gaza.The minute his parents heard about the attack, they began texting him. There was no reply. What little they know is this: There is a video of soldiers being pulled out of a burning tank. There’s someone pictured from the back who could be Omer. He seemed to be alive.After speaking to the congregation, Ronen and Orna retired to an empty chapel. They drank a cup of coffee and fielded messages from journalists and family and friends. An Israeli reporter wanted to know if they were meeting Donald Trump. Ronen laughed. There was no plan to meet him but it was theoretically possible.Writing their speech was a tug-of-war. There were things that the convention speechwriters working with the Neutras wanted them to say that they were not comfortable saying.“We’re probably going to be the only speech where there’s not going to be ‘Trump, Trump, Trump!’” said Ronen. “We’re not going to say that only he can bring them home.”The couple declined to discuss their own political affiliations, saying it’s irrelevant. “We’ll do anything and speak to anybody who can get our son home,” Orna said.When the Neutras speak publicly, they don’t talk about the ferocity of Israel’s counterattack, which has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians and left nearly 90,000 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Swaths of the territory have been pulverized and international experts have warned of looming famine.What’s happening in Gaza is “horrible,” Orna said, but Hamas could end it by releasing the hostages. Ronen echoed that sentiment: Hamas is “not only holding hostage our son, they’re also holding hostage the people of Gaza.”They try not to wade into U.S. or Israeli politics, but their frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is palpable. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has always been responsive, the Neutras said, and they’ve met with senior officials from the president on down.From Congregation Shalom they piled into a black Suburban and headed to Fiserv Forum, the convention venue, for a rehearsal of their speech.Accompanying them was Liz Hirsh Naftali, whose grandniece Abigail Edan, 4, was taken hostage on Oct. 7 after her parents were killed. Abigail was freed in the previous deal in November, when hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.Naftali is an investor who interviews politicians on her podcast and a former Democratic fundraiser. After Oct. 7, Naftali threw herself into hostage advocacy. She forged a bond with Penny Nance, chief executive of Concerned Women for America, a conservative evangelical group.“We’re people who are very different, who maybe don’t agree on anything else, but we love each other,” said Naftali. It was Nance who reached out to the Trump campaign about a possible speaking slot at the convention. “I just wanted to help,” Nance said.At Fiserv Forum, the Neutras were whisked into an elevator and along a long red carpeted hallway into a private lounge reserved for speakers. There was a giant poster of the former president at the entrance. Everyone entering was encouraged to sign it.Orna picked up a black marker and carefully wrote, “Bring our hostages home!” then, above it, “Best of luck.” (The good wishes, she specified later, were for the return of the hostages.)The Neutras walked past a door marked “Makeup City” and entered a small rehearsal room. It was set up with a teleprompter and microphone. They ran through the speech three times, making slight adjustments to the text.Paul Miner, a speech coach, encouraged them to make any changes now. When people improvise at the last minute, Miner warned, “that’s when things go cattywampus.” He asked them what they would use to sign off. God bless America? A simple thank you? The Neutras weren’t sure.“Say what’s in your heart,” Miner said.As they drove to their next event — a luncheon organized by the Republican Jewish Coalition — Ronen said he felt good about the rehearsal. Asked for her thoughts, Orna demurred. “You don’t understand,” she said. One way of dealing with the situation they’re in is “not asking yourself how you’re feeling.” It’s more important just to keep moving.Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), dressed in a bright red suit, stopped to hug Ronen as she left the luncheon. “Always praying,” she said. They talk about the need for a cease-fire deal. She nodded: “This can’t drag on.”At an event organized by the American Jewish Committee at the Milwaukee Athletic Club, the couple entered a room of people mingling near platters of crudités and Wisconsin cheese. Orna retreated to a wall, Ronen to a window. The organizer apologized and took them to another room. They’re exhausted and can’t do small talk, Orna explained.Later, they addressed the assembled guests gathered in a ballroom under crystal chandeliers. The last time she heard her son’s voice, Orna said, was the night before the attack. She still hears it in her head. He was calm. We’ll talk tomorrow, he said. We love you, she replied.Ronen and Orna met when they were seated next to each other on a flight from Tel Aviv to Paris. In 1999, they moved to New York, and Omer was born two years later. They started a scientific equipment company, which they’ve barely run since October.By 6:30 p.m., they had returned to Fiserv Forum after another speaking event and a live interview with NBC News. Ronen and Orna both looked drained. They sat at a high table in the speaker’s lounge, drinking mint tea and trying to gather their thoughts. Their younger son would watch their speech at home on Long Island.Television screens around the room showed the convention proceedings. Before the Neutras were scheduled to speak, there was a video featuring Gold Star families whose loved ones were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Kabul.The speaker’s lounge went silent as they recounted their stories. The relatives serving in harm’s way, the confused reports of a deadly attack, the frantic texts with no answer. For the Neutras, it was excruciatingly familiar.Orna took a long shaky breath. It was time to go onstage.Before the Neutras could begin to speak, the crowd started to chant. “Bring them home! Bring them home! Bring them home!” The couple pressed their hands to their chests in acknowledgment. When Orna recited the words of Psalm 23, some in the audience joined along.Ronen reminded the crowd that more than 40 American citizens were among the 1,200 people killed in Israel on Oct. 7. He said Trump — who was seated in a raised section to Ronen’s left — spoke with them after the attack and stands with the American hostages. “God bless Israel, and God bless America,” Ronen said in closing.They seemed both dazed and relieved that it was over. They felt uplifted by the crowd’s response. Ronen personally thanked some of the volunteers who helped them prepare. “Good people,” he said. “They care.”Within minutes, they were headed back to their hotel, 11 miles away.

Until now.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/18/musket-ball-revolutionary-war-america/,2024-07-19 08:35:04.550728,,"Jarrad Fuoss was digging in the cold ground of a Massachusetts park in winter 2023, not expecting he or his fellow archaeologists would find anything.Then he heard someone yell: “You’re never going to believe what I got!”Fuoss, a federal park ranger at Minute Man National Historical Park and a trained archaeologist, quickly crossed the roughly 25 yards to watch as dirt was brushed off the discovery: It was a musket ball — a scratched piece of lead that is part of an incredible story.“It sends shivers down your spine,” Fuoss said. “The last time somebody touched it they were shoving it down the muzzle of a musket on April 19, 1775.”That was the day 2½ centuries ago when gunfire sparked the American Revolution in what writer Ralph Waldo Emerson dubbed the “shot heard round the world.” And the archaeologists were standing in between Lexington and Concord on the exact spot historians believe the first shot was fired.The team of National Park Service archaeologists ultimately dug up four more pieces of ammunition. Through scientific analysis, the Park Service determined the balls were fired from muskets by colonial militiamen. That means they can be considered among the first hunks of metal that began America’s bloody history, officials at Minute Man park said.The musket balls briefly went on display to the public last week, becoming a crowd favorite and lighting up the eyes of many kids, said Nikki Walsh, museum curator at Minute Man. They’re now back in the archives, with hopes of having them on permanent display before 2026.“Even if you aren’t into history, this was a moment in time that’s not only a historic moment, but it sets the tone for our new country and this new government and everything that’s happened in the last 249 years,” she said.The museum has 260,000 artifacts in its collection, she said. But even with so many relics preserved, only 35 other musket balls have been found in the park.Walsh said she was not working the day of the discovery but received an all-caps text from Fuoss: “WE FOUND MUSKET BALLS”The crew started its 2023 dig to make sure something like those musket balls wasn’t in the ground: The park received a $27 million grant to upgrade its infrastructure ahead of 2026, the 250th anniversary of the nation’s founding. Park staff planned to do drainage work in the area where the discovery was made and are required to check for anything of historical importance before the project can proceed.Fuoss said they thought finding anything would be unlikely because the area where they were digging was turned into a park in the early 19th century and gets a lot of foot traffic.No one was holding their breath, but, Fuoss said: “There’s always that little hope there.”The archaeologists quickly realized what they had, and all of them had the same question: What was the caliber? It could help answer the question of which side had fired the shot. In 1775, the ragtag militiamen brought whatever weapons they had, said Fuoss, a historic weapons specialist. But the British soldiers had standardized weapons that shot .69-caliber musket balls.So, if the musket balls were outside that range, that meant they were probably fired by the militiamen.A crew member measured them and confirmed they were outside that range.But how do they know they weren’t fired during a hunting trip? Well, Fuoss said, the area at that time had been deforested, and a musket ball would only have been used to hunt larger game. There was no large game to hunt at the time with all the trees gone.He added that so many musket balls so closely grouped together is “pretty outrageous if not related to military action.” That is also the exact spot, from accounts of the day, where the British soldiers lined up.Walsh said experts tried to rule out everything. There was only one battle in that spot, she said, and the militia didn’t hold target practice in an open farm field.“When you start putting all those things in context, it becomes very clear these were fired during the battle itself,” Fuoss said.The gunfire that day led to an eight-hour battle that spanned 16 miles, involving 4,000 militiamen. Fuoss said 273 British soldiers were either killed, wounded or captured — the number was about 96 for the militia. It was, Fuoss said, “an astronomical number for a battle of this time period.”“And,” he added, “that’s just Day 1.”"

WaPo_5,Hulk Hogan to make a surprising political debut at the RNC,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/07/18/hulk-hogan-trump-rnc/,2024-07-19 08:00:04.550728,,"Hulk Hogan — a crossover superstar of professional wrestling’s 1980s golden era — is scheduled to speak Thursday at the closing night of the Republican National Convention, according to people familiar with the lineup.But on the eve of his biggest foray into the political arena, the muscled and mustachioed brawler turned to social media with a special message for the fans that had nothing to do with the campaign.“You know something? Real American Beer is taking Missouri by storm, and the Ozarks is no different!,” the 70-year-old star roared into the camera Wednesday, plugging his weekend stops at two waterfront bars to promote his new branded line of canned lager. “Rock-and-roll and Hulk Hogan’s Real American Beer go together!”In the past, Hogan has endorsed Barack Obama and teased that he himself might run for president. But until now, he has not widely publicized his thoughts about the 2024 election.And his biggest political role to date came in the court battle that destroyed the popular gossip blog Gawker, which came to stand as something of a proxy battle for a larger culture war.Donald Trump has a long showbiz connection to professional wrestling, from his early sponsorship of WrestleMania events to his scripted participation in fight storylines — shoving WWE impresario Vince MacMahon backward over a table in one routine and allowing “Stone Cold” Steve Austin to fling him to the mat in another. Dana White, the president and chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship and another longtime Trump associate, is also scheduled to speak Thursday.But other than the occasional shout out, Hulk Hogan — real name, Terry Bollea — never conspicuously intersected with those storylines, nor with Trump’s political rise.This is @HulkHogan's promo before WrestleMania 4 in 1988, which was held at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.""Thank God Donald Trump is a Hulkamaniac!"" pic.twitter.com/mgS7arxUGeDuring his 1980s and ’90s heyday, though, the wrestler at least flirted with political symbolism.Styling himself as an underdog American hero and paragon of patriotism, Hogan consistently battled caricatured foreign adversaries — the Iron Sheik, Andre the Giant, Killer Khan — who were cast as villains in the fictional wrestling world.He walked to the ring accompanied by the entrance song “Real American,” often wearing red-white-and-blue bandannas or carrying an American flag.At other times, his foils were wealthy snobs — a popular target for wrestling’s working-class fans — like the “Million Dollar Man” Ted DiBiase, who wore a glittery and gold-studded championship belt and tried to “buy” the WWE’s world title away from Hogan.His popularity foreshadowed the future crossover success of wrestlers-turned-movie stars like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and John Cena. Hogan went mainstream — hosting “Saturday Night Live,” landing on the cover of Wheaties boxes and taking roles in films like “Rocky III” and “Suburban Commando,” where he played a super-galactic hero living in the suburbs.His similarly charismatic wrestling colleague Jesse Ventura crossed all the way over into real-life American politics, eventually becoming the one-term governor of Minnesota.But Hogan’s spotlight faded as he continued to put himself up against younger talent and lose.In 2012, Gawker published a two-minute clip of a leaked sex tape from 2006, showing Hogan in bed with Heather Clem, the wife of his best friend, radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge. Hogan later said that he had his friend’s blessing to have sex with his wife.But the wrestler sued Gawker in 2013 for invasion of privacy, among other claims, saying he had not given his consent to be recorded.Despite initial rulings from federal judges that the publication was newsworthy and protected — Gawker argued that Hogan had made his sex life central to his public persona — the lawsuit in 2016 came before a Florida jury, which delivered a $140 million verdict in Hogan’s favor.A settlement later brought the sum down to $31 million, but Gawker filed for bankruptcy in June 2016. Days before, tech billionaire Peter Thiel went public to acknowledge that he had quietly funded Hogan’s litigation to the tune of $10 million as something of a personal vendetta.For years, the PayPal founder had carried a grudge against Gawker, after sister site Valleywag had reported on the fact that he was gay — an open secret at the time in venture capital circles.Valleywag, though, had also provided skeptical coverage of tech companies and their founders — a rising class of powerful businessmen such as Thiel, who would go on to endorse Trump’s 2016 campaign and mentor Trump’s 2024 running mate, J.D. Vance. And so the case took on added dimensions as a skirmish in a larger backlash by conservatives against media outlets they deemed hostile.1/5The case took its toll on Hogan. Audio recordings revealed during the litigation captured him uttering racist insults, which prompted WWE to terminate his contract.But just three years later, in 2018, he was welcomed back into the WWE universe and reinstated into the WWE Hall of Fame. Since then he has shown up on occasional television shows and major events. His career was highlighted by WWE in January of this year in a 40th anniversary special video.Hogan’s political views have shifted as quickly as a wrestling gimmick. He endorsed Barack Obama ahead of the 2008 election, but changed his tune for 2012 — which might have been related to Obama using Hogan’s “Real American” song as a gag riffing on the conspiracy theories about the former president’s birthplace, an early Trump talking point.In 2015, Hogan made the case that he should be Trump’s running mate. But just as recently as a few weeks ago he suggested he’d run for president himself.“We need somebody in there that’s got some common sense,” he told Fox News in June.In an October 2020 Instagram post, he gave perhaps his strongest endorsement until now.“All the Hulkmaniacs, make sure you go vote. You know what I’m saying?” he said. “Otherwise I might just have to run for president if we don’t straighten this crap out.”"
WaPo_6,RNC 2024 live updates: Trump to give first speech since rally shooting,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/18/rnc-republican-national-convention-trump-speech-biden-election/,2024-07-19 08:58:04.550728,,"Former president Donald Trump started his keynote address at the Republican convention with a description of the assassination attempt at his rally Saturday. He said this would be the only time he would recount that day’s events because it was too painful to recount. The former president touched on many of his usual stump-speech themes — saying the world was teetering on the brink of World War III and, without evidence, accused opponents of “cheating on elections.” He also promised to finish the campaign strong. “Otherwise, we’ll blow it,” Trump added. “And we can’t let that happen.”"
WaPo_7,"Bernice Johnson Reagon, singer and civil rights activist, dies at 81",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/18/bernice-johnson-reagon-dead/,2024-07-19 09:47:03.844472,,"Bernice Johnson Reagon, a powerful voice for social justice who co-founded the Freedom Singers, a touring group that raised money and morale for the civil rights movement, and later led the ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock, safeguarding Black vocal traditions while imaginatively blending jazz, blues, work songs and spirituals, died July 16 at a hospital in Washington. She was 81.Her daughter, the singer and musician Toshi Reagon, confirmed the death but did not give a specific cause.Dr. Reagon spent decades working at the intersection of music and activism, promoting Black history and culture as a scholar, performer, composer and producer. She received a PhD in history from Howard University, taught as a professor at American University, worked as a curator at the Smithsonian Institution and explored the development of African American sacred music through books and radio programs, including a Peabody-winning NPR show, “Wade in the Water,” that she created and hosted in 1994.“My history was wrapped carefully for me by my fore-parents in the songs of the church, the work fields, and the blues,” she wrote in the liner notes to her 1965 solo album “Folk Songs: The South,” describing a moment of self-revelation. “Ever since this discovery I’ve been trying to find myself, using the first music I’ve ever known as a basic foundation for my search for truth.”The daughter of a Baptist minister, Dr. Reagon came of age while protesting racial segregation in her hometown of Albany, Ga., a white-supremacist stronghold that captured the attention of organizers including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. She was only 19, a student at Albany State College, when the Albany movement began in November 1961, but she soon gained a reputation as a gifted organizer and performer, going to jail for her activism and singing spirituals and protest songs that fortified her colleagues in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC.Asked to lead the group in song at one of the movement’s first mass meetings, she started in on a well-known spiritual — “Over my head, I see trouble in the air” — before deciding that the lyrics weren’t right for the occasion. On an impulse, she swapped “trouble” for “freedom.”“By the second line,” she recalled, “everyone was singing.”Even seasoned activists found themselves rejuvenated by the music.“I remember seeing you lift your beautiful black head, stand squarely on your feet, your lips trembling as the melodious words ‘Over my head, I see freedom in the air’ came forth with an urgency and a pain that brought out a sense of intense renewal and commitment of liberation,” SNCC organizer James Forman wrote in a 1972 memoir, “The Making of Black Revolutionaries.”“Your pain and sorrow were the anguish of the people,” he added, “and you comforted all of us.”While the Albany movement failed to desegregate the city’s public spaces, it served as a proving ground for civil rights tactics and strategies, and further illustrated the power of protest songs. In late 1962, Dr. Reagon — then known as Bernice Johnson — joined three other musician-activists in forming the Freedom Singers, a choral group that hit the road in a Buick station wagon, performing in support of SNCC and the movement at churches, concert halls, college campuses and coffee houses.The original lineup included Rutha Mae Harris, Charles Neblett and Cordell Reagon, a tenor who had joined the civil rights struggle in Nashville and married Dr. Reagon in 1963. The group played at the Newport Folk Festival and the March on Washington that year, and also joined performers Harry Belafonte and Thelonious Monk in a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall. Toshi Seeger, the wife of folk singer Pete Seeger, helped the ensemble book shows; she also became the godmother and namesake of Dr. Reagon’s daughter.“People were always asking, ‘We need help: Can the Freedom Singers come to Nashville?’ ‘Can they come to Atlanta?’ ‘Can they come to a SNCC meeting in McComb, Mississippi?’ ” said author and civil rights historian Taylor Branch, who described Dr. Reagon as “the organizing force” of the group.“Music was vital,” he added in a phone interview. “It’s the language of pure emotion, and people can sing themselves into doing things they’d be afraid to do otherwise.”Dr. Reagon, a contralto, likened the Freedom Singers to “a singing newspaper,” spreading the word about the civil rights movement through narratives that she and the other vocalists sprinkled around songs like “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round” (“Ain’t gonna let segregation, Lordy, turn me ’round”) and “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize” (“Paul and Silas bound in jail, had no money for to go their bail”).Although the original lineup came apart after a couple years, Dr. Reagon continued to sing, forming an Atlanta a cappella group called the Harambee Singers before launching Sweet Honey in the Rock, an all-female, all-Black ensemble that mixed popular genres with traditional music, receiving three Grammy nominations and touring around the world.Formed in 1973, when Dr. Reagon was working as the vocal director for the D.C. Black Repertory Company, the group took its name from a song title that also doubled as a metaphor, suggesting the strength and sweetness of Black women in general and the group’s members in particular. Their music addressed Black history and political oppression, in a genre-blending format that was “less eclectic than electric, a blend of pain and joy and affirmation,” wrote Washington Post journalist Richard Harrington.For Dr. Reagon, who retired as the group’s director in 2004, the ensemble’s music reflected a realization she had during her teenage performances at mass meetings. Singing in churches, living rooms and other informal settings, she discovered “culture to be not luxury, not leisure, not entertainment,” she said, “but the lifeblood of a community.”The third of eight children, Bernice Johnson was born near Albany on Oct. 4, 1942. Her father was a circuit preacher and self-taught carpenter who built the family’s rural home. Her mother looked after the family and “kept us moving to a higher level,” Dr. Reagon told The Post in 1987. “She could always see that we could operate in a different world with more opportunities. She mortgaged her life to make sure we had a chance to do that.”While studying music at Albany State College, now a university, Dr. Reagon became a leader of the local junior chapter of the NAACP. Her subsequent activism, culminating in her arrest in 1961, led the college to suspend her.“It also brought about my first real decision for myself,” she recalled, “and I found that I had the capacity to think for myself. I began to wonder who I was, what I was doing here, what really was behind the fear and atrocities suffered by the Negro.” She found answers after enrolling at Spelman College in Atlanta and turning to the spirituals that she had learned as a child in the Baptist Church.Dr. Reagon dropped out of Spelman to tour with the Freedom Singers, later returning to finish her bachelor’s degree, in history, in 1970. She moved to Washington the next year and received her PhD from Howard in 1975.By then she was working at the Smithsonian, where she developed a program on the African diaspora for the Folklife Festival, joined the National Museum of American History as a curator and eventually served on the scholarly advisory committee of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. She received a MacArthur “genius” grant in 1989 and was honored by President Bill Clinton with the Charles Frankel Prize for the humanities in 1995.Her marriage to Cordell Reagon ended in divorce in 1967. In addition to her daughter, who collaborated with her on musical projects that included an opera adaptation of “Parable of the Sower,” the postapocalyptic novel by Octavia E. Butler, survivors include Dr. Reagon’s partner of about three decades, Adisa Douglas; a son, Kwan Reagon; two brothers; two sisters; and a granddaughter.Performing solo or with Sweet Honey, Dr. Reagon often called on audiences to join her in singing, as when she performed the gospel song “Lord, Remember Me” at the opening of her Barnard College commencement address in 2001.In her speech, she urged graduates to fight sexism — “I come burdened,” she announced, “because we still live in a culture where one of the first things a female human being learns is to be afraid because they are female” — and to do something worth remembering, in a nod to the song with which she began.“If you live your life in such a way that your actions transform the space you operate in,” she said, “that’s a way of asking to be remembered.”"
WaPo_8,Corporate donors swarm GOP convention: ‘It’s like a cocktail party’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/trump-corporations-republican-convention-donors/,2024-07-19 09:11:03.844472,,"Much of corporate America has flocked to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week, packing luxury suites high above the arena, cutting checks, sponsoring late-night parties and mingling with Republican politicians as well as former and current Trump advisers over happy hours and lunches.The revelry is a remarkable shift from several years ago, when many corporate donors treated Trump as a pariah after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and decried his efforts to overturn the election. Companies faced backlash from an angry workforce if they embraced the former president or supported his nascent effort to return to the White House. In the Republican presidential primary, many of the country’s top donors wrote big checks for Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, eschewing Trump.But now that Trump is the Republican standard-bearer, more than 300 executives and lobbyists are attending the convention as guests of his campaign. That total includes more than a dozen oil and gas CEOs or lobbyists who have fueled the Trump campaign with massive checks. Firms such as Lockheed Martin, Comcast, Pepsi, Aflac and other Fortune 500 companies have executives in attendance, according to Trump campaign officials who, like other people interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose behind-the-scenes details about the convention.Construction firms, waste management companies, mortgage bankers, trade associations, sugar executives, Realtors, home builders, banks, hotel chains, asphalt companies and others are represented in Milwaukee. “They want to get to know the people who would be in charge of another term,” a lobbyist who represents several of the firms said.High above the arena floor, on a long, closed-to-the-public concourse lined with wood-paneled luxury suites, the mood has been exuberant. For three nights, the GOP’s top leaders have circulated from box to box along the concourse, watching the action on in-suite televisions and drinking, eating and building relationships with the nation’s wealthiest donors.“Every night, it’s like a cocktail party,” one person who has attended all three nights said of the concourse. “It’s donors, lobbyists, senators, members of Congress and governors standing outside talking and drinking.”Trump has not circulated in the suites, but vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) has a suite, according to campaign advisers.Lobbyists from more than a dozen prominent firms have attended the convention as guests of the Trump campaign’s host committee. To get in the boxes, donors have to have written large checks or have promised large checks.Top executives in the cryptocurrency industry are also in the boxes, people familiar with the matter said, as they seek to get Trump to take a more favorable approach to the industry than Biden. Trump has embraced cryptocurrency in recent months, and the official Republican Party platform praised the industry.Multiple donors said they’ve been surprised by how many tech executives have circulated among the luxury suites. Many of the tech executives have been there to support Vance and say a Trump administration will treat their companies better than the Biden administration has.The boxes have gotten so loud at times that donors have shushed each other. Seizing the opportunity, lawmakers, governors and others have created specialty boxes in hidden corners of the arena where donors can gather in quieter, more private settings.Donors have been served nacho chips with salsa and guacamole, pigs in blankets, sliders, popcorn, peanuts, wine and beer, and enjoyed a make-your-own-drink bar.One longtime donor who has attended multiple conventions recalled looking around Wednesday evening and seeing so many elected officials that he was taken aback. At least 30 U.S. senators have visited the boxes, along with the top leadership of the Trump campaign, more than a dozen governors and leadership of the U.S. House, people in the boxes said.“The thing that made my eye pop a little bit is the high concentration of Trump officials and elected officials in such a small space. It’s just been really remarkable,” the donor said.The convention has raised a record $85 million from corporate America, according to Reince Priebus, chairman of the RNC host committee, and corporations have sponsored boozy parties across town.Priebus, who has the best suite, entertains nightly and issues some of the most sought-after invites, people at the convention said.“Companies across Milwaukee, the state of Wisconsin and the country have been very generous to the Milwaukee Host Committee and we are beyond grateful,” Priebus said.Conventions have always been a favored spot for corporations and lobbyists to mingle, meet with influential politicians, curry favor with political campaigns and witness politics up close. On the Democratic side, some of the country’s top unions and billionaires also have special access to politicians during the convention. This year’s Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago next month.But corporations and lobbyists’ presence at the Republican National Convention this year is notable because it shows that corporate America has returned to Trump — even as some of the speakers at the convention, including the head of the Teamsters union, have decried corporations and their influence.Some donors groaned audibly during a speech delivered by the Teamsters president, one donor said. But GOP donors have largely been optimistic about the party’s chances and pleased with the convention.To be sure, some major donors, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, have not shown up to the luxury suites.Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak, who is close to donors and attending the convention, said corporate America has several reasons to return to the GOP fold.“The big reason is the tax cuts. Is Biden going to extend the tax cuts? The answer is no,” Mackowiak said. “Trump is going to do it. They’re going to put it on steroids.”As he asks for money, Trump has repeatedly promised major donors that he will cut their taxes — and said Biden will raise them.One of the biggest donors at the convention is Harold Hamm, an oil billionaire from Oklahoma who is friends with the former president. Trump has asked the oil industry to bring in $1 billion, and lobbyists from multiple oil companies are attending the event. Trump has promised in fundraisers to enact policies that oil executives want.But the main reason many executives have given, according to many donors, is they believe Trump will be back in office — or at least are concerned enough to hedge their bets. “Money wants to be with the winner,” Mackowiak said.Business executives are not necessarily pro-Trump but are furious with Gary Gensler, Lina Khan and other Biden administration officials and how they have approached regulations, one prominent business executive who attended the convention said.“A lot of people say, at this point, ‘We’ll take the mean tweets,’” said the person, who is not a Trump fan.On the Democratic side, donors are increasingly less likely to want to attend the convention if Biden is the nominee, several donors said. “Money is drying up,” a prominent Democrat involved in the Biden operation said.“Almost everyone I talk to is despondent about the situation on the Democratic side,” said Kathy Wylde, who leads the Partnership for New York City, a major business group. “It’s not just Biden’s weak performance but equally the fact that Americans are resorting to violence, both physical and rhetorical, to resolve their dissatisfaction with the state of affairs. Business abhors political instability, which seems to have overtaken the country.”"
WaPo_9,Secret Service seeks help for next Trump rally as GOP fumes at director,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/secret-service-trump-rally-security-michigan/,2024-07-19 09:00:03.844472,,"MILWAUKEE — A top adviser to Donald Trump called for the Secret Service director’s resignation on Thursday, as the agency took steps to bolster security for the Republican nominee’s next rally on Saturday.Senior adviser Chris LaCivita demanded the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle in remarks hosted by Politico, after she was recorded fleeing angry questions from Republican senators here on Wednesday. Lawmakers were outraged by a briefing where they said she failed to address urgent questions about how the agency allowed a 20-year-old man with an AR-style rifle to take shots at Trump from an unsecured rooftop bordering his rally at a fairgrounds in Butler, Pa., on Saturday.“There are not enough facts,” LaCivita said. “Clearly, the director has no intention of saying s---.”Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said LaCivita was expressing a personal opinion and hasn’t discussed the question with the former president.Tensions have been mounting in recent days between Trump aides and Secret Service leadership, people familiar with the matter have said.In addition to outrage over the lapses at last weekend’s rally, Trump aides were angered when officials revealed Tuesday that Trump had been briefed on an unspecified threat by Iran, unrelated to the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. They said the campaign had been warned to expect stepped-up security due to that threat against the former president but had not been informed of the threat related to Iran, a hostile foreign power.On Monday, Cheatle met with senior Trump campaign aides in a hotel suite in Milwaukee to brief them on the investigation into the rally shooting, but the meeting was acrimonious at times, people familiar with the matter said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting. The RNC has clashed with the Secret Service this week over security and logistics, they said.A spokesman for the Secret Service did not respond to questions about tensions with Trump aides.Trump is set to return to the campaign trail on Saturday with a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., his first since the attempted assassination and his first joint campaign event with Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), his running mate. After the shooting, the event was moved to an indoor arena that is easier to secure than open air, said people familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. They said the campaign is not expecting to do outdoor rallies again for the foreseeable future.For this Saturday, the Secret Service is asking for additional help from local law enforcement, some local officials said.Kent County Undersheriff Bryan Muir said at a board of commissioners meeting that the sheriff’s office received a “last-minute request” for assistance and planned to dispatch 50 to 60 officers to the rally. A spokeswoman specified that the request came from the Secret Service. A spokesman for the Grand Rapids Police Department said the department is also working with federal agencies to plan Saturday’s event.The Trump campaign declined to comment on security and referred questions to the Secret Service, which also declined to comment on rally preparations, citing the need to protect operations.Kent County commissioner Walter Bujak, a Republican, said that he plans to attend the Trump rally in Grand Rapids and that he expects the security staffing will be “unbelievable.”“They will be on heightened security obviously,” Bujak said. “They’re going to dot the i’s and cross the t’s for this one.”Federal investigators are still urgently combing through the security failures at last Saturday’s rally that led to the wounding of the former president, the death of one attendee and two other critical injuries. The FBI said this week it is investigating the assassination attempt as “potential domestic terrorism.” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week the nation is in a “heightened” threat environment.Investigators have not identified a motive or indicated they have any evidence pointing to an ideological connection to the assassination attempt.Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are also demanding answers from FBI Director Christopher A. Wray after the lawmakers said they were contacted by whistleblowers claiming the Secret Service was under-resourced for the Pennsylvania rally because of last week’s NATO summit in Washington.A spokesman for the Secret Service declined to comment on the letter, citing ongoing investigations into the shooting, and said the agency will cooperate with congressional reviews, as well as a probe that has been launched by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general.On Monday, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security put out a joint intelligence bulletin, first reported by Politico, warning about possible attacks.“The FBI and DHS remain concerned about the potential for follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence following this attack, particularly given that individuals in some online communities have threatened, encouraged, or referenced acts of violence in response to the attempted assassination,” the bulletin said.Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security think tank and a member of Mayorkas’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, said she would expect the Secret Service to surge resources and people to events such as the Grand Rapids rally to safeguard politicians and the public. She said she also would expect “more hands-on management by higher levels to make sure plans are in place.”The Michigan State Police referred questions to the Secret Service. “They are the lead agency for these events and we only assist,” spokesperson Kim Vetter said in an email Wednesday.Another Kent County commissioner, Iván Diaz, a Democrat who represents parts of Grand Rapids, said he was not informed of any Secret Service preparations for the rally. He said that in February, Vice President Harris visited a church near the Van Andel Arena, where the rally will be held, without incident.Diaz said he planned to join protests outside the arena in hopes that Americans would pick other candidates to represent them.“The more that we have these candidates who are demonizing people, who are making it seem like political opponents are enemies to be destroyed, the more likely it is that we’ll have political violence,” he said.At the White House this week, Mayorkas sought to reassure the public that the Secret Service is at high capacity, even with questions swirling around the agency.“I have 100 percent confidence in the United States Secret Service,” he said Monday. “And what you saw on stage on Saturday with respect to individuals putting their own lives at risk for the protection of another is exactly what the American public should see every single day. It is what I indeed do.”After the shooting, he said, the service boosted security for Biden, Trump and Vice President Harris, and granted Secret Service protection to Vance as well as independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Mayorkas said officials added personnel and technology to safeguard the officials but declined to provide details because they involve “sensitive tactics and procedures.” He emphasized that the service gets support from other federal agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration and Homeland Security Investigations, which fall under the DHS, as well as state and local law enforcement.The Department of Homeland Security said in a September report that the 2024 election season remains one of its top concerns. Campaign rallies, polling places, government offices and other locations could be attractive targets for “violence or threats,” the department wrote in its 2024 threat assessment, an annual report on the most pressing terrorism threats facing the United States.Jacqueline Alemany and Carol D.

WaPo_10,Pelosi has told House Democrats that Biden may soon be persuaded to exit race,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/nancy-pelosi-biden-close-to-dropping-out/,2024-07-19 09:30:03.844472,,"Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has told some House Democrats she believes President Biden can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November, according to three Democratic officials familiar with her private discussions.Following Biden’s halting debate performance last month, and the panic it unleashed among Democrats in and outside of Washington, Pelosi (D-Calif.) has taken a strong, behind-the-scenes role in trying to resolve the political crisis by playing intermediary for upset rank-and-file Democrats and relaying those messages to the White House.The former speaker, who left her leadership post in 2022 but still wields enormous clout, has told California Democrats and some members of House leadership that she thinks Biden is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid, three Democratic officials said. Some Democrats fear that, by staying in, Biden will end up handing the White House to Donald Trump.Pelosi’s aides declined to address her talks with her congressional colleagues while dismissing the media “feeding frenzy” about her discussions with Biden.“Speaker Pelosi respects the confidentiality of her meetings and conversations with the president of the United States,” a spokesperson for the former speaker said.Biden’s campaign advisers continued Thursday to dismiss talk of replacing him on the ballot.“President Biden has not spoken to Congressional leadership today,” said TJ Ducklo, a campaign spokesman. “The President is his party’s nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He’s running for reelection, and that will not change until he wins reelection.”Rank-and-file Democrats see Pelosi’s hand in a pair of California Democrats calling for Biden to step down, after several days of relative quiet, following the assassination attempt on Trump last weekend. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a close Pelosi ally, formally called for Biden to step aside for another Democrat. Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) followed suit Thursday.Concerns among Democrats about Biden’s bid have increased in recent days. Along with Pelosi, party luminaries including former president Barack Obama, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), have conveyed their concerns about Biden’s continuing candidacy for the White House. Jeffries and Schumer told Biden directly in separate meetings recently that his continued candidacy imperils the Democratic Party’s ability to control either chamber of Congress next year. And Obama has told allies in recent days that Biden needs to seriously reconsider the viability of his candidacy.Pelosi has kept a low public profile since a July 10 appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” which Biden is known to watch, in which she undermined his case for remaining on the November ballot. Democrats saw her nuanced comments — “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run” — as reopening the discussion after Biden had sent a defiant letter to lawmakers two days earlier stating that he was running.Biden campaign officials continued to reject the calls to step aside. “I don’t want to be rude, but I don’t know how many times we can say this: President Biden is staying in this race,” Biden’s principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, told reporters Thursday in Milwaukee.Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, do not seem persuaded.While she is not actively seeking them out, Pelosi has sent word to House Democrats, particularly those facing tough reelection bids this fall, that she is open to talking through the White House political crisis and how to handle the matter, according multiple House Democratic lawmakers and aides.The former speaker took detailed notes during these discussions, particularly on polling data from the lawmakers in their races and about Biden’s standing in those key districts, according to one Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive conversations.These talks, along with private polling data, informed Pelosi’s thinking as she maneuvers through the sensitive discussions with Biden and his inner circle.The Washington Post and other news outlets reported this week on a recent discussion with Biden, during which Pelosi rejected the president’s assertion that he was doing fine in the polls. She asked him to bring a senior adviser into the talk so they could compare in detail their divergent internal polling, according to one person familiar with the conversation.Now 84 and back among the rank and file, Pelosi retains a large degree of clout at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Many lawmakers view her as the best Democrat to deliver the tough message to Biden, in part because he views her as a contemporary with her own legacy.Pelosi also has no individual political aspirations left, having retired from leadership 18 months ago, after 20 years leading House Democrats. She doesn’t have to worry about the ramifications of telling senior leaders what they don’t want to hear, these Democrats say, and the new House leadership appreciates an extra voice in trying to help push Biden into retirement.But Democrats who want to push Biden aside warn that doing so is far from certain. “It’s a work in progress,” one Democratic lawmaker said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss conversations the former speaker has had with members of the California delegation.Pelosi has previously gone to great lengths to avoid appearances of being akin to a co-leader to Jeffries and his top lieutenants, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.).Moments after her floor speech exiting the speakership, Pelosi told a small group of reporters she never wanted lawmakers to see her “being the mother-in-law in the kitchen” trying to explain how her son wanted his Thanksgiving dinner.But in this moment Jeffries, Clark and Aguilar each have their own political sensitivities that make it more difficult to be forceful toward Biden. The Congressional Black Caucus, the base of support for Jeffries over his climb through House leadership, includes several prominent senior Democrats who are among Biden’s staunchest supporters.That’s also the case for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has helped launch Aguilar into rising-star status.So, in this moment, Pelosi has stepped in and played the role of a more blunt messenger to the Biden orbit, channeling what she has heard from her caucus.One Democrat who spoke with her in recent days reached out to the former speaker, asking for her view. Pelosi set up a call and went through all the details of their district and polling, saying she was taking down detailed notes about the data, according to the Democrat.At the end of the call, Pelosi explained that she was not actively reaching out to the rank and file, but she wanted lawmakers to know that she was happy to talk the situation through with anyone.“Just text me,” Pelosi said, according to this Democrat.The lawmaker hung up the phone and immediately texted a group of 50 Democrats telling them that Pelosi was willing to talk.Leigh Ann Caldwell and Ashley Parker contributed to this report."
WaPo_11,Biden faces fresh wave of Democratic doubt as party’s fissures deepen,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/biden-new-doubts-democratic-fissures/,2024-07-19 09:39:03.844472,,"President Biden faced intensifying pressure Thursday to end his reelection bid from an array of Democratic leaders, from former president Barack Obama to top leaders on Capitol Hill to powerful donors to party strategists, as he confronted the most concerted effort yet to force him out of the presidential race amid concerns over his advanced age and sluggish poll numbers.The private but widely voiced doubts of the party’s top leaders — including Obama, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) — spilled into public view as people familiar with their thinking confirmed their growing sense of angst about Biden’s candidacy. And Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) became the second sitting senator calling on Biden to withdraw, after Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.).Obama, seen by many Democrats as the party’s most influential figure, has told allies that Biden should think seriously about the viability of his reelection bid, The Washington Post reported. Pelosi has conveyed a similarly blunt message directly to Biden and his aides in recent days, and she has told some House Democrats she believes Biden can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race, according to three Democratic officials familiar with her private discussions.Jeffries and Schumer, in separate private meetings with Biden last week, told him directly that his continued candidacy imperils the Democratic Party’s ability to control either chamber of Congress next year. The turmoil comes as polls suggest that Biden has slipped dangerously behind Republican nominee Donald Trump in swing states, Democratic donors signal they may start withholding support, lawmakers weigh a more public confrontation with the president next week — and Republicans put on a contrasting display of unity at their convention this week.Taken together, the wave of public doubt surrounding Biden suggests a new, more serious phase in his bid to save his candidacy. As he self-isolates at his Rehoboth Beach, Del., home after testing positive for the coronavirus, the president appears more politically embattled than ever.But his team is showing no public signs of reconsidering his reelection bid.At a campaign news conference in Milwaukee on Thursday morning, Biden’s principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, rebuffed the notion that the president might step aside. “I don’t want to be rude, but I don’t know how many times we can say this: President Biden is staying in this race,” Fulks said.Biden is sending the same message. In an interview with BET that aired Wednesday, the president said he will remain in the race as long as he is healthy. Biden is 81, and Trump is 78.“I think I’ve demonstrated that I know how to get things done for the country, despite the fact that we were told we couldn’t get it done,” Biden said during the interview, which was taped Tuesday in Las Vegas. “But there’s more to do, and I’m reluctant to walk away from that.”Asked whether there was anything that could change his mind about running for another term, Biden said he would only reconsider if “some medical condition” emerged.Biden’s public defiance has been echoed in private as well, according to two people familiar with internal conversations.On Capitol Hill, several Democratic lawmakers are anxiously watching to see if he decides to heed the messages from Schumer, Pelosi, Jeffries and Obama that have leaked, according to one Democratic aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.Many Democratic lawmakers have held back from publicly calling for Biden to exit the race “out of a genuine, deep respect and admiration for him and risk aversion,” the aide said. But if the president does not decide on his own to drop out in the coming days, many lawmakers will be resigned to the fact that they will have to go public with their concerns, two Democratic aides said.On Thursday, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) added his voice to the growing list of lawmakers calling on Biden to consider dropping out of the race, comparing the president to a stellar but tiring baseball pitcher.“There is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out,” Raskin said in a letter to Biden, adding, “and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics.”The New York Times first reported on Raskin’s letter, which was delivered this month.During a July 11 news conference, Biden told reporters that he would step aside only if party leaders told him that he had no chance of winning. The visits from Jeffries and Schumer, coming shortly after the news conference, appeared designed to suggest a message in that vein, though it is not clear how explicit or detailed the leaders were.Jeffries met with Biden on the night of July 11 at the White House, and Schumer visited Biden two days later at his home in Rehoboth Beach. Each leader conveyed concerns that Biden’s continued candidacy would not only pave the way to another Trump presidency, but could also bring down Democrats’ chances to hold their narrow Senate majority and take back the House, The Post has previously reported.Amid the rush of new reports about growing fissures, many Democratic leaders have not disputed the reports about their concerns or used their own voices to express support for Biden — a silence that often appears designed to send its own pointed message.A round of new polls has been amplifying those doubts. Public and private surveys in recent days have indicated that Biden is losing ground against Trump in nearly every swing state, giving him a narrowing path to victory and raising the prospect of a GOP landslide.Additionally, polls conducted after last month’s debate, in which Biden often stumbled and struggled to complete sentences, have found anywhere between 40 percent and 65 percent of Democrats saying the president should drop out of the race.Biden cited different national polls to defend himself against charges that he is losing, calling the race essentially a “toss up,” a sentiment echoed by his campaign aides. That defiance has created distress among some in his party who worry that he is not being briefed on a full range of information about the state of his candidacy.When Biden spoke privately with Pelosi and he pushed back on her message about his dire prospects, saying he was doing fine in the polls, Pelosi responded that she had her own polls showing the opposite. She suggested that Mike Donilon, one of Biden’s top advisers, join the conversation so that they could go line by line and compare their respective polls, according to one person familiar with the discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation. CNN earlier reported on the conversation between Pelosi and Biden.Pelosi’s office declined to discuss the content of their talk. “Speaker Pelosi respects the confidentiality of her meetings and conversations with the president of the United States,” a spokesperson for the former speaker said. “Sadly, the feeding frenzy from the press based on anonymous sources misrepresents any conversations the speaker may have had with the president.”While at least 23 congressional Democrats have called for Biden’s exit from the 2024 race, many more are privately expressing concerns and hoping that Biden will step aside voluntarily, officials said. Some have resorted to calling first lady Jill Biden, according to a person familiar with the calls who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private entreaties.Several ideas are circulating among the lawmakers discussing the best way to pressure Biden if he does not step aside on his own. Some suggest simply releasing statements one after another. Others envision a group of senators warning Biden privately that they will go public if he does not heed their concerns, according to the aides.Other influential lawmakers are sticking by Biden. “My mind has not changed at all,” said Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), one of Biden’s closest allies. “My mind will not change unless he changes his mind.”The defectors, as well as those supporting Biden, are carefully watching the calendar. The Democratic National Convention rules committee meets Friday for the first time, ahead of a critical meeting next week to discuss plans for a “virtual roll call” ahead of the Aug. 19-22 convention.Those backing Biden want the roll call to happen relatively soon to lock in his nomination. Opponents want to delay or scrap it altogether, allowing more time for an alternative nominee to emerge.The uncertainty is also impacting the Biden campaign’s finances. On Wednesday, Semafor reported that Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood figure and campaign co-chair for Biden’s reelection, met with the president and told him major donors had grown anxious about his ability to win in November, a prospect that could harm his fundraising.After a four-day lull in the public calls for him to exit the race as political leaders sought to avoid controversial statements in the aftermath of last weekend’s assassination attempt against Trump, Wednesday saw one of the highest-profile public defections from the president.Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in California and a close Pelosi ally, called on Biden to “pass the torch.”Hours later, the White House announced that Biden had tested positive for the coronavirus and was experiencing mild symptoms, including a cough, runny nose and “general malaise.” That had the effect of sidelining Biden just as he was planning to ramp up his travel around the country to showcase his vigor and build a case against Trump.Instead, Biden abruptly canceled events in Las Vegas on Wednesday and traveled back to Rehoboth Beach.“I am doing well,” Biden told reporters after landing in Delaware on Air Force One late Wednesday night.It was unclear when Biden may return to the campaign trail or how long his illness would sideline him. The president’s physician said Thursday that his vital signs were normal, though he continued to experience “mild upper respiratory symptoms.” When he was last seen in public Wednesday, he appeared to move more slowly than usual.The drama surrounding Biden’s candidacy comes as the Republican National Convention has been taking place in Milwaukee, with allies of Trump coalescing around his candidacy and rejoicing over the disarray Democrats are experiencing.Many Democrats fear that the party’s semi-paralyzed state, as its leaders hint broadly that its presidential candidate should withdraw while he refuses, is the worst possible position for the Democrats. Those fears are exacerbated by the view among many Democrats that Trump would be a uniquely destructive figure should he recapture the White House.Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the focus on disunity among Democrats over Biden was not reflective of the party’s broader shared objective of defeating Trump in November.“President Biden has the committed delegates he needs to be the nominee. He is our nominee,” Padilla added. “And unless or until he suggests different, we’ve got work to do.”Dan Balz and Maeve Reston contributed to this report."
WaPo_12,"DOJ sues nonprofit that houses migrant children, accuses staff of sexual abuse",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/18/doj-shelter-abuse-southwest-key/,2024-07-19 10:55:04.655348,,"A Texas-based nonprofit that contracts with federal immigration authorities to shelter unaccompanied migrant children subjected the youth in its care to pervasive sexual abuse and harassment for almost a decade, the U.S. Justice Department alleged in a lawsuit it filed Wednesday.Youth care workers at Southwest Key Programs, the country’s largest private provider of housing for unaccompanied children which contracts with the Office of Refugee Resettlement and receives grants from the Department of Health and Human Services, repeatedly sexually abused children in the nonprofit’s shelters from 2015 to at least 2023, the lawsuit alleged.At several Southwest Key shelters, staff sexually assaulted children, solicited sexual acts and nude photos and discouraged children from reporting abuse, in some cases threatening them and their families, according to the lawsuit.“In search of the American Dream, children often endure perilous journeys on their migration north to the southern border,” U.S. Attorney Alamdar Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas said a news release. “The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child’s sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare.”Southwest Key said in a statement that the Justice Department’s lawsuit did not “present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.”“We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), as we have done so for the past two decades to ensure the children and youth entrusted to our care are safe with us during their short stay with Southwest Key,” Southwest Key spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said.The Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the Office of Refugee Resettlement, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Southwest Key operates 29 shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, according to the Justice Department. The shelters can accommodate around 6,000 unaccompanied minors who are referred to Southwest Key by federal authorities after arriving at the southern border, the lawsuit states.Southwest Key received over $3 billion in funding from the Department of Health and Human Services between the fiscal years of 2015 and 2023, according to the lawsuit.During that period, Southwest Key received over 100 reports of sexual harassment or abuse of the children under its care, which the nonprofit allowed to continue without adequate intervention, the Justice Department alleged.In 2019, a supervisor at a shelter in Channelview, Tex., repeatedly raped, abused and threatened a teenage girl, who reported the abuse by passing a note to her teacher when the supervisor was on vacation, according to the lawsuit. The girl was transferred to another shelter.That year, a clinician at a shelter in Mesa, Ariz., asked a teenage girl graphic and detailed questions about sex, asked if she wanted a hug and “looked over her body,” prompting the girl to complain, according to the lawsuit.In 2022, a youth care worker at a shelter in El Paso repeatedly sexually abused a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl and threatened to kill the children’s families if they reported the abuse, according to the lawsuit.The lawsuit does not state what happened to the employees accused of abuse after the incidents were reported.Southwest Key employees failed to report knowledge or suspicion of sexual abuse and harassment on numerous occasions and threatened children into silence, the Justice Department alleged. In one case, a child with physical marks on her body who reported sexual assault was allegedly instructed by a Southwest Key employee to “cover up” the marks. In another case, Southwest Key staff allegedly discouraged a child from reporting harassment by telling her it would delay her reunification with her family.Southwest Key’s website states that most children in its care are between the ages of 13 and 17, and are from Central America. The children typically remain in Southwest Key shelters for about 30 days, where staff provide medical care, education and recreational activities, according to the nonprofit and the Justice Department’s lawsuit.The nonprofit grew quickly during the Trump administration and its shelters were among those that absorbed children separated from their families at the border under the former president’s immigration policy in 2018, The Washington Post previously reported.Allegations of abuse and mistreatment at Southwest Key facilities previously emerged when the nonprofit’s facilities came under scrutiny during that period. A Southwest Key employee was convicted in 2018 of sexually abusing seven teenage boys at a facility in Mesa, Ariz.The Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, which advocates for youth to be reunited with family members once they reach the border, said in a statement responding to the lawsuit that large shelters leave unaccompanied minors vulnerable to abuse.“Any child who has been a victim of abuse while in custody deserves immediate care, attention, and justice,” the statement said.The Justice Department’s lawsuit seeks civil penalties and damages for children allegedly abused and harassed at Southwest Key’s facilities."
WaPo_13,"At RNC convention, Republicans differ on how much to focus on abortion",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/republicans-abortion-ban-rnc/,2024-07-19 10:36:04.655348,,"MILWAUKEE — Dozens of speakers this week have taken to the sleek Republican National Convention stage to present a united front on opposing leftism at home and promoting conservative populism.But many have avoided talking about a longtime party priority: ending abortion.After Republicans approved a new party platform Monday that abandoned the party’s long-standing explicit support for a national abortion ban, a small number of speakers have mentioned abortion. Off the convention stage, the most ardent antiabortion activists have condemned the change, but many delegates here have said they understand the adjustment after voters have rejected abortion restrictions. Former president Donald Trump, who accepted the party’s presidential nomination, has said abortion restrictions should be left up to the states. Some supporters are now repeating that message, the latest example of Trump moving the party faithful toward his personal ideology.Wisconsin delegate Dixon Wolfe, 23, studied at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and described himself as “very pro-life.” But he said he understands “the culture is not on board” with the antiabortion movement.“So Republicans need to be practical and pragmatic about the abortion issue, in my opinion,” Wolfe said. “They need to definitely leave it up to the states like Trump has said.”At campaign speeches, in social media posts and on mailers, Trump has touted his role in “ending Roe,” after three Supreme Court justices he nominated helped overturn the law that for nearly 50 years had protected the right to abortion. His newly named running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), had previously endorsed national restrictions on abortion. But during his acceptance speech Wednesday night, Vance didn’t mention abortion.Some delegates were disappointed and said they wanted to see the party push for a national ban. The party platform has long advocated for a 20-week abortion ban but dropped that from this week’s document. The new platform still includes language that links abortion to the 14th Amendment, leaving open a path to legislation or court decisions that would grant fetuses additional legal rights. But some antiabortion advocates are upset that the platform no longer says that “the unborn child has a fundamental right to life” and no longer explicitly says the 14th Amendment should be clarified to protect embryos and fetuses.David Lightner, a Missouri delegate and an RNC committeeman, said he was “a little disturbed” by the change.“I know everybody on the ground is not happy,” he said. “We’re pro-lifers in Missouri. That’s what we’re all about.”Missouri delegate Zina Hackworth looked around the cavernous Fiserv Forum on Monday during the platform vote, expecting someone to step up and object, but she was frustrated when no one did, and it overwhelmingly passed. Since then, Hackworth said she has heard some speakers mention abortion in passing, but it has mattered little to her.“If our platform doesn’t say it, it’s a moot point to me,” she said. “Don’t tell me that you’re protecting life if you’re not telling the whole story.”In one of the few mentions of abortion policy, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who chaired the platform committee, declared ahead of the Monday vote that the platform is “protecting life for the born and unborn.”Utah delegate Gayle Ruzicka, who was on the committee but complained that antiabortion activists had little say in the plank, shook her head at Blackburn’s mention of the unborn.“She made that up,” she whispered to a delegate next to her.Diane Hendricks, a Trump donor who spoke Thursday night, seemed to allude to the abortion debate in passing — saying that she got pregnant at 17 and gives “thanks every day for my son.”“I truly believe that every life is a sacred gift from God,” she said. But she did not connect her personal experience to any discussion of abortion policy.North Carolina Evangelical Rev. Franklin Graham also briefly mentioned the issue in a call-and-response portion of his speech in which he listed the actions Trump took to appeal to Christian demands.“When he told me and our country in 2016 that he was going to appoint conservative justices in 2016, guess what he did?” Graham asked.“He did,” the audience responded.To Julie Emmons, a delegate from Graham’s state, that mention was about the Dobbs decision.“I can’t think of a more important topic to talk about than protecting life,” she said, acknowledging that she didn’t want to criticize the speakers who had left out the topic.Blocks from the convention, Jessica Newell, a 21-year-old Live Action activist, inflated red heart-shaped balloons ahead of the platform vote and expressed frustration when she heard it was about to pass. She warned that Republicans may lose a solid base of support. The majority of Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 57 percent, believe abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Meanwhile, 85% of Democrats and Democratic leaners said it should be legal.“A lot of people I’ve talked to talk about being politically homeless,” she said. “Our options are voting Democrat or voting Democrat.”But Trump allies, including some who feel strongly about abortion, are skeptical that Trump’s effort to thread the needle on that issue would cost him with socially conservative voters, given their staunch support for him and his agenda overall.Abortion came up with greater frequency during a Thursday morning breakfast hosted by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a Christian group closely allied with Trump. Hackworth attended, donning gold lapel pins shaped like hands and feet that have developed in the womb at 10 weeks and listened as Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley declared that he was proud to be “the most pro-life chair in the history of the Republican Party.”“How can anyone say we’re the party of life?” Hackworth asked rhetorically. “I’m just tuning that out now.”"
WaPo_14,‘I Divorce You’: Dubai princess’s Instagram declaration defies custom,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/dubai-princess-divorce-sheikha-mahra-instagram/,2024-07-19 10:14:04.655348,,"One of the daughters of Dubai’s ruler announced her intent to seek a divorce in an Instagram post Wednesday, making Sheikha Mahra bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum the latest princess of the emirate to publicly counter the norms of her country — and of her father, the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai.“I hereby declare our divorce,” wrote Mahra, the daughter of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. “I divorce you, I divorce you, and I Divorce You. Take care. Your ex-wife.”In repeating the phrase “I divorce you” three times, the princess appeared to be referencing the controversial practice of triple talaq. Customarily, under Sunni Islamic law, triple talaq allows a Muslim man to divorce his wife by saying talaq — the Arabic word for divorce — three times. The man does not need to offer a reason or obtain his wife’s agreement.In the UAE, Islamic law governs marriage and divorce proceedings for Muslim couples, as well as for couples of a Muslim man and a non-Muslim woman, according to the country’s government website. Non-Muslim expatriate couples, however, have the option of seeking a divorce in their home country or of petitioning the court to request that their home country’s laws be applied in the UAE.Under sharia law, women typically receive a dowry — or, in Arabic, mahr — from their husband or their husband’s family upon marriage. Once a woman returns the mahr, she is able to legally obtain a separation, called khula.Mahra married Sheikh Mana bin Mohammed bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum, who is also a member of the UAE’s royal family, in a glamorous ceremony last May. The couple welcomed a daughter less than three months ago.The princess suggested in her Wednesday post that her husband had been unfaithful to her, saying that he was “occupied with other companions.” Her apparent invocation of triple talaq broke from the practice’s typical implementation, as it is men who invoke talaq under Islamic law.Mahra is hardly the first female relative of Sheikh Mohammed to take a stand that counters the emirate’s norms.Sheikha Latifa, Mahra’s sister and a fellow princess of the emirate, described her father as a “major criminal” and deemed him responsible for imprisoning disobedient women before she fled Dubai, the New Yorker reported last May. Though the prime minister of the UAE has highlighted gender equality in his public and political life, particularly while engaged in diplomacy with the West, Latifa saw Dubai as repressive for women — even as the ruler’s daughter.Latifa is one of at least two Dubai princesses who attempted to escape their family by fleeing the emirate, The Washington Post reported in 2019.Sheikh Mohammed also had a lengthy and contentious international custody battle with his sixth wife, Princess Haya Bint Hussein. Hussein sought asylum in Germany in 2019, the BBC reported, and ultimately went into hiding in London, as she feared for her life after fleeing from her husband. The prime minister has at least 20 children with at least six wives.In the UAE, a Muslim woman is not legally permitted to marry a non-Muslim man without proof of his conversion. A Muslim man is permitted to marry a non-Muslim woman and is also permitted to have up to four wives, so long as he offers “equal sustenance and equal treatment to all,” according to the government website.Since Mahra’s announcement, both she and Sheikh Mana appear to have scrubbed all photos of each other from their respective Instagram pages."
WaPo_15,"Hulk Hogan rips off his shirt, endorses Trump at the RNC",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/07/18/hulk-hogan-trump-rnc/,2024-07-19 10:55:04.655348,,"Hulk Hogan — a crossover superstar of professional wrestling’s 1980s golden era — made his biggest foray into the political arena Thursday at the closing night of the Republican National Convention, ripping off his shirt and calling Donald Trump his “hero.”Appearing onstage to cheers of “USA! USA!,” Hogan recalled the assassination attempt on Trump, saying “enough was enough” as he began tearing his shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance muscle tank underneath.Comparing Trump and running mate J.D. Vance to himself and “Macho Man” Randy Savage, he said the ticket made up the “greatest tag team of my life.”Before his appearance, the muscled and mustachioed brawler turned to social media with a special message for the fans that had nothing to do with the campaign.“You know something? Real American Beer is taking Missouri by storm, and the Ozarks is no different!” the 70-year-old star roared into the camera on Wednesday, plugging his weekend stops at two waterfront bars to promote his new branded line of canned lager. “Rock-and-roll and Hulk Hogan’s Real American Beer go together!”In the past, Hogan endorsed Barack Obama and teased that he himself might run for president. But until now, he had not widely publicized his thoughts about the 2024 election.His biggest political role to date came in the court battle that destroyed the popular gossip blog Gawker, which came to stand as something of a proxy battle for a larger culture war.Trump has a long showbiz connection to professional wrestling, from his early sponsorship of WrestleMania events to his scripted participation in fight storylines — shoving WWE impresario Vince MacMahon backward over a table in one routine and allowing “Stone Cold” Steve Austin to fling him to the mat in another. Dana White, the president and chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship and another longtime Trump associate, also spoke Thursday.But other than the occasional shout-out, Hulk Hogan — real name, Terry Bollea — never conspicuously intersected with those storylines, nor with Trump’s political rise.This is @HulkHogan's promo before WrestleMania 4 in 1988, which was held at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.""Thank God Donald Trump is a Hulkamaniac!"" pic.twitter.com/mgS7arxUGeDuring his 1980s and ’90s heyday, though, the wrestler at least flirted with political symbolism.Styling himself as an underdog American hero and paragon of patriotism, Hogan consistently battled caricatured foreign adversaries — the Iron Sheik, Andre the Giant, Killer Khan — who were cast as villains in the fictional wrestling world.He walked to the ring accompanied by the entrance song “Real American,” often wearing red-white-and-blue bandannas or carrying an American flag.At other times, his foils were wealthy snobs — a popular target for wrestling’s working-class fans — like the “Million Dollar Man” Ted DiBiase, who wore a glittery and gold-studded championship belt and tried to “buy” the WWE’s world title away from Hogan.His popularity foreshadowed the future crossover success of wrestlers-turned-movie stars like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and John Cena. Hogan went mainstream — hosting “Saturday Night Live,” landing on the cover of Wheaties boxes and taking roles in films like “Rocky III” and “Suburban Commando,” where he played a super-galactic hero living in the suburbs.His similarly charismatic wrestling colleague Jesse Ventura crossed all the way over into real-life American politics, eventually becoming the one-term governor of Minnesota.But Hogan’s spotlight faded as he continued to put himself up against younger talent and lose.In 2012, Gawker published a two-minute clip of a leaked sex tape from 2006, showing Hogan in bed with Heather Clem, the wife of his best friend, radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge. Hogan later said that he had his friend’s blessing to have sex with his wife.But the wrestler sued Gawker in 2013 for invasion of privacy, among other claims, saying he had not given his consent to be recorded.Despite initial rulings from federal judges that the publication was newsworthy and protected — Gawker argued that Hogan had made his sex life central to his public persona — the lawsuit in 2016 came before a Florida jury, which delivered a $140 million verdict in Hogan’s favor.A settlement later brought the sum down to $31 million, but Gawker filed for bankruptcy in June 2016. Days before, tech billionaire Peter Thiel went public to acknowledge that he had quietly funded Hogan’s litigation to the tune of $10 million as something of a personal vendetta.For years, the PayPal founder had carried a grudge against Gawker, after sister site Valleywag had reported on the fact that he was gay — an open secret at the time in venture capital circles.Valleywag, though, had also provided skeptical coverage of tech companies and their founders — a rising class of powerful business executives such as Thiel, who would go on to endorse Trump’s 2016 campaign and mentor Trump’s 2024 running mate, J.D. Vance. And so the case took on added dimensions as a skirmish in a larger backlash by conservatives against media outlets they deemed hostile.1/5The case took its toll on Hogan. Audio recordings revealed during the litigation captured him uttering racist insults, which prompted WWE to terminate his contract.But just three years later, in 2018, he was welcomed back into the WWE universe and reinstated into the WWE Hall of Fame. Since then he has shown up on occasional television shows and major events. His career was highlighted by WWE in January of this year in a 40th anniversary special video.Hogan’s political views have shifted as quickly as a wrestling gimmick. He endorsed Barack Obama ahead of the 2008 election, but changed his tune for 2012 — which might have been related to Obama using Hogan’s “Real American” song as a gag riffing on the conspiracy theories about the former president’s birthplace, an early Trump talking point.In 2015, Hogan made the case that he should be Trump’s running mate. But just as recently as a few weeks ago he suggested he’d run for president himself.“We need somebody in there that’s got some common sense,” he told Fox News in June.In an October 2020 Instagram post, he gave perhaps his strongest endorsement until now.“All the Hulkmaniacs, make sure you go vote. You know what I’m saying?” he said. “Otherwise I might just have to run for president if we don’t straighten this crap out.”"
WaPo_16,Appeals court blocks Biden’s student loan repayment plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/18/biden-student-loan-repayment-plan-blocked/,2024-07-19 10:58:04.655348,,"A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked President Biden’s new student loan repayment plan, leaving millions of borrowers enrolled in the cost-cutting program in the lurch.The decision follows a whiplash of rulings last month in two separate Republican-led lawsuits seeking to end the Saving on a Valuable Education program, commonly known as Save. The flurry of orders from the cases has created chaos for borrowers who want to enroll in the plan or who are already signed up and need to know what their monthly bill will be.In the latest development, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit sided with Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and five other Republican-led states that requested the court stop the Biden administration from implementing Save amid its ongoing litigation. The states had scored a partial injunction from a lower court in June that blocked the Education Department from forgiving any loans through the program then successfully petitioned the appeals court to stop the plan altogether.In a post on X, Bailey called the appeals court decision a “HUGE win for every American who still believes in paying their own way.” He said Save is an “illegal student loan plan, which would have saddled working Americans with half-a-trillion dollars in Ivy League debt.”Late Thursday night, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the department will place all borrowers enrolled in Save in an interest-free forbearance while the Biden administration continues to defend the plan in court.“Today’s ruling from the 8th Circuit blocking President Biden’s SAVE plan could have devastating consequences for millions of student loan borrowers crushed by unaffordable monthly payments if it remains in effect,” Cardona said in a statement. “It’s shameful that politically motivated lawsuits waged by Republican elected officials are once again standing in the way of lower payments for millions of borrowers.”The Save plan provides lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers and a faster path to cancellation. It has already wiped clear the balances of 414,000 enrollees who originally borrowed less than $12,000 and had been paying for at least 10 years. More than 8 million people are enrolled in the repayment plan, which ties monthly payments to earnings and family size. The program is an amended version of an existing repayment plan known as Revised Pay as You Earn, or Repaye. All income-driven plans promise to forgive a borrower’s balance after 20 or 25 years of payments, but the Save plan shortens the timeline for people who took out small loans.The six states had filed a lawsuit in April accusing Biden of overstepping his authority with the creation of Save. Missouri’s attorney general also argued that the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, a quasi-state agency that services federal student loans and funds state scholarships, would lose revenue when the loans are canceled. In June, U.S. District Judge John A. Ross halted any further loan forgiveness and questioned whether Congress had envisioned a loan repayment plan as far-reaching as Save, signaling the program could be overturned.On the same day that Ross handed down his injunction in Missouri, U.S. District Judge Daniel D. Crabtree in Kansas blocked the Biden administration from cutting the monthly payments of Save enrollees starting in July.In the rapid-fire back-and-forth over Save this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit granted the administration’s request that the Kansas ruling be set aside, allowing the Education Department to move forward with lowering payments under Save.Within days, the three Republican-led states involved in the lawsuit — Alaska, South Carolina and Texas — petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene.The Biden administration argued that tabling Save amid ongoing litigation would cause widespread harm to borrowers and administrative chaos.“To revert to the pre-Save plan approach, the Department and its servicers would have to reprogram their systems, retrain their staff, and recalculate monthly payments,” Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote in a court filing Wednesday. “That process would take at least several months, during which the Department would have no choice but to place many borrowers into forbearance until servicers are able to bill them for the new amounts.”That scenario could now play out in the wake of Thursday’s ruling.Student advocates say the 8th Circuit ruling could upend the lives of millions of borrowers who have come to rely on the low monthly payments afforded through Save and place them at greater risk of falling behind on payments.“This decision threatens the entire federal student loan system and will cause complete chaos and confusion,” said Eileen Connor, president and executive director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending. “The Save plan was created to allow low-income borrowers a fair path to repay their federal student loans and instead they will now have a greater risk of default and serious financial consequences.”"

Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.The metamorphosis of the party of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan into something rather different — the party of Hulk Hogan, perhaps — is almost complete. The Republicans, in thrall to former and perhaps future president Donald Trump, have embraced his illiberal nationalism, his protectionist zeal and his anti-migrant nativism. In the figure of Trump’s tapped deputy, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), they have a youthful heir apparent to the “America First” movement who seems poised to drill down on its radical ideological moorings.For decades, the Republicans styled themselves as the party of big business and free trade. At the Republican National Convention this week, Trump vowed more tariffs and Vance declared an end to the era of “catering to Wall Street” and championed “the working man.” For decades, the Republicans styled themselves as the more muscular actors on the world stage, boosters of military spending and hawkish on the threats posed by autocrats abroad. Yet Vance and like-minded lawmakers opposed fresh military aid to Ukraine for months, while Trump has a conspicuously cuddly rapport with many foreign strongmen, not least Russian President Vladimir Putin.In his last speech as president in 1989, Reagan famously extolled immigration as the core driver of the  United States’ incomparable strength and vitality. He also passed legislation that provided amnesty to millions of undocumented people in the country. Fast forward to the present: Trump, the Republican standard-bearer, was greeted on the convention floor in Milwaukee with placards calling for “Mass Deportations,” while both he and Vance stoked hysteria about a surge in migration being the root cause of spikes in crime, rises in housing prices and inflation. (None of these claims are borne out by evidence.)In all this, the Republicans under Trump have shed the trappings of a “mainstream” right-wing party for a platform more akin to the far-right parties in ascendance in Europe. For years, experts in comparative politics have charted how the U.S. Republicans have drifted ideologically away from their traditional center-right peers across the pond and toward more extremist and illiberal factions. In 2024, the Republican Party shares far more in common, for example, with France’s National Rally — which is virulently anti-migrant, calls for forms of state welfarism and has documented links to the Kremlin — than it did with the French far right just a decade ago.The Trump-Vance ticket seems to cement this transformation. Vance, in particular, has leaned into championing an overt “blood and soil” nationalism. In his Wednesday speech, he scoffed at the lofty, universalist ideals that often accompany paeans to American patriotism, and spoke instead of the cemetery in eastern Kentucky where his forebears are buried.“Even though the ideas and the principles are great, that is a homeland. That is our homeland,” Vance said. “People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home. And if this movement of ours is going to succeed, and if this country is going to thrive, our leaders have to remember that America is a nation.”Vance added that his family “would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to.”John Ganz, a commentator and historian of populism, linked Vance’s rhetoric — his grandstanding over the bones of his ancestors — to what the venerable French historian Michel Winock once described as “mortuary nationalism.” Winock was trying to place a frame over France’s evolving politics at the turn of the previous century, when a host of Catholic nationalists and reactionary thinkers like the philosopher Charles Maurras (much admired by Trump whisperer Stephen K. Bannon) were coming to the fore.Their proto-fascist brand of nationalism, Winock explained, would “subordinate everything to … the nation-state: to its force, its power, and its greatness.” And its appeal hinged on the promise of “a resurrection: the restoration of state authority, the strengthening of the army, the protection of the old ways, the dissolution of divisive forces.” But Winock adds, such politics only gave momentum to, “in varying dosages, xenophobia, antisemitism and anti-parliamentarianism” — the latter, from our 21st century perspective, can be understood as a hostility to the constitutional functioning of democracy.It’s still unclear how deep Trump and the vice-presidential nominee’s avowed set of beliefs may be. “Vance articulates a very clear perspective on the failure of what he’ll call the ‘market fundamentalism’ of the GOP — the consensus economic policy of the last few decades,” Oren Cass, president of American Compass, a think tank closely tied to the economic populists in the GOP, told my colleague Jeff Stein.Still, others suggest reasons to be skeptical about Republican pro-worker rhetoric. “Vance’s attacks on big business came despite his brief political career being backed by some of the wealthiest men in the U.S., including libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, and as he formally joined a Trump campaign supported by Wall Street titans such as Stephen Schwarzman and Bill Ackman,” noted the Financial Times. Over the weekend, Elon Musk — hardly a friend of labor — announced he would commit around $45 million each month to a pro-Trump super PAC.In the broader scheme, Trump’s GOP is participating in the same conversation taking place in many countries in Europe. It shares the same antipathy and disquiet over pro-feminist legislation and “gender ideology” that has animated parties like Spain’s far-right Vox. Like the far-right Alternative for Germany party, it sees environmental regulations and climate action — a “scam,” as Trump put it in his speech Thursday night — as an impediment to economic growth. It looks admiringly at the crackdown on liberal civil society and universities carried out by Hungary’s ruling Fidesz. And the Vance wing of the Republican Party, like some of their European nationalist counterparts, is eager to end military assistance to Ukraine, no matter if that means allowing Russia’s invasion to change the country’s borders.This week, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov cheered Vance’s addition to the ticket. “We can only welcome that because that’s what we need — to stop pumping Ukraine full of weapons, and then the war will end,” Lavrov said."

My first name, while standard, is not so common. For the purposes of this question, I’ll call myself Whitney Joseph.I go by my first name, Whitney. I have always introduced myself that way. But all my life, there have been people who seem unable to address me as Whitney and instead call me Joseph, or some variation like Joe.I work for a large corporation and my job involves a lot of emails. My email signature reads “Whitney Joseph,” and I always end my emails with “Best regards, Whitney.” Yet people still address me in emails as Joseph. I usually say nothing and figure they will eventually catch on (many do). But sometimes, I am annoyed by this and want to say something.What do I say? And how do I say it in a way that does not violate my employer’s code of polite email communication?“It’s Whitney, actually. I know it can be confusing.”How sad that your employer had to make a conduct code about polite emails. That you are now in fear of violating it, however, tells Miss Manners why it was necessary.Dear Miss Manners: Wouldn’t it be the choice of the bride and groom as to whether they invite children to their wedding?I have attended many weddings where children under the age of 18 were not invited. Our son and his bride planned a small wedding (around 80 people) and requested no children in attendance, with the exception of the two in the wedding party. Even those two would be leaving after the ceremony to be watched by a sitter, whom the couple had hired to watch the children of the families invited.Family members with questions about why such-and-such adults were invited, and not their little darlings, were addressed beforehand. All seemed well, and everyone agreed to comply.Or so we thought! One couple showed up with their children in tow: the very aunt and uncle who had been questioning the no-kids policy just days prior. The wedding planner kindly asked them if they would take their children to the sitter provided. They adamantly refused and made a huge scene. Not wanting to cause any more of an upset, we moved forward with the wedding.Was it too much of us to expect respect for the couple’s wishes? Or was it rude of them to bring their children?Child-free weddings, especially ones that are out of town, do indeed make it difficult for families with young offspring. But as the rules of this wedding were clear and consistent, and a sitter was provided, Miss Manners agrees that your relatives were rude to bring them anyway.And certainly to cause a scene — especially since avoiding public tantrums was undoubtedly the idea behind excluding children in the first place.New Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

WaPo_21,Asking Eric: My daughter is dating an aspiring bartender. I don’t approve.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/19/asking-eric-daughter-boyfriend-job/,2024-07-19 11:59:03.910548,,"Dear Eric: My daughter is dating a young man whose parents, at one point, belonged to some religious group that believed in having lots of children — so they had 12. Sam is right in the middle. As far as I can tell, the kids were expected to more or less raise themselves, and all were home-schooled.Sam has a learning disability, which his parents ignored, and he has flunked out of college twice. He has lots of intelligence but not the tools to use it. Life has taught him that he is on his own and that few people can be trusted. He is not on good terms with his parents. But he loves my daughter, which counts for something with me.He also dislikes me and our family because he learned that I was encouraging my daughter to get to know a guy who was interested in her who had a PhD. The PhD turned out to be a real jerk, but Sam now bears a grudge against me for being “elitist.” (Shame on me for thinking a PhD has better job prospects than a high school grad.)Sam currently works in a bar with hopes of learning how to be a bartender. His plan for the future is to marry my daughter and make a go of being a carpenter. I find myself not being crazy about the guy.Are we elitist for wanting our daughter to find a partner who has a decent relationship with his family and some kind of viable career path?— Protective ParentParent: You refuse to accept Sam for who he is, so it doesn’t take an educated guess to see why the foundation of your relationship with him is rotten. This not only negatively impacts your connection with him but has the potential to drive a wedge between you and your daughter.Could Sam, conceivably, make more money with a PhD? Sure, in theory, but which industry? How long will it take? He could also make more money as surgeon general or as an astronaut or a TikTok star. In theory. Moreover, the actual person with a PhD whom you encouraged your daughter to drop Sam for was a jerk. So, what are we doing here? You’ve created a series of what-ifs that are keeping you from seeing what-is.Let's drill down on what is:Should he choose to pursue it, carpentry is a viable career path. Per the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there are, on average, about 79,500 new carpentry openings per year and, as an apprenticeship-based field, it doesn't have many barriers to entry.More importantly, Sam loves your daughter; your daughter has chosen Sam. He doesn't have a good relationship with his family, but do you expect him to be on great terms with people who neglected him? Don't blame him for where he comes from. See him for what he's overcome and who he is trying to become.If you want Sam to like your family, you need to make some amends. Acknowledge that you tried to undercut him and that it was wrong. If you're worried about his career prospects, what can you do to help him in his pursuits?You can salvage this, but continuing to make Sam feel bad about himself because of things that are beyond his control will most likely backfire. Whereas, if you make this right and continue to build a healthy relationship with him, you may get a friend and family rate on future carpentry needs. With the price of lumber what it is, that's nothing to sneeze at!Dear Eric: My daughter married a man who had two young children in a 50/50 custody relationship between him and his ex, their mother. My daughter was “in the role” of mother for half of their lives, but is identified by her first name only, never as “mom.” My dilemma is: Do I send a Happy Mother’s Day card to my daughter, or would that be out of line?— Card CarryingCard: The mad geniuses who stock the greeting card aisle seem to have thought through every permutation of human relationships. (“Happy Flag Day to My Favorite Barista!” “My Condolences for the Death of the Orchid You Bought in a Grocery Store”.) Consider picking up one of the cards specifically addressed to stepmoms next Mother’s Day.This question is also an opportunity for you to have an illuminating conversation with your daughter. Try asking something like “How does Mother’s Day feel to you? Do the kids reach out? Is there a way you wish it was different? Are there things about it that you’re surprised you enjoy?” Her insights into her position may surprise you and I’m sure she’d be grateful to get your perspective on recognizing motherhood.(Send questions to R.

WaPo_22,Carolyn Hax: Wife’s ‘executive dysfunction rut’ means spouse is stuck in chores,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/19/carolyn-hax-wife-executive-dysfunction/,2024-07-19 11:59:03.910548,,"Dear Carolyn: My wife and I have been together since 2012. Since then, we’ve both been diagnosed with ADHD, and this comes with a fun symptom called executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction makes it very difficult to find the willpower and energy to do anything that doesn’t give you dopamine, meaning that for years, many chores around the house were left undone until it was absolutely necessary (e.g., no more clothes to wear so we have no choice but to do laundry).Long story short, we both were prescribed Adderall, and while it has been an unmitigated success for me, my wife found the side effects intolerable, so she stopped taking it.That’s fine with me, but I’m stuck doing all the chores while my wife is stuck in the executive dysfunction rut I used to be in. This isn’t a case of being married to a do-nothing lowlife — I absolutely empathize with her struggles to do basic tasks — but this also means I get no help around the house and any help I do get, I have to specifically ask her for.I’ve tried getting her to do a chore regularly, but she only does it for a few days and it goes back to being my chore.— B.B.: I’m going to be really happy for you that you got a diagnosis and treatment combo that makes function out of your dysfunction.Then I’m going to disagree with you on a bunch of stuff. It’s not Adderall or bust; there are other stimulants, and there are other medications that aren’t stimulants, and there are other treatments that aren’t meds. (I’m not a doctor or a client, nor am I playing one on TV, I’ve just been at this awhile.)And your wife’s decision to drop the meds and stop there is not in fact “fine with me,” or else your letter wouldn’t exist.I do agree with you that your wife isn’t some “do-nothing lowlife.” Even in the negative, that wording’s a little harsh, but I appreciate your point and it needs to be said; executive function disorders are a brain issue and not an entitlement issue.In principle, at least.In practice, they can feel a lot like entitlement issues if both parties involved aren’t careful: If you start to carry the entire household workload for both of you, and if doing this wears you down to a nub, and if your spouse effectively sits by and watches this happen, then do you think the resentment will feel different? The resentment if your wife chooses not to try other treatments vs. the resentment if she chooses not to lift a finger to help you?Again, there is a huge difference between an impairment and an entitlement. Gaping.But if you believe your spouse could do more to address her condition toward carrying more of the workload at home, then her not doing so will read to you emotionally as a choice.As in, it will become a pebble in the marital shoe. In the way someone exhausting but clearly 100 percent unable to pitch in — an infant or an invalid, say — would not.So my advice is to get ahead of any resentment. Ask her to explore other treatments. More aptly: to accept her executively functional spouse exploring them for her. If no, then say why that’s not tenable.And/or, hire help.And/or, adopt a beepy e-calendar system — which you run. (Sorry.)And/or, simplify everything.As in: Make home life sustainable. Because what drains you now will break you later if there’s no relief in sight."

The IDF said it increased air patrols “to protect Israeli airspace.” No siren was activated, and the IDF said the incident was under review.The military spokesman of the Houthis, a Yemen-based group that has been lobbing drones at southern Israel for months by sea, said on social media early Friday that the group will reveal details about the “operation” that targeted Tel Aviv.The unprecedented attack took place hours after the Israeli air force killed a top commander of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon with which Israel has been exchanging fire. Israel’s aerial defense system, outfitted for rockets, has for months struggled to identify and eliminate drone attacks in Israel’s north.In the hours following the explosion, Israeli bomb disposal experts and rescue teams were operating at the site. Police urged residents to avoid approaching the scene and touching “rocket remnants that may contain explosives.”It was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the U.S. Embassy branch office. U.S. Embassy officials in Israel did not respond to request for comment early Friday.This is a developing story and will be updated."

So has her husband, Jared Kushner, who had been a key strategist in his political operation. Barron, Donald and Melania’s only son, hadn’t been around either. There was one Trump, however, whose absence had been most conspicuous.Have you seen his wife?Finally, around 8:30 local time Thursday night, it seemed the blessed visitation was imminent. The VIP box was conspicuously empty; Trump, who had been sitting there with a handful of GOP lawmakers and celebrities, was nowhere to be found. Then, “Soul Man” played, and a parade of Trumps filed in. She would join them soon, but even then, the question lingered.Where is Melania Trump? It was a question that sparked curiosity far beyond Milwaukee this week. Google searches for “Where is Melania Trump?” spiked each night of the convention, peaking around the time Trump made his nightly triumphant entrance without his wife.Rows of delegates craned their necks. “Is that her next to Trump?” one wondered aloud. Nope, that was Lara.False alarm.But when Eric Trump finished his speech, Donald Trump, once again, left the box. The opening strains of the third movement of Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 9” (Op. 125) floated from the sound system.“Ladies and gentlemen, the next first lady of the United States,” the announcer said.Delegates sprang to their feet. Screams of delight echoed across the bowl of the arena. Melania glided along the convention hall’s crimson carpet in a skirt and blazer of the same color. A wide, placid smile stretched across her face. With every few steps, she gave a small wave.For many attendees, it was one more wish fulfilled. The Republican delegates who missed her public appearances couldn’t wait to see her.“She’s so elegant,” Dalene McCormick, 59, a delegate from Hawaii, said on the convention floor Wednesday. She teared up as she talked about the former first lady and the recent attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Butler, Pa.“You can just tell how much he loves her — and how much she supports her husband,” McCormick said.But what took her so long? To the Republican delegates who admire her, Melania’s absence was understandable.“Primarily, she is all of us — a wife and a mother first,” said Kim Coleman, an RNC committeewoman from Utah. “Someone attacked her husband this week and almost killed him. That’s who she is right now, having survived that.”“It’s always family first,” said Mindy Colbert, 42, a delegate from Indiana. “She may need time to process all of what happened.”“I’ve been married for 38 years — I’d be hiding in a closet if that happened to me,” said Tammy Burnham, a delegate from Illinois. “There’s no way I could face the public.”Even before the shooting, Melania’s attendance at the Republican National Convention wasn’t confirmed. Trump supporters can explain that, too. Maybe she was still mourning her mother, who’d passed away in January. Maybe she was trying to maximize her time with Barron, who’d be leaving for college in a few weeks. Why would she want to come here, anyway, and subject herself to the critics? Jill Biden, they’ll remind you, has been featured in Vogue three times, but Melania — a former model! — never was.“She’s been so disrespected — she can do nothing right,” added Burnham. “I’d feel betrayed by this country, if I were her.”On Thursday morning, the campaign promised she’d be in Trump’s VIP box later that day. Doubts lingered: CNN rotated through conflicting chyrons throughout the afternoon — she’ll be there, she won’t be. Just as the convention hall began to fill with delegates for the night’s festivities, the Daily Mail published a photograph of the former first lady, in a black blouse and khaki skirt, boarding Trump Force One with Jared and Ivanka.So, she’d be there — but she wouldn’t speak. Melania’s Republican National Convention  debut in 2016 had been a disaster. Her speechwriter had cribbed sections from remarks Michelle Obama delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008. Her address in 2020, however, had been a relative triumph. Where her husband delayed acknowledging the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, she offered her “deepest sympathy” to those who had lost loved ones to the disease. In a summer of civil unrest, Melania acknowledged the “harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history.” Where Donald Trump resisted responsibility for wrongdoing, Melania noted error and fault. “Instead of tearing things down, let’s reflect on our mistakes,” she said, “and look to a way forward.”Each first-lady-in-waiting approaches the campaign trail differently, but usually to the same intended effect: to humanize her husband. That task has instead fallen to the next generation of Trumps, who participate in his political operation to varying degrees. Don Jr. is his most consistent political road warrior, performing a sort of MAGA-inspired stand-up routine about “his father” at pro-Trump gatherings around the country. Lara posts videos of her children curled onto their grandfather’s lap in the penthouse of Trump Tower. Both Trump sons and their partners took the convention stage this week, taking care to refer to the former president almost exclusively as “my father” or “my father-in-law.” Kai Trump, the former president’s 17-year-old granddaughter, made her political debut. “A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he’s still standing,” Don Jr.’s daughter said to cheers.It wasn’t just that Melania hadn’t been at the Republican convention before she stepped in Thursday’s spotlight on the floor. She hasn’t really been seen in public, period, since her husband launched his reelection campaign. She didn’t go to the New York courthouse or the D.C. courthouse or the Georgia courthouse or the Miami courthouse when her husband pleaded not guilty to a collective 88 charges. She’d missed his conviction on hush money charges in May, leaving her husband in the care of some of his children.The last time she made a campaign appearance was more than 20 months ago, when Donald Trump announced his third run for the presidency from the gilded confines of Mar-a-Lago. She hasn’t been to a single campaign rally of the 2024 cycle — including the one Saturday in Pennsylvania when her husband survived an attempt on his life.The violence coaxed a rare public statement from the typically taciturn first lady. “A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald’s passion — his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,” Melania wrote in a statement on Sunday. “The core facets of my husband’s life — his human side — were buried below the political machine.”She’d been called upon to humanize her husband in circumstances far beyond her control. Melania would do the rest, it seems, on her own terms.Trump told the story of the shooting for the first time on Thursday night. He stood before a backdrop of photographs from that day, a dozen copies of his bloody ear blown up and stacked several stories high. As he talked about the “bullets flying” over him, the former first lady sat in her white armchair, solemn and perfectly still.“I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump said. “Yes, you are!” the crowd began to chant.Melania looked around the room. A small smile spread across her lips.Jesús Rodríguez, Dylan Wells and Sabrina Rodriguez contributed to this report."

He said this would be the only time he would recount that day’s events because it was too painful to recount. The former president touched on many of his usual stump-speech themes — saying the world was teetering on the brink of World War III and, without evidence, accused opponents of “cheating on elections.” He also promised to finish the campaign strong. “Otherwise, we’ll blow it,” Trump added. “And we can’t let that happen.”"

The Grammy award-winning singer also signed copies of his “God Bless the USA Bible,” which have been on sale at the convention all week. (Copies signed by Trump are available online for $1,000).On the last night of the convention, pro wrestler Hulk Hogan walked out onto the RNC stage carrying an American flag with “Real American” by Rick Derringer playing in the background. The song is known as Hogan’s WWE theme song, and a montage featuring his storied career also played on the jumbotron above him.Ahead of Trump’s address, Kid Rock performed his 2000 song “American Bad A--,” substituting some of the lyrics with references to the attempted assassination of the former president on Saturday.“I need everyone to put a fist up in the air!” Rock said as he jumped onto the stage. “Say Fight, Fight, Fight! Say Trump, Trump!”During his much anticipated speech at the convention, Trump thanked Rock for his performance.“Thank you, Kid Rock. Also known as Bob,” he said.Country singer Chris Janson performed his 2015 single “Buy Me a Boat,” as well as “Every Day of The Week,” on the first day. And the music video for “Trump Trump Baby” by Forgiato Blow, which was shown on the jumbotron, featured model and TV personality Amber Rose, who was also a speaker at the RNC.Over the years, some musical artists have explicitly asked the Trump campaign not to use their music at his events, including Phil Collins, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Pharrell Williams, Rihanna and more.Here’s what the RNC has been listening to:This playlist will continue to update throughout the convention."
WaPo_27,"3 takeaways from Trump’s speech, final night of the Republican convention",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/rnc-trump-speech-highlights/,2024-07-19 12:22:06.382989,,"MILWAUKEE — Welcome to The Campaign Moment. This week, we’re running through the big moments and trends from the Republican National Convention.(Did a friend forward this to you, or are you seeing this on the website? If so, sign up for this newsletter here. And make sure to check out the Campaign Moment podcast.)The 2024 GOP convention came to a close Thursday night, with former president Donald Trump formally accepting his party’s nomination just five days after surviving an assassination attempt.But even that story wasn’t necessarily the biggest of Thursday, as the potential exit of the opponent Republicans had spent four days attacking — President Biden — loomed larger and larger.Here’s our final set of takeaways from the convention week that was.1. A tale of two Trump speeches: powerful and perplexingThe first 15 minutes of Trump’s speech were powerful, as he recounted Saturday’s assassination attempt.The rest of the more than 90-minute-long speech was thoroughly confusing. It meandered between points, often going off-script with ad-libs that left a standard-issue Trump campaign speech without the kind of coherent, lofty theme that defines traditional presidential convention fare. And Trump’s initially subdued manner and calls for unity didn’t match the content of an often-divisive speech.Trump grabbed the audience with a promise to discuss what happened Saturday, but qualified it by saying he would only do it once, “because it’s actually too painful to tell.”He celebrated slain firefighter Corey Comperatore and two others who were shot.Perhaps the most powerful moment came when Trump said, “I’m not supposed to be here tonight.” The crowd began chanting, “Yes you are!” Trump ultimately responded, “Thank you, but I’m not.”“Despite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening more determined than ever,” Trump wrapped up that section. “I am more determined than ever. So are you. So is everybody. … Our resolve is unbroken, and our purpose is unchanged.”Also unchanged: Virtually the rest of his speech, undifferentiated from a normal Trump stump speech.Despite the call for unity, Trump soon referred to “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” repeatedly cited false allegations of stolen elections, called for the firing of the head of the United Auto Workers, cited the “China virus” and the “invasion” at the Southern border. He called a Democratic senator a “total lightweight.” He even repeated a puzzling allusion to “the late, great Hannibal Lecter,” from “The Silence of the Lambs,” which he’s used before.All of it was familiar from Trump’s speeches — as was the extensive ad-libbing. But this wasn’t just any Trump speech. This was a different venue, his introduction to many more casual voters who might not eat up his many musings.The assassination attempt probably drew even more eyeballs to him, and it’s not clear what those new viewers took away, beyond that Trump was nearly killed five days ago.“So I’d better finish strong,” Trump said at one point. “Otherwise we’ll blow it. And we can’t let that happen.”2. Republicans trolled Democrats on replacing BidenAs Democrats appeared to inch closer to replacing their 2024 standard-bearer, Republicans decided now would be a good time to stir the pot.Previously, some high-profile Republicans made clear their preference for facing Biden and began attacking Vice President Harris more. But Wednesday, their move was to try to stoke Democratic divisions, casting any attempt to replace the nominee as a brazen and even undemocratic one.Top Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita, at a CNN/Politico event, called it an attempted “coup” and an effort to “depose” Biden “that’s going to create a whole host of different issues.”At another event, former Trump acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell called efforts to switch nominees “outrageous” and urged the media to declare that “you don’t get to dump this [president]. This is what happens in other countries, not in America.”On X, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) labeled it an “insurrection.”None of these descriptions actually fit; Democrats are trying to persuade Biden to drop out, not overturn the primary results themselves. But as the Biden loyalists get a little quieter, there’s certainly value for Republicans in framing things this way in hopes of riling them (or perhaps even Biden) up.At the very least, Republicans seemed to be having some fun trolling Democrats over their discord.3. They leaned in on the assassination attempt — and maybe God’s favoritismTrump wasn’t the only one to focus extensively on the assassination attempt.Speakers repeatedly pitched it and Trump’s response as evidence of Trump’s resolve, courage — and possibly even God’s will that he be president.Eric Trump focused on it, calling Trump “a man who survived a bullet that was intended to eliminate him permanently from our future and from our family.”“You wiped the blood off your face,” Eric Trump said. “And you put your fist in the air, in a moment that will be remembered as one of the most courageous acts in the history of American politics.”Trump lawyer Alina Habba said Trump “did not just take a bullet in Butler, Pennsylvania. He has and will continue to take them for each and every one of us.”While other Trump supporters have posited that God intervened to save Trump, a couple of speakers seemed to go a little further to suggest it showed God’s favoritism.Evangelical leader Franklin Graham, unlike many others pointing to possible divine intervention, noted that firefighter Corey Comperatore was not spared.“I cannot explain why God would save one life and allow another one to be taken,” Graham said. “I don’t have the answer for that.”Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that he did have that answer.“When he stood up after being shot in the face, bloodied, and put his hand up, I thought at that moment that was a transformation. This was no longer a man. Well, I think that I think it was divine intervention,” Carlson said, adding: “This was the leader of a nation.”Carlson added: “I think a lot of people are wondering, what is this? This doesn’t look like politics. Something bigger is going on here. I think even people who don’t believe in God are beginning to think, well, maybe there’s something to this, actually.”"

The IDF said it increased air patrols “to protect Israeli airspace.” No siren was activated, and the IDF said the incident was under review.The military spokesman of the Houthis, a Yemen-based group that has been lobbing drones at the southern Israeli city of Eilat for months, said on social media early Friday that the group will reveal details about the “quality operation” that targeted Tel Aviv.The fatality was a 50-year-old man who was found with severe shrapnel injuries in an apartment adjacent to the blast, said Roee Klein, a paramedic with Magen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service.The unprecedented attack took place hours after the Israeli air force killed two top commanders of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon with which Israel has been exchanging fire. Israel’s aerial defense system, outfitted primarily for rockets, has for months struggled to identify and eliminate Hezbollah drones — which fly faster, lower and often in nonlinear paths — in attacks on Israel’s north.In the hours after the explosion, Israeli bomb disposal experts and rescue teams were operating at the site. Police urged residents to avoid approaching the scene and touching “rocket remnants that may contain explosives.”Tel Aviv’s mayor, Ron Huldai, posted on X that the city was on “high alert” after the drone attack and that residents were required to follow emergency instructions. “The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,” he said.It was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the U.S. Embassy branch office. U.S. Embassy officials in Israel did not respond to request for comment early Friday.This is a developing story and will be updated."

Five family members have appeared on the stage in Milwaukee this week.The family presence shows not just how the convention has become a family affair but how intertwined members of the Trump family have become with the Republican Party infrastructure, as the Republican National Committee co-chair or advisers.Each of Trump’s five children have already become minor political celebrities in their own right, and most have been heavily involved in Trump’s campaign, his previous administration or the Trump Organization. And then there were some Trumps — like the Republican front-runner’s eldest grandchild, Kai Trump — who made their national stage debut this week.The former president’s wife, Melania, and high-profile eldest daughter, Ivanka, each appeared at the convention’s closing night on Thursday, but did not speak.Here’s what to know about the Trump family members at the Republican National Convention.Trump’s second-oldest son, Eric Trump, 40, spoke at the convention Thursday night. He, like his brother Don Jr., is an executive vice president in the Trump Organization, and he has been supporting his father during the campaign, speaking at state conventions and to the media about the assassination attempt and their family.“America knows that they’re not just after you,” Eric Trump said in his remarks, addressing his dad in the audience with his take on a popular rallying cry among Trump loyalists. “They’re after all of us, and you just happen to be standing in the way.”He listed the problems he claimed a Trump presidency would solve. “Everything is unaffordable,” he said, adding: “Our infrastructure is crumbling. Our border is out of control. Millions are dead and displaced in Russia and Ukraine, a war that has no end and a war that we are funding.”Donald Trump Jr., 46, was one of the last to speak Wednesday — just before Usha Vance, the wife of vice-presidential pick J.D. Vance, and the vice-presidential nominee himself.Trump’s eldest son is a frequent proxy for his father and serves as an executive vice president in the Trump Organization.He spoke at length about the assassination attempt against his father at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and praised Trump’s reaction as a show of strength. “I’ve never been prouder of my father than I was in that moment,” he said.Donald Trump Jr.’s daughter, Kai Trump, 17, gave what her father described as her “first speech” Wednesday and emphasized what a supportive grandfather the elder Trump has been.“A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he’s still standing,” she said. “Grandpa, you are such an inspiration, and I love you. The media makes my grandpa seem like a different person.”After she spoke, her father told her, “You crushed that,” while someone in the crowd yelled “Kai 2040!”1/5Lara Trump, 41, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Eric Trump’s wife, was the first Trump family member to speak on the main stage of the convention Tuesday night.Lara Trump spoke about her father-in-law’s role as a family man who “has sacrificed for his country,” and she urged voters not to believe “some outrageous narrative about the terrible things that Donald Trump will do if he becomes president.”Notably, she gave a shout-out to “gay supporters” in her prime-time speech. The Republican Party just removed its platform’s opposition to same-sex marriage.Kimberly Guilfoyle, 55, Donald Trump Jr.’s fiancée, was one of several speakers on Wednesday to say that Trump survived his attempted assassination due to divine intervention. Guilfoyle, who is also an adviser to Trump, began her speech by saying she knows that “God has put an armor of protection over Donald Trump.”Guilfoyle railed against President Biden and Democrats, arguing that Trump supporters are “made to feel like enemies in our own country.”Notable members of the Trump family have not spoken at the convention. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, 54, and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, 42, are not on the list of announced headliners and keynote speakers, but they did appear at the convention on Thursday evening, its final night.Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, joined her father and close supporters at the convention on Thursday. Melania Trump appeared, too, wearing red and waving to supporters as she walked to take her seat with other members of the family in the VIP box.Ivanka Trump, who served as a senior adviser to her father during his presidency, said in 2022 that she would support her father outside the political arena moving forward because she wanted to preserve her family’s privacy. And Melania Trump has increasingly retreated from the public eye since the end of Trump’s presidency, though in a statement Sunday about the shooting, she praised her husband as a “generous and caring man.”Donald and Melania Trump’s son, Barron Trump, 18, is also not scheduled to speak."
WaPo_31,Fact-checking Trump on Day 4 of 2024 Republican National Convention,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/fact-check-trump-rnc-republican-convention/,2024-07-19 13:55:41.425000,,"Former president Donald Trump’s 92-minute-long speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on the final night of his party’s national convention rambled, often incoherently, through a hit parade of his favorite falsehoods, many of them ad libbed instead of drawn from his prepared remarks. Here are 34 claims that caught our attention, in the order in which he made them. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios for a roundup of statements made during convention events.“When we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to covid coming in, did a great job, never got credit for that.”Trump as president frequently touted the rise of stock prices during his presidency. The  S&P 500 index gained about 70 percent during his first term. But it has gone up 50 percent under Biden. Moreover, the record under Barack Obama beat both men.“The biggest tax cuts ever.”This is also one of Trump’s favorite falsehoods. Trump’s tax cut amounted to nearly 0.9 percent of the gross domestic product, meaning it was far smaller than President Ronald Reagan’s tax cut in 1981, which was 2.89 percent of GDP.Trump’s tax cut is the eighth-largest tax cut in the past century — and even smaller than two tax cuts passed under President Barack Obama. Trump’s tax cut was heavily tilted toward the wealthy and corporations.“The biggest regulation cuts ever.”Trump’s claim of the most or biggest regulation cuts cannot be easily verified and appears to be false. There is no reliable metric on which to judge this claim — or to compare him to previous presidents. Many experts say the most significant regulatory changes in U.S. history were the deregulation of the airline, rail and trucking industries during the Carter administration, which are estimated to provide consumers with $70 billion in annual benefits. A detailed November 2020 report by the Penn Program on Regulation concluded that “without exception, each major claim we have uncovered by the President or other White House official about regulation turns out to be exaggerated, misleading, or downright untrue.” The report said that the Trump administration had not reduced the overall number of pages from the regulatory code book and that it completed far more regulatory actions than deregulatory ones once the full data set was examined.“ ‘Right to Try’ was a big deal. We got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years.”Right to Try wasn’t a protracted battle — the idea emerged in 2013. (Trump often falsely claims it was a 45-year or 50-year battle, or as he did here, 52 years.) The initiative allowed for the use of experimental drugs, not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as a last resort for those unable to participate in clinical testing who have also exhausted all other treatment options. The FDA had already approved 99 percent of requests for access to unapproved drugs, but supporters thought these policies too restrictive.“We have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing, our people like never before.”The monthly inflation headlines are often about the year-over-year inflation rate, as measured by changes in the consumer price index. Inflation reached a high of 9 percent in June 2022. Annualized inflation has dropped significantly since then. The year-over-year figure in June was 3.0 percent — a significant drop.Inflation initially spiked because of pandemic-related shocks — increased consumer demand as the pandemic eased and an inability to meet this demand because of supply-chain issues, as companies had reduced production when consumers hunkered down during the pandemic. Indeed, inflation rose around the world — with many peer countries doing worse than the United States — because of pandemic-related shocks that rippled across the globe.Wage growth lagged inflation initially in Biden’s term, but it has since caught up. Wages have risen 19.4 percent, compared to cumulative inflation of 19.2 percent. That’s basically treading water, but it’s not as dire as Trump claims.“I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates, and lower the cost of energy. We will drill, baby, drill.”Trump has proposed a number of the policies that economists consider to be inflationary, such as a proposal for across-the-board tariffs. (Trump has thrown out a figure of 10 percent, but his staff has said the actual number has not been determined.) Trump has also suggested he would impose a 60 percent tariff on all Chinese goods. While Trump frequently claims tariffs are paid by countries, that’s wrong; the cost of the tariffs generally are passed onto consumers, so it is a form of tax.The Federal Reserve sets interest rates and Biden has respected its independence, even as it kept interest rates high to keep inflation in check. Cutting interest rates too rapidly could spark inflation.The Wall Street Journal, in its quarterly survey of forecasters this month, reported “most economists believe inflation, deficits and interest rates would be higher during a second Trump administration than if Biden remains in the White House.”It also defies economic logic to claim that higher oil production will bring prices down. Domestic oil production and natural gas production are already at record highs under Biden.“By doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down. Energy raised it.”Continuing this theme, Trump jumps the shark to claim the solution to inflation is to expand domestic oil production. Energy costs are volatile, and so many economists prefer to focus on what is known as “core inflation” — the price of goods and services excluding energy and food. That’s because energy, like food, is a staple, and demand doesn’t change much no matter the price. People generally need to keep driving cars and eating food. Oil and gas, along with some food products like pork, are also commodities and trade on exchanges, making prices subject to speculation depending on weather, wars and other unforeseen events. Egg prices, in fact, spiked as much as 230 percent in January 2023 because of the bird flu.“We’ll start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further.”Trump often has magical thinking about the national debt. When he first ran for president, Trump confidently claimed that he could eliminate the national debt — then $19 trillion — in just eight years through better trade deals. We gave him Four Pinocchios. He walked back the pledge, saying he would reduce a percentage of the debt. That didn’t happen. Instead, under Trump, the debt climbed to $27.8 trillion from not quite $20 trillion, a gain of $7.9 trillion. (More than half of the debt under Trump came in the last 10 months of his term because of the pandemic.)Running again for president, Trump now claims the debt would be reduced by money generated by oil and natural gas reserves in the ground. But most of the money is earned by oil producers, not the federal government. The federal government might own some of the land and earn leasing fees. Such fees on U.S. federal lands, federal waters and Native American lands amounted to about $20 billion in fiscal 2022, according to CRFB. The government also earns fees from taxes on sales, with a substantial portion already dedicated to transportation projects. All told, the federal government earns about $100 billion a year from fees and taxes on fossil fuel, according to a 2022 report from Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research group.The United States had a budget deficit almost four times as high — $383 billion — just in the first two months of fiscal 2024 (which began Oct. 1), showing the folly of Trump’s logic.“People don’t realize I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher.”This is poppycock. Before the pandemic, government revenue under Trump was always supposed to go up year after year, despite the tax cut. That’s because the tax cut merely slowed the growth of revenue, it did not reduce it. As predicted by congressional budget analysts, revenue went way down from what had been anticipated before Congress approved Trump’s tax cut, which (along with higher spending) was the reason the federal budget deficit soared despite a good economy – when ordinarily that would mean a reduced budget deficit“I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president and the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would have never happened if I was president.”There is no evidence that the invasion of Ukraine or the Hamas attack on Israel would not have happened if Trump had been president. In fact, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump called Russian president Vladimir Putin a “genius” and “very savvy” for advancing on Ukraine.“You got to say, that’s pretty savvy,” Trump said on a conservative talk radio show of Putin’s decision to declare certain breakaway regions in Ukraine as independent. “And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad. Very sad.” “This is genius,” Trump said. “Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine … Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.”Trump, in his speech, suggested that Iran funded the attack by Hamas but a link has not been established.“They were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us.”There is no evidence this is the case. Trump has sometimes claimed that Iran personally warned him they would attack a U.S. base and deliberately miss it. In reality, a vague warning without a target was given to the Iraqi president — and most of the missiles hit the base. No one was killed, but that was more a result of a well-planned evacuation than Iranian targeting. Despite no fatalities, many soldiers suffered serious brain injuries.“They [Democrats] used covid to cheat [in the election] and [we’re] never going to let it happen again.”More than sixty lawsuits were filed over the 2020 election, but not a single court identified fraud.“Now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened.”Trump pulled out of an international nuclear agreement restraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions that had been negotiated over many years. European allies rejected Trump’s efforts to dismantle the deal and Iran ramped up its nuclear efforts. Biden tried to resurrect the deal, but could not bring Iran back to the negotiating table.“Just a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border [in the history of our country].”Annual apprehensions at the southwest border totaled 310,531 in fiscal year 2017, which included part of the Obama administration, and that was the lowest since 1971. But then the numbers spiked in Trump’s term, reaching 859,501 in fiscal year 2019, the highest since 2009. Apprehensions plunged in April 2020 because of lockdowns at the start of the pandemic.“We had the greatest economy in the history of the world”One of Trump’s favorite falsehoods is that he created the greatest economy in U.S. history, but he amps it here to encompass the whole world. That’s ridiculous.Before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered businesses and sent unemployment soaring, the president could certainly brag about the state of the economy in his first three years as president. But he ran into trouble when he made a play for the history books to say it was the best economy ever.By just about any important measure, the economy under Trump did not do as well as it did under Presidents Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton. The gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in 2019, slipping from 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.4 percent in 2017. But in 1997, 1998 and 1999, GDP grew 4.5 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Yet even that period paled in comparison with the 1950s and 1960s. Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4 percent to 6.6 percent. In postwar 1950 and 1951, it was 8.7 percent and 8 percent, respectively.The unemployment rate reached a low of 3.5 percent under Trump, but for several months in 2023, the unemployment rate under Biden fell to as low as 3.4 percent. The unemployment rate dipped as low as 2.5 percent in 1953.“We had no inflation.”There was inflation under Trump —about 1.9 percent a year. That was pretty good but it was 1.4 percent a year under Obama.“We’ve suffered the worst inflation we’ve ever had.”Inflation under Biden has been the highest in four decades, but 9 percent is not the worst in history. It was 18 percent in 1946, more than 12 percent in 1974, more than 13 percent in 1979 and 12.5 percent in 1980. Many other years were at or near 9 percent.“Our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. And by the way, you know who's taking the jobs? The jobs that are created, 107 percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.”Trump falsely says that undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from U.S. citizens. Employment for the native-born population has increased by more than 7.2 million under Biden, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (We start from February 2021, the first full month that reflects employment under Biden.)Meanwhile, employment of foreign-born workers increased about 5 million from February 2021 through June, BLS says. The agency says this figure includes more than just undocumented immigrants; it also includes legally admitted immigrants, refugees and temporary residents such as students and temporary workers.“Under this administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent. Mortgage rates have quadrupled.”These numbers are inflated. Food prices overall have risen 21.4 percent since Biden took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data that measures inflation for dairy products, meats, and fruits and vegetables.As for gasoline, the price of crude oil was unusually low when Trump was in office because the coronavirus pandemic flattened economies around the world. After mass vaccination helped reopen many economies, demand increased again. But supply was lacking because oil producers decreased their production levels.The retail price of gasoline was $2.64 a gallon in January 2021 when Trump left office. The price of regular gasoline now averages $3.52 a gallon, according to AAA. That’s an increase of 33 percent. (On an inflation-adjusted basis, gasoline now is slightly higher than the average of $3.20 over the last 106 years.)As for mortgage rates, that is the result of Federal Reserve policy designed to tamp down inflation. But they did not quadruple. The average 30-year rate was 2.96 percent in 2021 and now is about 7 percent.“We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy.”This is false. According to the Energy Information Administration, the United States has proven crude oil reserves of 44 billion barrels, which would put the country in 10th place. Venezuela, with 304 billion barrels of oil reserves, is in first place, followed by Saudi Arabia (259 billion), Iran (209 billion), Canada (170 billion) and Iraq (145 billion). The United States ranks 4th in the world in natural gas reserves.“Under the Trump administration, just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent.”Trump claims the United States energy independent because it exported more crude and refined products than it imported. (The United States still relied on other countries for its energy needs.) The situation has not changed under Biden. In 2023, the United States imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of petroleum and exported about 10.15 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, making the United States still a net exporter.“This is the only administration that said we’re going to raise your taxes by four times what you’re paying now.”This is false. For five years, Biden has been consistent in saying he will not raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year, which leaves about the top 2 percent of taxpayers. Biden reiterated this pledge in the budget plan he released earlier this year.“I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one, thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now.”In April, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a regulation designed to promote a transition to more electric vehicles — part of a worldwide trend. The European Union, for instance, has mandated the sale of only zero-emission new cars by 2035.There is no evidence that electric vehicles will lead to the end of the auto industry. Automakers have invested billions of dollars in electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing. A report issued by the Environmental Defense Fund in August said $93 billion of announced EV investments and nearly 85,000 in announced jobs took place in the 12 months after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. In a December research report, Goldman Sachs said that as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States could be self-sufficient in EV battery production — including mining, components and battery production — by 2030.“I got rid of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made, and replaced it with USMCA, which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made.”Trump falsely suggests he significantly overhauled the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) when he replaced it with USMCA. But the new agreement only made modest tweaks to NAFTA, such as modernizing trade rules in effect from 1994 to 2020, giving some wins to U.S. farmers and blue-collar workers in the auto sector. Some elements of the deal were borrowed from the Trans Pacific Partnership, the trade deal Trump scrapped at the start of his term. The U.S. International Trade Commission, which is tasked with evaluating the impact of trade agreements, calculated USMCA would have a relatively minor impact: The USMCA would raise U.S. real gross domestic product by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent).As for NAFTA being the worst deal ever made, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded that the “net overall effect of the North American Free Trade Agreement on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,” though it noted that “there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.”“If you go back 20, 25 years, they’ve stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry manufacturing jobs.”It’s unclear where Trump gets this figure; as president he would claim the number was 32 percent, but his administration never produced a source. Millions of manufacturing jobs and thousands of U.S. manufacturing establishments have disappeared since NAFTA took effect in 1994, but it’s difficult to isolate how much of that was because of NAFTA and not other factors, such as automation. The studies we reviewed indicate NAFTA had a modest effect on the U.S. economy.“They’ve just hired, as you know, 88,000 [IRS] agents to go after them even more.”Trump made this comment after he recounted a story about a waitress complaining about being taxed on her tips. This 88,000 figure is wildly exaggerated. The IRS employees have not yet all been hired and they are not all agents.When Congress passed a bill to provide the IRS with an additional $80 billion in funding over 10 years, that money was to be used in part to hire 86,852 full-time employees in the next decade. But many of those employees would not be enforcement “agents” but people hired to improve information technology and customer service.Treasury officials say that because of attrition, after 10 years of increasing spending, the size of the agency will have grown only 25 to 30 percent when the hiring burst is complete. The administration’s strategic plan for the IRS estimated that an additional 1,543 full-time employees would be hired for enforcement in 2023, or about 15 percent of newly hired staff. That would grow to 7,239 in 2024, or 37 percent of new staff. Biden administration officials have pledged that enforcement efforts to collect unpaid taxes will concentrate on those earning more than $400,000.“I'm going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, they’re coming in.”This is false. Undocumented immigrants improve the health of Social Security and Medicare by paying payroll taxes without receiving benefits. In a fact check, we calculated the figure for Social Security payments made by undocumented immigrants is now about $27 billion. For Medicare, it should be at least $6 billion, as the Medicare tax is about 23 percent of the Social Security tax.“The other countries weren’t accepting them back. And I called up and I said, tell them that we’re not giving them economic aid anymore.”Trump told a long story about how he convinced countries that were not accepting the deportation gang members. He specifically mentioned MS-13, a transnational gang that formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s among members of the Salvadoran community who had fled violence and civil conflict in El Salvador. But he suggested the countries would not accept these gang members until he threatened to withhold aid. In his retelling, he claimed one official called him “sir” — usually a sign that Trump is telling a fable.In reality, the United States deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador years before Trump took office. From 2013 to 2018, such deportations totaled 550,186. In fact, the Obama administration prioritized the deportations of gang members and individuals with criminal records. Trump, upon taking office, scrapped that priority list and allowed officials to prioritize nonviolent immigration offenders over violent ones.“They’re coming from everywhere. They’re coming at levels that we’ve never seen before. It is an invasion, indeed. And this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them. They’re coming from prisons, they’re coming from jails. They’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums.”This is fantasy. Immigration experts know of no such effort by other countries.As someone who came to prominence in the late ’70s and early ’80s, Trump appears to be channeling Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s 1980 Mariel boatlift. About 125,000 Cubans were allowed to flee to the United States in 1,700 boats — but there was a backlash when it was discovered that hundreds of refugees had been released from jails and mental health facilities.Helen Fair, research associate at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research in Britain, which tracks the world prison population (except for a handful of countries), says the numbers keep growing. In 2013, 10.2 million people were in prison — and that had grown to 10.77 million in 2021. A preliminary estimate for February 2024, not ready to be published, indicates the population has grown even more. “In short, I would disagree with Donald Trump’s assertion,” she said.“Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up.”This is false. Violent crime rates, especially for homicide in large cities, have fallen sharply during Biden’s presidency, after a surge during the pandemic. The violent crime rate is believed to be near its lowest level in 50 years.“In Venezuela, Caracas. High crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela. Really a dangerous place, but not anymore. Because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent.”There is no reliable data on crime in Venezuela — the government stopped publishing official data in 2015 — so it’s unclear where Trump gets this number. But it’s higher than what even the government says. In May, Venezuelan security officials announced that crime indicators had fallen by 25.1 percent compared to 2023, claiming that security forces had been successful in large-scale operations against criminal groups. Some experts believe the impossible-to-verify numbers are intended to boost the sagging popularity of the Nicolás Maduro government.“We defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take five years. ‘Sir, it will take five years, sir.’ We did it in a matter of a couple of months.”It took the United States and coalition partners more than two years to defeat the Islamic State (ISIS) after Trump took office. In fact, President Barack Obama set up virtually all the structure that did the key fighting against the Islamic State under Trump, and more fighters were trained and munitions dropped under Obama than under Trump.Under Obama, all Iraqi cities held by ISIS (with the exception of the western half of Mosul) — such as eastern Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi and Tikrit — were retaken by the end of his term, as was much of the northeastern strip of Syria along the Turkish border. The basic plan of attack in 2017 was also developed under Obama, though Trump sped up the tempo by changing the rules of engagement.As for “100 percent,” that’s exaggerated. The loss of physical territory did not mean the group was defeated. In August 2019, the Defense Department inspector general warned: “Despite losing its territorial ‘caliphate,’ the Islamic State … solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria. The reduction of U.S. forces has decreased the support available for Syrian partner forces at a time when their forces need more training and equipping to respond to the ISIS resurgence.”“It began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country.”Biden essentially adhered to the timeline of withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan negotiated by Trump. The outcome might not have been much different if Trump had been re-elected and was serving a second term at the time.In March 2020, Trump approved an agreement with the Taliban (not the Afghan government) for U.S. forces to leave the country by May 2021. Despite abandoning many of Trump’s policies, President Biden decided to stick with this one, just stretching out the departure by a few months.Trump originally celebrated Biden’s decision to stick with his original plan. “Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do. I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible,” he said in a written statement after Biden announced he would continue the departure set in motion by Trump.At a political rally on June 26, weeks before the collapse of the Afghan government, Trump bragged that he had made it difficult for Biden to change course. “I started the process. All the troops are coming back home. They couldn’t stop the process,” he said. “Twenty-one years is enough, don’t we think? Twenty-one years. They [the Biden administration] couldn’t stop the process. They wanted to, but it was very tough to stop the process.”Trump’s tone changed after the Afghan military crumbled faster than intelligence officials predicted.“We also left behind [in Afghanistan] $85 billion worth of military equipment.”This is a highly inflated number for which we have previously awarded Trump Three Pinocchios. It’s not invented out of whole cloth. But it reflects all the money spent to train, equip and house the Afghan military and police — so weapons are just a part of that. U.S. military equipment was given to Afghan security forces over two decades. Tanks, vehicles, helicopters and other gear fell into the hands of the Taliban when the U.S.-trained force quickly collapsed. In 2022, CNN reported that a Defense Department report estimated that $7 billion of military equipment had been left behind.(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletterThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles"

WaPo_33,Trump recounts assassination attempt to galvanize the GOP he transformed,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/trump-republican-nomination-speech-convention/,2024-07-19 13:52:41.425000,,"MILWAUKEE — Donald Trump accepted his third straight Republican nomination on Thursday by wrapping a fresh gesture toward unity around the same dark view of American decline and loathing for political opponents and immigrants that have defined his nine-year political career and transformed the GOP.The former president dramatically recounted the experience of narrowly missing a would-be assassin’s bullet five days ago, and he opened and concluded with calls for Americans to set aside the rancorous partisan divisions he has played no small role in stoking.In between, he rehearsed his usual themes of framing this election in catastrophic terms, characterizing the current state of affairs with depictions of doom and destruction. Trump also used the banner of unity to return to form in assailing the criminal cases against him, saying the prosecutors should drop the charges and Democrats should stop calling him a threat to democracy.He also returned to his refrain of vilifying undocumented immigrants as dangerous, describing them without evidence as criminals and mentally ill, even cannibalistic. Within a half-hour, the speech started resembling a typical rally, with ad-libbed shout-outs to VIPs and railing against subpoenas and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).Pointedly, he named President Biden only once — reflecting the uncertainty surrounding who his opponent will be, as sagging polls and fundraising concerns lead Democrats to escalate pressure on Biden to step aside.Aides and advisers said beforehand that Trump’s speech would showcase a newly heartfelt, personal and conciliatory tone, using the opportunity to reintroduce himself and redefine the race for a prime-time audience of millions. The former president said he tore up an earlier draft by campaign policy adviser Vince Haley and former White House adviser Stephen Miller to reflect a new message after the assassination attempt.Investigators have not identified a moment or indicated they have found any evidence of a political or ideological motive to the shooting, which was carried out by a registered Republican and killed one rallygoer and injured two others.Trump wrote much of the speech on his own, dictating his thoughts to speechwriters, advisers said. Still, he improvised significantly during the delivery, breaking his own record by speaking for more than 90 minutes. He added a reference to his false insistence that the 2020 election was stolen, a subject advisers have tried to limit and that was not in his scripted remarks.Advisers and allies said they viewed the speech as especially effective at the beginning and less so as it went on. Biden campaign officials were pleased to see Trump quickly revert to his usual material, which they said showed he has not moderated or changed.“Tonight, Donald Trump demonstrated once again his narcissism and dishonesty,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said, beating the spiraling Biden campaign itself to an official response. “He is a man who remains wholly unfit for the office of the presidency, both in temperament and character. His attacks on the most vulnerable and on the middle class demand that we come together to defeat him in November.”Trump began by dramatically recounted his experience of the assassination attempt, saying he would tell the story this one time only because it was “too painful to tell.”“There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side,” Trump said. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” he added, prompting chants of “Yes you are!” Trump responded, “Thank you, but I’m not.”He interrupted his speech to walk over and kiss the firefighter’s uniform and helmet of Corey Comperatore, the rallygoer who was killed while covering his family to protect them from the gunshots. He asked for a moment of silence.Trump said he raised his fist to signal to the crowd that he was okay, prompting his supporters in the arena to chant the word they already knew he had used: “Fight!” That chant, along with the image of Trump with his fist raised and blood on his face, became the signature icons of this convention. The images surrounded Trump as he spoke, and the “Fight” refrain made it into an adaptation of “American Bad Ass” performed by Kid Rock shortly before Trump took the stage.Introductory speeches from Tucker Carlson, Trump’s son Eric and entertainer Hulk Hogan echoed the dark and divisive messages of many Trump campaign events. Carlson said the assassination attempt transformed Trump from a nominee or future president into “the leader of a nation.” Hogan called the cheering crowd “real Americans” who would adopt the nickname “Trumpites” and would be “running wild for four years” when Trump is president again.Eric Trump responded to concerns about Trump’s authoritarian instincts by countering, “He is not a threat to democracy, he is a threat to those who despise our republic, many whom are bought and sold, bribed and coerced people who have never signed the front of a check and who have been dependent on the government their entire adult lives.”The roaring arena here had the feel of an Ultimate Fighting Championship match for much of the night, including Trump’s introduction by UFC President Dana White. The speech capped a week-long showcase of his fully transformed and consolidated Republican Party, culminating a stunning comeback for a former president who left the White House a twice-impeached pariah who tried to overturn his election defeat and was widely blamed for weighing down his party during the disappointing 2022 midterms.1/5Trump spoke wearing a white bandage over his injured right ear, which inspired some delegates in the arena to wear paper ear flaps in a show of solidarity.He spent the week staying in his hotel suite, meeting with some donors, former British prime minister Boris Johnson and supporters; and attending parts of each evening’s programming. His expression as he entered the arena on Monday showed visible sensitivity to the crowd’s ovation, in contrast to his typical trademark scowl or grin.A few hours before the speech on Thursday, Trump visited the Florida delegation, telling them his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), was a “superstar” and important to his future, according to people present, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. He also said that during the debate, he was repeatedly surprised because he could not understand what Biden was saying, they said.Advisers said Trump has been pleased with the week’s speeches, particularly praise from former rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Trump decided to invite Haley last weekend after initially planning to exclude her.The prime-time programming emphasized spotlighting “everyday Americans” with personal experiences to illustrate the nightly themes, coming at the expense of speaking slots for elected officials and party leaders. The speeches were consistent to the point of becoming repetitive, with no memorable performances that energized the audiences or elevated rising stars the way that Democrat Barack Obama did in 2004 or Republican Sarah Palin did in 2008.That may have been as much by design as accident, keeping Trump as the singular focus of the speakers’ and the delegates’ adulation and building suspense for his grand finale.The convention also served to showcase Trump’s transformation of the party, in policy and personality. His campaign rewrote the platform to shift from free trade to tariffs and from supporting a constitutional amendment banning abortion to letting states set their own rules, including total abortion bans. The nightly show has included a supercut of Trump dancing to “YMCA” and a hip-hop parody track titled “Trump Trump Baby.”“The convention this far has been executed pretty flawlessly, from the message discipline to the visuals,” Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita said at an event Thursday hosted by Politico.Trump’s wife, Melania, attended Thursday night, after early plans showed she would not be at the convention. She has been largely absent from the campaign trail since the launch in November 2022. Trump advisers wanted Melania Trump to speak at the convention but she wasn’t interested, advisers said.Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who served in his administration but have not been involved in the current campaign also attended Thursday."

Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport reported that a “global system failure at Microsoft” had disrupted flights there.“Our systems are currently impacted by a Microsoft outage, which is also affecting other companies,” Frontier said in an earlier post on X, adding hours later that the ground stop was lifted and operations were gradually normalizing.Businesses around the world, including The Washington Post, reported experiencing issues with Microsoft Windows overnight Thursday into Friday, with users reporting “blue screen of death” (BSOD) errors. At least some resumed functioning shortly afterward.The issues began at 5:56 p.m. Eastern on Thursday, according to Microsoft.It said the preliminary root cause appeared to be “a configuration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads” that “caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.” Azure is a Microsoft cloud computing platform.In Australia, where the outage occurred in the middle of the day, services including banking, police systems and airports were impacted, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.This is a developing story and will be updated."

his speechTrump’s acceptance of the nomination clocked in as the loudest moment of the evening at 107 decibels. Or put another way, imagine standing next to a car horn or chain saw. Take a listen yourself (but don’t worry, we didn’t make the audio that loud!)Here are three other moments that elicited some of the loudest cheers — and highlighted a GOP that has never been more firmly in Trump’s grip:After a quick introduction, Trump offered a somber recounting of the assassination attempt he survived last week — his first speech since the deadly rally in Butler, Penn. Trump and his doctors have said little about his injury or treatment in the five days since the shooting.The projectile, fired from an AR-style rifle by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, came within a “quarter-inch” of taking his life, Trump said. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” he said. The crowd responded with chants of, “Yes, you are!” Trump recalled blood pouring from his head and bullets whizzing over him, but said he “felt safe because I had God on my side.”Another raucous moment came when Trump pivoted to his criminal cases and repeated his baseless claim that Democrats are “weaponizing” the justice system against their political opponents. He seized on a federal judge’s decision this week to dismiss the case in Florida that charged him with illegally hoarding classified documents and conspiring with aides to cover up his actions — to the delight of the crowd. “The entire case was thrown out of court,” he said, “with all of that publicity, thrown out of court.”In almost the same breath, Trump called out to his wife, Melania Trump, drawing some of the loudest applause of the night. The former first lady has been conspicuously absent from major campaign events, including Trump’s debate with President Biden. She also didn’t speak at this convention after taking the stage in 2016 and 2020.By the halfway mark of his speech, Trump seemed to be losing some of the audience. After an uncharacteristically emotional start, he had veered into his standard rally fare — immigration, China and the economy — recycling lines that he’s used in speeches for months now.But he still got applause for some of his favorite campaign promises: sealing the border and drilling for oil. “At the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And we’re going to do that on day one,” he said. “And that means two things on day one, right?” he continued. “Drill, baby, drill, and close our borders.”Trump went on in this fashion for the rest of his speech, which last for more than an hour and a half.

WaPo_38,Moses Ingram and Natalie Portman spar in ‘Lady in the Lake’,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/2024/07/19/lady-in-lake-portman-ingram/,2024-07-19 16:59:02.837000,,"Cleo Johnson (Moses Ingram) makes two things clear from the start of “Lady in the Lake,” Apple TV Plus’s ’60s-era drama based on the Laura Lippman bestseller of the same name: She’s dead, and she’s angry.The object of her ire isn’t her murderer. It isn’t her crooked boss Shell Gordon (Wood Harris), a scion of the Black community in Baltimore who runs a “numbers game” and hired her to keep the books. It isn’t her husband, Slappy (Byron Bowers), an amiable comic whose dreams matter more to him than making enough money to help their sick child.No, Cleo’s wrath focuses squarely on Madeline Schwartz, nee Morgenstern (Natalie Portman), a Jewish housewife who abandons a sedate and suburban life in Pikesville with a dull husband and resentful son to pursue her dream of being a reporter — and makes Cleo Johnson’s murder, which most of 1960s America was happy to forget — her pet project.Making the murder victim your narrator isn’t exactly new; Joe Gillis did much the same in “Sunset Boulevard” back in 1950. But what sets “Lady in the Lake” apart (at first, anyway) is this explicit — and hostile — conflict over authorship between two women, both of whom are clawing, in ethically dubious ways, for control over their lives and over the story of their lives.“They say until the lion tells its story, the hunter will always be the hero,” Cleo says as the camera follows a man rowing a boat and disposing of the body that will be known (until it is identified as Cleo’s) as the Lady in the Lake. It’s easy to miss at first that the “hunter” in Cleo’s proverb refers to the reporter. But in this story about changing relations between Jewish and Black communities in the 1960s, the origins of the lottery, Baltimore history, feminist awakenings, racism, fascism, parental abandonment and disgruntled sons, the real dramatic contest is over narrative supremacy.That off-kilter setup pits two women against each other who might, in a more conventional production, have been written as allies. Or as stand-alone protagonists. This comes to feel typical of the stylish series; “Lady in the Lake” is not economical. More suggestive than precise, it makes the messier, less streamlined choice every time (sometimes to its detriment). For instance: Having established its central mystery (Cleo Johnson’s death) in a cold open of sorts, the series immediately sets to introducing another — the disappearance of a young Jewish girl named Tessie Durst.Created and directed by Alma Har’el, “Lady in the Lake” builds its world patiently, with polish and pizazz. Narrative strategies are unorthodox and wide-ranging. Parallels between Cleo and Maddie are generated via deliberately confusing and sometimes conceptually strained juxtapositions. There are flashbacks galore, and dreams. Also: sumptuously creepy shots featuring fish. Lambs, too, do more than their fair share of (vague) symbolic work, and the show at one point braids several of its bigger themes together via an extremely surprising dance number. It says something about the production’s confidence — and panoramic scope, and slightly cynical tone — that the first scene outside Cleo Johnson’s perspective begins not with Tessie (the little girl whose disappearance gets things going) but with a guy dressed up as Santa’s mailbox relieving himself in an alley before rejoining the Thanksgiving Day Parade.Splashy performances abound. Portman repels sympathy while ably channeling Maddie’s professional (and ideological) frustration — and fending off her own trauma as she tries to solve Tessie’s murder and (eventually) Cleo’s. Brett Gelman, the Marlon Brando of unappealing husbands, excels as Milton, the obnoxious, exacting spouse she abandons. Y’lan Noel brings a wry, clipped, roguish intelligence to Ferdie Platt, the Black detective who becomes Maddie’s love interest, and Jennifer Mogbock’s textured work as Dora Carter, Cleo’s longtime friend and a star singer at one of Shell Gordon’s establishments, saves a somewhat underwritten character.But the biggest surprise is Ingram, whose star turn as Cleo — in an entertaining production stuffed with loud and charming choices — is notable for its grounded brilliance and restraint. Based on a Black woman named Shirley Parker whose body was found in Baltimore’s Druid Hill Park in the late 1960s, Cleo (in Ingram’s interpretation) is reserved. Understated. Pragmatic. Tactful. She’s firm, but not a troublemaker. Unique, though not a rebel. Smart, and slowly strangling under the constraints of her life — and just barely getting by as she plans, cautiously, steadily, for better things.Cleo’s appeal grows with every levelheaded second Ingram spends on-screen, making her imminent death — the frame for the whole story — increasingly intolerable. You find yourself leaning in to make sure you don’t miss a word. Ingram’s magnetism impinges on Portman’s: Cleo’s early broadside against Maddie keeps the latter from achieving the kind of moral high ground (and narrative centrality) she would need to erase the role her ambition plays in her dedication to getting Cleo justice.Without getting into spoilers or twists, it’s safe to say that the story ramifies in gratifyingly original ways while nailing some bread-and-butter basics — especially its portrayals of Cleo and Maddie’s families and home lives. The show comes across as more curious than didactic about the many social issues it raises; whenever ethics come up, motives get murky. That balance works well, even if the antagonists in this (ostensible) two-hander barely ever meet on-screen. Clocking in at a modest seven episodes, this adaptation manages to feel both expansive and propulsive; it might not feature as many points of view as the novel, but it still feels like a page-turner.Lady in the Lake premieres July 19 on Apple TV Plus with two episodes; subsequent episodes air weekly."
WaPo_39,Russian prosecutor seeks 18 years in prison for journalist Evan Gershkovich,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/evan-gershkovich-journalist-russia-espionage/,2024-07-19 16:56:02.837000,,"After a closed trial with secret evidence, a Russian court on Friday convicted American journalist Evan Gershkovich of espionage — charges that the U.S. government said were wholly fabricated — and sentenced him to 16 years in a maximum security penal colony, according to Russian state media.Gershkovich was the first American journalist arrested in Russia since the Cold War, and his case has grave implications for press freedoms.The trial proceeded with unusual swiftness — suggesting potential developments in negotiations for a prisoner exchange. Trials for espionage in Russia typically take months.Gershkovich’s arrest in March 2023 seemed to mark a brazen new chapter in hostage diplomacy, by which the Kremlin detains foreigners on minor, or even baseless, charges to then use them to negotiate exchanges for Russians convicted and imprisoned for serious crimes in the West.Senior Russian and U.S. officials have said that talks about an exchange involving Gershkovich are underway but, according to Kremlin policy, would only proceed once the trial was over.The secrecy of the trial and arguments means that the evidence presented against Gershkovich faced no public scrutiny and may never be disclosed. The prosecution on Friday had requested an 18-year prison term on Friday, close to the 20-year maximum.Stories to keep you informed

Heat pumps, EV chargers and more: U.S. unveils $4.3 billion in local climate funds
‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped
How can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says. 
Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.President Biden said in a statement that Gershkovich was targeted because he was an American and a journalist and sentenced to 16 years despite having committed no crime.“We are pushing hard for Evan’s release and will continue to do so,” Biden said, describing Gershkovich as a “hostage.”“As I have long said and as the U.N. also concluded, there is no question that Russia is wrongfully detaining Evan.”In Russia’s highly politicized legal system, where the courts routinely are used to jail journalists, democracy advocates, human rights activists and political opponents of the government, Gershkovich’s conviction had appeared inevitable since his arrest, but supporters and friends nonetheless expressed their shock.“Russia has just sentenced an innocent man to 16 years in a high security prison,” Pjotr Sauer, a correspondent for The Guardian and close friend of Gershkovich, posted on X, formerly Twitter. “I have no words to describe this farce. Let’s get Evan out of there.”In a joint statement, the Wall Street Journal’s publisher, Almar Latour, and editor in chief, Emma Tucker, called for an end to Gershkovich’s ordeal, which began with his arrest in March last year.“This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist,” the statement said. “We will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan’s release and to support his family.”Video published by Russia news outlet Vedemosti showed the judge rapidly reading the judgment, conviction and sentence, as Gershkovich, clad in a black T-shirt, stood in a glass box in the courtroom, his head shaven.Journalists were admitted only at the beginning before evidence was presented, and at the end for the reading of the conviction and sentence. An armed security agent wearing a black face mask stood nearby.Gershkovich, his employer the Wall Street Journal and the State Department have all strongly denied the accusation that he was working for the CIA. His conviction was widely expected.The 32-year-old, who was accredited as a journalist by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg and accused of spying. He pleaded not guilty.The conviction at least opens the possibility that Gershkovich could be released if the United States can reach a deal with Russia.The second day of the trial, at the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, was moved forward to Thursday from Aug. 13 at the request of Gershkovich’s defense team, according to the court.Russian prosecutors alleged that Gershkovich was operating on the orders of the CIA, gathering secret information about Uralvagonzavod, a state-owned machine-building factory in Nizhniy Tagil, about 87 miles southeast of Yekaterinburg, which manufactures tanks for Russia’s war on Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the hearing was closed because it was a sensitive case. Russian legal rights activists, however, have reported that the number of cases closed to the public has increased dramatically since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.“You know that the charges there concern espionage,” Peskov said. “Therefore this is a very, very sensitive domain, and therefore, the judge has chosen a closed-door format,” he said during a phone call with journalists. He declined to comment on the possibility of an exchange.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said last month that the case against Gershkovich was “not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.”Fueling the sense that the result was a political inevitability, senior Russian officials immediately denounced the journalist after his arrest in March last year. Within hours, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had proclaimed that his work in Yekaterinburg had “nothing to do with journalism,” and Kremlin spokesman Peskov insisted that Gershkovich had been “caught red-handed.” Neither offered evidence.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that Russia had “irrefutable evidence” that the reporter had spied and claimed that the use of journalists as spies “at least in the Anglo-Saxon world, is a tradition.” But Lavrov also confirmed that Russian and U.S. intelligence services were in contact on the possibility of an exchange.In February, President Vladimir Putin indicated he would be willing to exchange Gershkovich for a “patriot” who had “eliminated a Russian bandit” in a European capital, an apparent reference to Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, associated with Russia’s Federal Security Service. Krasikov was convicted of murder in Germany for fatally shooting a former Chechen rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, in broad daylight in a Berlin park in 2019.Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was awaiting a response from Washington to its exchange offer. He said “the ball is in the United States’ court. We are waiting for their response to the ideas that were presented to them.”Gershkovich’s conviction is likely to have a further chilling effect on the work of foreign journalists in Russia. Many media organizations pulled their correspondents out after his arrest.Gershkovich is the first American journalist arrested in Russia for alleged spying since 1986, during the Cold War, when Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was detained by the Soviet security service. Daniloff was held for 13 days before being freed without facing trial in exchange for Gennadi Zakharov, who had been arrested by the FBI in New York for spying in a sting operation.The United Nations’ Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions this month called on Russia to free Gershkovich without a trial and to pay him compensation. It concluded that, “There is a striking lack of any factual or legal substantiation provided by the authorities of the Russian Federation for the espionage charges” against him.His arrest was “designed to punish his reporting” on Russia’s war against Ukraine, “lacked a legal basis and is arbitrary,” the U.N. working group said.Associates of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in jail in Russia in February, said that there was nearly an agreement that month on a deal exchanging Krasikov for Navalny and two Americans.That exchange probably would have involved Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year jail term in Russia after being convicted in 2020 of spying.Whelan, 54, has spent more than 5 1/2 years in prison in Russia, having been overlooked in two previous exchange deals.In his statement, President Biden said that since taking office his highest priority had been seeking the release of Gershkovich, Whelan “and all Americans wrongfully detained and held hostage abroad.”But some critics have faulted Biden for putting far more emphasis on the American WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was convicted in Moscow of drug smuggling in August 2022 and freed in an exchange that December for Viktor Bout — a convicted Russian arms trafficker.Former Marine Trevor Reed, convicted of assaulting a police officer, was freed in April 2022 in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been jailed in the United States for drug smuggling.According to his friends and family, Gershkovich, the son of Soviet-era émigrés, fell in love with Russia when he moved there in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times, a prominent local outlet that pulled out of Russia after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. He later worked for Agence France-Presse and joined the Wall Street Journal’s Moscow bureau at the beginning of 2022.He grew up eating Russian comfort food prepared by his mother Ella Milman and watching classic Soviet-era cartoons. Friends and colleagues describe his open, friendly manner, his passion for reporting and his unerring ability to connect with the people that he meets.Since Gershkovich’s arrest, the Wall Street Journal has run a campaign to keep his story in the public eye, promoting the hashtag #FreeEvan and running events such as #CookForEvan, encouraging supporters to prepare his favorite dishes and tell his story as a food enthusiast and a great cook who loves to entertain friends."

WaPo_41,"Inside Sudan, devastating warfare forces desperate choices",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/sudan-civil-war-military-rsf/,2024-07-19 18:00:02.744000,,"OMDURMAN, Sudan — Every day, fighting between the military and a powerful paramilitary group confronts Sudanese with agonizing choices.A father must decide whether to leave his other children behind and try to rescue a son trapped behind the front lines of Sudan’s devastating civil war.A doctor must choose whether to run home to rescue his parents, who had come under bombardment, or stay with the hospitalized children whose lives depend on him.An impoverished young man must weigh a militia recruiter’s promise of riches against the prospect of death in battle.Restrictions on reporting have largely obscured the catastrophic toll of Sudan’s war, abetting international neglect. But a rare reporting trip inside the country provided glimpses of fear, despair and remarkable heroism.Now in its fifteenth month, the war is getting worse. The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary is advancing, capturing more territory and displacing millions of Sudanese, in turn fueling the world’s largest hunger crisis. Famine looms. About 750,000 people are on the brink of starving to death, the United Nations says. The United States estimates the war has already killed 150,000 people.Foreign countries are taking up sides fueling the conflict, and assorted militias and mercenaries are joining the fray. The conflict in Africa’s third-largest country is spilling across the borders and destabilizing its neighbors. U.S.-backed peace talks have stalled.The war pits the RSF against the armed forces. Their respective generals — RSF chief Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, universally referred to as Hemedti, and the military’s Abdel Fattah al-Burhan — had jointly seized power from a civilian-led government then turned on each other in April 2023, sparking the civil war. The RSF has seized almost all of the gold-rich western region of Darfur and stormed into the agricultural heartlands of the south. The military holds the arid north and the fertile east along the banks of the Nile River.The military’s only major offensive has clawed back most of Omdurman, the country’s second-largest city located across the Nile River from the capital Khartoum. Life has returned to some neighborhoods, although shells still crash down, but those closer to the front line remain largely abandoned. Barricades of earth and household furniture erected by vanished residents block off streets.The headquarters of the Sudan Broadcasting Corp. is a blackened shell after a month-long battle there. Some of its offices were converted to makeshift prison cells. Knotted restraints used to tie up prisoners hang from the window bars; soldiers say it had been used as a torture center.A team of Washington Post journalists visited five Sudanese cities last month in areas controlled by the armed forces, interviewing dozens of people and chronicling their lives. Most of the interviews were conducted in the presence of military or intelligence officials, and some people were inhibited in what they would discuss.In the emergency wards, the hennaed hands of mothers fanned the twig-like ribcages of babies struggling for breath, and other parents told of sleeping children killed in their beds when artillery shells crashed into their neighborhoods. Prisoners and soldiers alike spoke of young men shot far from home, their corpses decaying in the heat, before they were flung in unmarked graves.“We’re still finding bodies inside these,” said a soldier, motioning to the blackened shop fronts of a former gold market, their brick walls collapsing into ruin. Shards of broken glass and cartridge shells crunched under his feet, along with the debris of lost lives: broken tea cups, a baby’s bottle.Here are stories of struggle amid the converging crises of health, hunger, violence and displacement, of the deceptive allure of war and the stubborn dream of peace.Ghassan Ahmed had recently finished his medical internship when gunfire erupted in Khartoum, just across the Nile River. Social media said the violence was spreading fast. He rushed to al-Buluk pediatric hospital in Omdurman, where three frightened female doctors were caring for 110 sick children.“I told the women doctors to go home, and I stayed alone,” said Ahmed, 26. “It was chaos.”Frantic families swept in to grab their children until only 30 patients were left, cases so severe they would die if they were moved, he recalled. The bombing moved closer. Ahmed barred the gates.“Some sort of missile flew over the top of the hospital. And when night came, I got really scared. You could see [tracer] bullets flying in the air,” he said. “Our house is really close to an RSF camp, and my mom called me crying to say goodbye because she thought they were going to die.”He spent the night reassuring crying children and their mothers. The next day he reluctantly handed off responsibilities to his friend Abdallah, and went home through eerily deserted streets dotted with corpses to check on his family. His mother begged him to stay, but the children needed him.For the next two weeks, he, Abdallah and a nurse were the hospital’s only medical staff. They slept when they could — but emergencies seemed to occur every hour. When a 6-year-old girl died, he and a few parents helped the mother dig the grave. And when antiaircraft fire slammed into a plane overhead, he recounted, two of them dove into the grave for cover.Another time, more than a dozen explosions rocked the hospital. “The mothers got under the beds with their children, so I had to crawl under there to give them medicine,” he said.So far, the hospital has been mostly spared. A nurse’s brother was injured in a bombing. A couple of weeks ago, a stray bullet hit a doctor in the pelvis in the courtyard. But unlike many other hospitals, the wards have not been hit by a shell.The hospital, supported by the Sudan American Physicians Association, is back up to 80 percent of its prewar capacity, Ahmed said. About a third of its patients are extremely malnourished, but aid has arrived and mortality has improved: a couple of babies die each week instead of one every day.Ahmed moves down the rows of beds, touching tiny limbs. He exudes calm; inside he’s seething. Sudan has its worst levels of hunger since records began.“If you discharge a patient today,” he said with frustration, “they will go home to starve.”Six bullets slammed into Luol Ajou before he fell to the street, he recalled, pulling up his shirt and trousers to reveal the scars, guiding a reporter’s fingers to a sharp fragment in his upper arm. “That one is still inside.”Ajou was among five prisoners, ages 16 to 20, who said they were previously members of the RSF before being captured during the battle for the Sudan Broadcasting Corp. in Omdurman. Now, they were prisoners of the military and had been brought from their detention center to be interviewed. Outside, the crackle and boom of combat in Khartoum echoed across the Nile.One 16-year-old said he originally came from neighboring Chad and was working as a security guard in Libya when he was recruited with around 300 others. Another 16-year-old was recruited by a tribal leader in Chad.  The young men slipped across the border individually before mustering with the RSF in Darfur and being taken to Khartoum in trucks, he said. (An RSF spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.)Sudan’s civil war is sucking in waves of young men from around the increasingly unstable region. Coups and corruption often mean they have no jobs and little education — except how to use a gun.Ajou, 20, was recruited from his native South Sudan when he was a teenager. He had completed four years of school before his older brother Deng, a soldier, taught him to maintain and use heavy weapons like antiaircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars.By age 15, Ajou said he was getting the equivalent of nearly $100 a month from the South Sudan army, a decent salary that helped his parents feed their family of 10. But as he neared 18, Deng warned him to leave the army or risk being sent into combat. Ajou worked odd jobs, until a cross-border trader told him last year that the RSF would pay $100,000 for a weapons specialist. It seemed like his big chance.He never got the cash.Echoing the stories of other recruits, Ajou described being taken to a building in Khartoum, where RSF commanders selected small groups of fighters for their units. He was sent to defend the Sudan Broadcasting building and promised his cash later. A terrifying month under heavy bombardment followed, he recounted. The military encircled them.One night, their commander ordered a small group to break through the lines. They tried. Most were killed. The handful interviewed by The Post were captured.Ajou said that as he had bled into unconsciousness, he’d thought about his big brother, Deng.“He told me to stay away from war,” Ajou said ruefully. “I should have listened.”The last time Hassan saw his middle son, 10-year-old Mokhlis, the boy had playfully asked his father for new clothes for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr. Hassan, 48, a powerfully built construction worker, promised to find the money. They hugged before Mokhlis returned to his aunt’s house, where he often stayed because of its proximity to his school. They expected to reunite within a couple days, Hassan recounted during an interview at a dusty camp in the eastern town of al-Qadarif, where he is now one of about 11 million Sudanese displaced from their homes.When the war came, it sliced Khartoum into enclaves. The front line snaked past Hassan’s house, and Mokhlis couldn’t come home. His parents reassured him every few days by phone that the violence wouldn’t last.Weeks stretched into months. Hassan said he had wanted to retrieve Mokhlis but worried about leaving the rest of the family behind. It had also become too dangerous for men to exit their homes. Fighters often arrested, tortured or killed men on the streets, he said. Hassan’s wife Gisma fetched the family’s food. In June, she and their 8-year-old son went out to buy provisions. They never returned.“I found them the next day,” Hassan said softly. Their blood-soaked bodies lay on the street, tangled with six others hit by a shell.Hassan’s 18-year-old daughter braved the risk of rape at roadblocks to find Mokhlis and inform him about their mother’s death in person. But her courage failed when she saw him. Her aunt did instead.Hassan’s area, meantime, was growing even more perilous, he recalled. He sent his mother and three remaining children out of town, while he stayed in their home to guard it from looters. But when they came, he was powerless to stop them.Homeless, he fled to a military-controlled area but was hit by mortar shrapnel. Soldiers dragged him to a military hospital, where doctors saved his life. A jagged scar now slices across his abdomen.It took him two months to recover, he said. He spent another two weeks hiding out in deserted homes with almost no food or water, playing cat and mouse with the gunmen and trying to sneak through the front lines.In the end, the RSF caught him, he said. They beat him for three days while they interrogated him but eventually released him because his weakened state disqualified him as a soldier. By then, he had lost contact with Mokhlis.When the generals dissolved Sudan’s joint civilian-military government and seized power in 2021, Mahmoud Abdirahman joined thousands of other young Sudanese in protest, demanding a return to democracy.Those protests paused after war erupted last year, but like so many in his generation, Abdirahman has channeled his idealism in a new direction by helping others affected by the conflict.Many Resistance Committees, which had organized the protests, have been rebranded as Emergency Response Rooms. Its activists swap information about safe routes through the fighting, source scarce medicine and find shelter for the homeless.Abdirahman, a 22-year-old economics student, now stays in the military stronghold of Port Sudan, which is swollen with displaced families. He and his friends raise money to pay the medical fees for these families and organize clothing drives and soup kitchens. There’s an uneasy truce with the authorities, although activists still get arrested sometimes.“They think we are troublemakers, so they make trouble for us,” he said, a cheeky smile on his lean face.Couriers smuggle medicine from Port Sudan across the front lines for needy families. It’s dangerous work. More than 40 volunteers have been arrested in Khartoum alone, he said.A fellow volunteer in the Khartoum suburb where Abdirahman used to live was arrested carrying several packets of medicine, the volunteer later told Abdirahman. That friend said he had been taken to, of all places, Abdirahman’s former home, which like many other private homes had been seized by the RSF. It was now being used as a center for torture and executions. He was held there with more than 50 others for a week.After his release, he sobbed as he described how prisoners were killed or died after severe beatings. He said he had been tortured with electrocution.“We had so many happy memories of our home,” Abdirahman said, tears sliding down his face. “Now people are being killed there.”Most volunteers have stories of loss or near misses.A middle-aged woman with chipped nail varnish and a sparrow-brown headscarf described hiding medical equipment from the RSF to prevent it being looted. A former IT worker in freshly pressed robes said he’d driven, shaking, between the warring sides to fetch medical supplies. A young man still too scared to speak much told of another volunteer, a friend, who died at al-Nao hospital in Omdurman on June 20 when a shell slammed into the compound, killing three and injuring two dozen.But many volunteers remain undeterred.“I still believe democracy is coming,” Abdirahman said, a mural commemorating dead protesters on a wall behind him. “After the war, we will go back on the streets and fight the winner. And we will keep fighting until democracy wins.”"
WaPo_42,Outside the perimeter,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/rnc-police-shooting-samuel-sharpe-homeless/,2024-07-19 18:00:02.744000,,"— Reported in MilwaukeeThe body had been taken away, the police and the news cameras were gone, too, and now all that was left of Samuel Sharpe’s existence were the piles of fabric and tarp he had called his home.A mile away, in the Fiserv Forum, thousands were gathered for the political convention where Donald Trump would officially accept the Republican presidential nomination, but here, Jeanne Heckenlively was keeping watch.“The police is gonna try to take this down but I won’t let them,” Jeanne, 83, said to a man who was walking by.Sam, as he was known, had lived in this back-alley encampment close to King Park on the near-west side of Milwaukee, where a dozen other tents had been recently erected on a strip of dirt and lawn. The area was littered with empty beer cans and broken umbrellas and shopping carts and an old mattress.The previous afternoon, on Tuesday, Sam, 43, had been shot and killed by Ohio police officers who were in town to assist law enforcement in Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention. A group of 13 officers had been talking on the street when they spotted two men in a standoff at the park named after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.“He’s got a knife,” one officer said abruptly, referring to Sam, according to police cam footage. “Yes, he does.”The officers shouted at Sam as they began running toward him from about 50 yards away, though it is unclear that Sam ever heard or understood their commands from that distance.“Hey!”“Stop!”“Drop the knife!”“Police!”Then five of the officers opened fire, and Sam was dead.* * *Rats crawled in and out of Sam’s tent where Jeanne was still sitting on Wednesday.Until November, Sam had lived at his mother’s home in Milwaukee. He had always been a mama’s boy, said his sister, Angelique Sharpe, and he had advanced multiple sclerosis. But Sam felt called on a mission to spread scripture to people living on the margins of society. He said it was the example Jesus had set. And so he left, Angelique said, and made the tent his home.The rodents had taken over the encampment and were terrorizing the other residents. At night, the vermin would chew through the tents, and they would crawl without fear over people who slept without a covering. Jeanne was unfazed, or perhaps resigned, as they inched closer to her arm, still bearing a hospital bracelet after she was recently beaten by a drunk man. A gash on her arm was blue and yellow from an infection.“You can’t sleep here,” a woman who also lived in the camp said to Jeanne. “The rats are going to be all over you again.”Her name was Alice Tyler, 55. She had been a home health aide before her partner developed brain cancer, and her work became exceptionally difficult after his death. Now she lived here.“You go away!” Jeanne said sharply.“I’m just telling you,” Alice said, “that you don’t know what those rats are carrying around.”Alice walked away.On the other side of a small strip of trees, Alice picked up a conversation with two men, Raheem Burks and Robert Camacho, who did not live in the camp but frequented the area to provide assistance. They had each known Sam, to the extent anyone could know anyone out here, and they were each still processing what the killing meant.Robert, who was well known among the local homeless because he often provided water and tents to those who needed them,  had known Sam to be a devout Jehovah’s Witness. Sometimes they studied the Bible together.Alice shared now that Sam had confided that he had served time in prison; in the early 2000s, when he was a young adult, he was convicted of a felony for an armed robbery. It was during those years locked up that he found guidance and focus in the word of God.“He was trying,” Alice said.“Falling is not failing, failing is staying down,” Raheem said now.“Everything became overwhelming,” Alice said.“He was turning over a whole new life,” Robert said.Alice could relate; she had been incarcerated as well, she said, and recalled the feeling of being abandoned by family, by friends, by society. Sam did not talk to other people about the private parts of his life, she said, except for his devout Christian faith. That was the light that guided him toward who he wanted to be, and that’s the person Alice knew.Sam’s father, whom he was named after, instilled the profound faith in God that Sam carried, said Angelique. The elder Samuel, who is deceased, had been drafted into the Vietnam War. His example as “a veteran who fought for our country where he couldn’t even share a water fountain with his comrades,” as Angelique said, was a point of pride for the family.Sam’s incarceration was a low point in his own life, she said, but he turned himself around.“Who gets condemnation and who gets grace?” Angelique wondered. “Look at Trump. Look at Trump. They trying to give him grace so he can be president again. Sam was 20 when this [arrest] happened.”Behind Alice, rats ran back and forth between the tents and the trees.The residents of the tent encampment walked each other through all the pressures Sam had faced in the days leading to the altercation with the other man, whose name they said was Antonio.Rat poison had recently made Sam’s dog sick, which weighed heavily on him in the final days of his life, according to other residents of the encampment.He was also increasingly concerned about his own safety. Sam had even called his mother and sister in distress about the man, who had threatened to kill him and his dog and to set his tent on fire. Sam had started talking to himself more than usual.A heat wave had hit Milwaukee, bringing temperatures into the 90s, putting everyone on edge and making the rats more aggressive.“This guy was irritating him and bothering him. He was picking and nicking, and he had to defend himself. This guy was more aggressive than he was,” Alice told Robert. “He felt like he had to defend himself. He was 115 pounds, wet. He had health issues.”Behind the trees, Jeanne was still sitting, looking around Sam’s tent.Jeanne recalled that he had invited her to sleep on the old leather couch in front of his tent because she did not have one of her own. He had placed it there to block the wind.“I don’t think anybody is going to show up,” Jeanne said, although she wasn’t sure who she was waiting for.* * *Modern political conventions officially kick off presidential general elections in America. Really, though, they are spectacles that largely exist specifically to elicit media coverage. Journalists and political elites dutifully flock to convention cities where they sequester themselves within a heavily guarded perimeter. There they interrogate the candidate’s message, assess the mood of party leaders and debate how one party’s unity will fair against the other party’s fissures.Outside the perimeter in Milwaukee — where the security stakes were heightened after the assassination attempt against former president Trump — everyday residents groused about disrupted bus routes, small tips on large checks and nightmarish traffic obstructions.The tent city where Sam lived wasn’t just outside the perimeter of the convention. It was outside the perimeter of society.That out-of-town police officers had been nearby at all was baffling to many residents of the area, who expressed disbelief after the Milwaukee Police Department defended their actions. “This is a situation where somebody’s life was in immediate danger,” Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman told reporters, adding that the officers were assigned to the area in case of protests. “These officers who are not from this area took upon themselves to act to save someone’s life today.”Robert, who worked with homeless around Milwaukee, recalled that there used to be many tents at MacArthur Square, just south of the Fiserv Forum.As the city prepared for the convention, he recounted, they had gradually pushed the homeless further and further outside of the convention’s perimeter. And in displacing many of the homeless, they created new tent encampments with people who did not know each other.“The thing I can’t understand is why they had Ohio police here when this is the city of Milwaukee,” said Robert. “They should have had the outside police at the Fiserv Center and not here. The city protects the city.”“They could have used their damn Taser thing,” Alice said.“I understand that but they were policing,” Raheem said, turning heads.Raheem Burks, 54, sometimes volunteered as a security guard at the nearby social services organization called Repairers of the Breach. He met Alice there, and they became friends. Now he stopped by to check in on her from time to time.“Okay, stop, because you said one word too many,” Alice said. “You make it look like they had a right to be out here shooting.”“I’m not saying the whole thing, shooting the dude, was right. What I’m saying is they’re authorized to do it,” Raheem said.“They here visiting,” Alice said of the police. “Take your a-- over there where Trump at. What you doing over here shooting people?”* * *Elsewhere in Milwaukee, Sam’s family was grappling with his death, too. Police had shown up at Sam’s mother’s house with a photo of him hooked up to a ventilator, asking for a positive identification.Police said they recovered two knives from the scene. People at the tent city agreed Sam had the knives for self-defense. His family and friends were braced for the assumptions that would circulate online after a Black man was shot by police.“We live in a country where everyone is toting around guns supposedly to protect themselves but Sam can’t carry a knife when someone is threatening his life?” fumed Angelique, Sam’s sister.Jeanne was still sitting in front of Sam’s tent by the end of Wednesday afternoon when another family member of Sam’s walked by and introduced herself. She was looking for some answers about what led Sam to pull a knife on someone. It seemed so unlike him.“He was the kind of person that took care of people,” Jeanne told her, not answering her question about whether she knew what happened. “I thought it was this other guy who beat the s--- out of me; he’s the one they should have shot.”The look on his family member’s face showed resignation; she wasn’t going to get answers here.Downtown, a vigil was being planned for the next day by activists who wanted to call attention to the shooting, which some referred to as “the next George Floyd.”On the corner where Sam was shot, a makeshift memorial of flowers, notes and protest signs was forming.Here, in the alley where Sam lived, the news cameras were gone and not coming back, and all that was left of him was his tent.Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report."
WaPo_43,Election officials frustrated Trump allies suddenly care about rhetoric,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/republicans-rhetoric-shooting-blame/,2024-07-19 18:00:02.744000,,"MILWAUKEE — Soon after Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt, many of his prominent supporters placed blame not on the gunman who pulled the trigger but on President Biden, other Democrats or journalists who have described the former president as a threat to democracy.Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) claimed that “Joe Biden sent the orders” because the president said days earlier that “it’s time to put Trump in a bull’s eye.” Kari Lake, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arizona, said the shooting followed an “eight-year smear” campaign by journalists. And Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) said Biden’s words portraying Trump as a fascist “led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.” Two days later, Trump named Vance as his running mate.Trump didn’t go as far in his Thursday night speech accepting the Republican nomination, but he accused Democrats of trying to “demonize political disagreement” and called on the party to stop “labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy.”“I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country,” Trump said.As comments like those from Collins, Lake and Vance spiraled across the internet, many election officials watched with incredulity and frustration. For years, they felt ignored as they described how Trump’s relentless verbal attacks on the nation’s election systems and those who run them resulted in threats of violence and terrorizing harassment. Now, Trump’s prominent supporters were paying attention to the potential ramifications of rhetoric but without acknowledging how their words had contributed to the nation’s toxic divisions.“The hardest thing to swallow is how suddenly the tables have completely turned and there’s no accountability for the comments that have opened the door for so many threats in the past several years,” said Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D), who has experienced threats and has helped train and equip election officials to respond to violence.Two Republicans who help run elections in Arizona expressed disbelief as members of their party sought to blame everyone but themselves for the combustible political environment.“The same people who are deflecting and projecting are the same people who have been fanning the flame of extremism,” said one Republican, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “They project that message to their followers — without any, any, any recognition that their guy has really been the worst actor in all of this.”An expert who works with hundreds of election officials from around the nation described the moment as Orwellian, with those who spent years attacking democratic institutions now warning of the dangers of extreme rhetoric. The expert spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sentiments often privately conveyed among election officials since the shooting at Trump’s rally Saturday.Since the 2020 election, investigators and prosecutors have cited rhetoric from the right for allegedly motivating attacks and threats that have sent some election officials into hiding and prompted others to institute serious security measures, including arming themselves. Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed the 2020 election was stolen, an assertion that many of his followers believe. In December, fewer than a third of Republicans believed Biden’s win was legitimate, according to a poll by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland.Even those who fill election jobs that once drew little attention — like truck drivers who transport ballots or workers who test election equipment — are under the magnifying glass by fraud-hunting MAGA Republicans inspired by Trump’s false claims that the last election was stolen from him. The realities of their experiences are frequently brushed aside or ignored by many of the same Republicans who were quick to blame rhetoric from the left for the attack on Trump.Some of those vilifying Democrats for their language for years have engaged in incendiary talk. Collins — who blamed Biden’s “bull’s eye” comment for the assassination attempt — posted a video on social media in January 2022 that featured him holding a rifle and explaining why he believes Trump, not Biden, won Georgia in 2020.At the end of the video, Collins fires the gun at what’s labeled a voting machine and says: “Send me to Washington. I’ll fix this election. I’ll get to the bottom of 2020. And I will fight for Trump’s America First agenda.” A spokesman for Collins did not respond to a request for comment.Lake, one of nation’s most outspoken election deniers, still hasn’t accepted that she lost Arizona’s 2022 race for governor, and she continues to baselessly accuse election officials of costing her a victory. Those officials say they have received numerous violent threats. This spring, Lake told supporters to get ready for an “intense” election as she runs for the Senate.“We are going to put on the armor of God. And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of us just in case,” she said in April, as the crowd roared in approval. Earlier in the speech, she said she expected her supporters would be “ready for action,” particularly because so many of them were veterans or had law enforcement backgrounds.In a statement, the Lake campaign stood by her criticism of Democrats, The Post and other media outlets and said she “has never advocated for political violence and is focused on unifying Arizonans.” Lake rejected the idea that Republicans need to change their tone in an interview this week with a British journalist, saying, “I actually think the tone has always been good.”Vance, once a Trump critic, embraced the former president when he ran for the Senate and latched on to his false claims about elections, suggesting he would not have certified the 2020 results if he had been vice president. He has contended that rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were unjustly prosecuted, and in 2021, he said conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was a “far more reputable source of information” than MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.A spokesman for Vance declined to comment. Vance, in his speech Wednesday accepting the Republican nomination for vice president, praised Trump for calling for unity after the assassination attempt even though his opponents had called him an authoritarian who had to be stopped. A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold (D) said calling out election conspiracy theories is not partisan and is not responsible for political violence. The secretary’s office said the FBI notified it in the spring that the agency is investigating at least 10 cases involving threats against Griswold.“It’s a false equation,” she said, “to say that standing up against attacks against democracy and providing some type of accountability for lies is the same thing as a call for violence. It is not.”The Republican comments about how elections are conducted have come as many election workers have fielded volumes of harassing and threatening phone calls, emails and social media posts, many cloaked in anonymity. Some of the messages call for public executions of election workers. Others accuse them of being unpatriotic or treasonous simply for doing their jobs. The hostile environment has prompted many election workers to leave their posts. Many who remain have come to view the treatment as routine.“Our election officials have experienced the consequences of the violent and threatening rhetoric that Trump and his followers have been spewing for years,” said Norm Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House of Representatives’ first impeachment of Trump. “They receive threats, they can’t do their jobs — many have left their jobs. False claims are made about them on a regular basis.“All of this is the direct result of this climate of intimidation that Trump and those around him have created. And they are experiencing this moment as one of hypocrisy and gaslighting — although, like all of us, they condemn the shooting.”Some Republicans have “been in denial about the reality” of the consequences of their rhetoric, said New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver (D).“They’ve seen it as a political tool to get the base riled up … and enthusiastic,” she said. “And frankly, it’s created a monster — and so here we are.”Election officials worry the assassination attempt could inspire other violent acts. Some are quietly reassessing their security plans while holding no expectations that the climate will improve in the near term.“Maybe this will be a wake-up moment for everyone to realize that this isn’t the kind of society that we want to live in,” said Scott McDonell (D), the county clerk in Dane County, Wis. “My fear is that people may calm down for a little bit, but then return to where it was before.”"
WaPo_44,Celebrities keep ‘retiring.’ We sort the quitters from the fakers.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/07/19/ellen-degeneres-lizzo-kanye-retire-quit/,2024-07-19 17:59:02.744000,,"In Hollywood, where retirement is less of a life decision than a passing phase for some, Ellen DeGeneres has been remarkably consistent about her plans to quit entertainment forever.She pulled the plug on her long-running talk show in 2022, after a toxic workplace scandal tarnished her image. She is now doing one last comedy tour for Netflix, literally called “Ellen’s Last Stand … Up.” On a tour stop in California this month, DeGeneres reiterated to the crowd, “This is the last time you’re going to see me. After my Netflix special, I’m done.”And yet, they still doubt. A fan at the same show asked DeGeneres if she planned to return as Dory in a “Finding Nemo” film, so the legendary comedian resorted to baby talk: “No, I’m going bye-bye, remember.”If no one believes her, it may not be her fault. The history of the U.S. entertainment industry is replete with cases of celebrities announcing they were quitting the industry, only to go back on their word.The rapper formerly known as Kanye West — who won 24 Grammys before torching his reputation with antisemitic rants in 2022 and has announced three new albums since then — appeared to declare his retirement in a screenshot of a text conversation posted online by Ye’s musical collaborator, Rich the Kid, on July 9.
“I am retiring from professional music,” Ye allegedly wrote, as Rich tried to talk him out of it. “Not sure what else to do.”
Psych. Rich the Kid posted minutes later that he was releasing an album featuring Ye. The same day, it was announced that Ye would release a song with the rapper Consequence on July 12. It’s unclear if the texts about quitting were faked to build hype for the releases; Ye’s people did not reply to a request for comment.

But on July 10, Sajak was confirmed as a host of ABC’s “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” which premieres in the fall. Kellyn Holmes, a senior publicist for ABC Entertainment, said this will be Sajak’s last season hosting the game show. The number of episodes he will appear in has yet to be determined, she said.
Verdict: Sajak’s retirement has ended, albeit briefly. We are unsure how many episodes his “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” run will include.

Cena, a professional wrestler turned actor, announced July 6 that he would be retiring from the not-quite sport.
Then he added that he would wrestle 30 to 40 mores times throughout 2025. Oh, and Cena will continue to work alongside WWE when his career ends, though not in a wrestling capacity. “People say they’re walking away, and two years later they come back. I want to set the record straight right now. I’m done. This is it,” Cena said at a WWE press event. “Part of this business plan that I proposed and they accepted was me remaining in the WWE family in some capacity for an extended time to come.”
Verdict: He is retiring from in-ring competition, but he will still act in movies and television shows, and potentially show up on WWE’s television products as a “behind-the-scenes” character. And if he ever does decide to hop back in the ring, he wouldn’t be the first wrestler turned actor to do so.Okay, this one is a bit messy if you’re not a wrestling geek (like this reporter).

“I am so filled with joy and contentment today as I live out my vision. Praise God, I feel so grateful for my blessings,” she wrote on Instagram. “Stepping away from what seems like the obvious choice (wealth and fame) can feel scary at times, but stepping into your dharma replaces the fear with fulfillment.”
She added that she “might return to Hollywood one day, but, for now, this is where I belong.”
Verdict: Not clear. Lilly has stepped away before, after her run on “Lost” wrapped up in 2010. It wouldn’t be surprising for her to fade into the background before resurfacing in another “Avengers” movie.Lilly, star of “Ant-Man and the Wasp” and the 2004 hit show “Lost,” announced June 3 on her Instagram that she would be taking a break from acting.“I am so filled with joy and contentment today as I live out my vision.

Her Instagram post was mostly spent venting her frustrations over becoming “the butt of the joke every single time because of how I look,” concluding simply, “I didn’t sign up for this s--t, I QUIT.”
Days later, Lizzo clarified in a video that “when I say ‘I quit,’ I mean I quit giving any negative energy attention.” She added: “What I’m not going to quit is the joy of my life, which is making music, which is connecting to people.”

The ’90s pop icon wrote in an Instagram post: “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash !!! They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry !!!”
So far, Spears has held true to her word, but her decades-long relationship with the music business has many fans doubting that they won’t reconcile. Spears released a song called “Hold Me Closer” with Elton John in 2022, which was her first released track since the end of her conservatorship. She also had a track with Will.i.am called “Mind Your Business” in 2023. So new music isn’t entirely out of the question for her, right?
Verdict: Unclear. It seems Spears has nixed the idea of a new album, though new music might be possible. As her memoir proved, she has a lot of songwriting material if she wants to return to music.In January, a fired-up Spears denied certain tabloid reports that she was working on a new album.The ’90s pop icon wrote in an Instagram post: “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash !!!

The comedian released a long statement to the New York Times in late 2017, a day after the newspaper published the accounts of several women who said he took advantage of them.
“These stories are true,” the message began, and ended with a promise to “step back and take a long time to listen.”
Who knows what Louis C.K. considers a “long time,” but he returned to the stand-up comedy scene less than a year later and has since seemed to have revived his career, selling out theaters and becoming the subject of multiple documentaries.
Verdict: #MeToo accusations derailed the careers of many celebrities and Hollywood bigwigs, but as Louis C.K. proved, that doesn’t mean they’re gone forever.It would be hard to count all the celebrities who have slinked away from the limelight after being accused of sexual misbehavior in the #MeToo era, but Louis C.K.’s mea culpa stands out.

And hello and good day. Letterman got his own Netflix series two years later and even stopped by “The Late Show” in 2023. His series, “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,” has had two episodes in 2024 so far — one with Charles Barkley, the other with Miley Cyrus.
Verdict: Letterman is no longer retired and has shown a willingness to stop by Hollywood on occasion. How long he chooses to do so is another question entirely.Like DeGeneres, David Letterman was pretty blunt when he announced his retirement in 2015. “For the last time on a television program, thank you and good night,” he said on his final episode of “The Late Show.”And hello and good day.

You know how this ends: Three years later he released the album “Kingdom Come” and has since released four more, as well as a handful of features.
In 2022, Jay-Z reflected on his inability to retire in an interview with Kevin Hart. “I tried that. I’m terrible at that,” he said. “I just needed a break. But I really thought that I was really burned out at the time.”
Verdict: Jay-Z could probably afford to retire any time he wants, but he doesn’t seem ready to do so yet.One of the more notable “I’m retiring but not really” moments came from the rapper Jay-Z, who said in 2003 that he was done making music.

In December 2013, he announced on Twitter that he was retiring, the night before his movie “Justin Bieber’s Believe” hit theaters. But Bieber didn’t stay retired for long. Since 2013, he has released three albums (2015’s “Purpose,” 2020’s “Changes” and 2021’s “Justice”) and had some pop-charting singles, including “Love Yourself,” “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?” His appearance on the remix of Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito” led to the hit being a 2017 song-of-the-summer contender.
However, in June 2022, Bieber announced he would take another break from music as he contended with a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. One month later, he began touring again. The tour, which stretched across Europe, “took a real toll” on him, Bieber said in a social media post at the time.
In February 2023, he canceled his “Justice World Tour” dates and seemingly disappeared from the spotlight.
But Beliebers found new hope when the singer posted several photos in January, one of which showed him with a microphone in a studio. He also appeared to include a snippet of a new song in a post in May.
Verdict: We somehow doubt Bieber will remain out of the radio playlists much longer.Bieber has had a complicated relationship with his career.

The tour, which stretched across Europe, “took a real toll” on him, Bieber said in a social media post at the time.In February 2023, he canceled his “Justice World Tour” dates and seemingly disappeared from the spotlight.But Beliebers found new hope when the singer posted several photos in January, one of which showed him with a microphone in a studio. He also appeared to include a snippet of a new song in a post in May.Verdict: We somehow doubt Bieber will remain out of the radio playlists much longer.Two later entries to our list are Adele and Trixie Mattel, who both announced this week that they are feeling burned out and need to step away from the spotlight.
Adele specifically said her “tank is empty” after completing a two-year residency in Las Vegas. Trixie Mattel, a star of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” who has been running a YouTube channel in addition to other television appearances, announced a three-month break and teased “a complete reboot” after what Trixie described to be a difficult year.
So, expect to see Trixie back in the spotlight in the fall. As for Adele, she’ll probably be hanging at Los Angeles Lakers games beside her partner Rich Paul, a longtime associate of LeBron James. Sure, she may not perform new music, but she will probably be on screen.Two later entries to our list are Adele and Trixie Mattel, who both announced this week that they are feeling burned out and need to step away from the spotlight.Adele specifically said her “tank is empty” after completing a two-year residency in Las Vegas.

WaPo_46,How the nation’s driest state is using cash to free up water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/19/water-rights-nevada-pilot-program/,2024-07-19 17:59:02.744000,,"EUREKA, Nev. — Denise Moyle was a no. Her sister Dusty was a no. Their father was against the idea, too.None of them wanted a part of Nevada’s first-ever proposal to buy farmers’ water rights in parts of the state where people are draining the aquifers. Nevada officials expected it would draw skepticism. In a state known for being the driest in the nation, selling your water has historically meant quitting agriculture. It meant letting your land go dry, inviting erosion, dust storms and invasive weeds. It meant being a bad neighbor.“You start from a gut reaction: ‘No, I’m not selling my water,’” said Denise, 47. Raised with her two sisters on her parents’ alfalfa farm in central Nevada’s remote Diamond Valley, she grew up understanding that water was crucial. “We’ve been programmed our whole lives that the water is the only value the land has,” she said.But Deanne Moyle-Hicks, the eldest Moyle daughter, thought differently.“Step back and look at it from a business perspective,” she told Denise. “What would you do with the land if you couldn’t farm it?”As the only state in the Great Basin that doesn’t use Colorado River water for agriculture, Nevada’s farmers rely on groundwater wells. Yet many of the state’s aquifers are shrinking, threatening its cattle ranches and its cash crop, alfalfa hay, which helps feed California’s dairy cows. Groundwater is vanishing all over the country — the result of decades of excessive use and climate change-fueled drought. In some states facing severe groundwater decline, officials are beginning to penalize over-pumping or ordering farmers to stop irrigating because conservation alone won’t be enough.Nevada’s approach is more carrot than stick. With $25 million in federal pandemic aid, state officials decided to run a one-time test of whether farmers would be interested in selling all or a portion of their legal rights to draw groundwater. They focused on Nevada’s most depleted basins, where over-pumping is emptying rivers and threatening future crops.By this spring, they had their answer: There were more applicants than money to pay them. Farmers and ranchers offered to sell $65.5 million worth of water rights, more than two-and-a-half times the available funding.“We have been blown away by the level of engagement and interest,” said Peter Stanton, executive director of the Walker Basin Conservancy, a nonprofit that works to reverse the decades-long collapse of Walker Lake, located southeast of Carson City. The Northern Paiute people call it Agai Pah, which means “trout lake.” But decades of farms and ranches gulping water from the lake’s headwaters have left it depleted, with saline levels too high to support fish.The conservancy got $4 million from the state to buy water rights from willing sellers, Stanton said, and it had nine times that level of interest. In the Walker Basin alone, multiple people applied to sell more than $4 million worth of groundwater rights.“People want to participate in this,” Stanton said.Among those drawn to the state’s offer were Deanne and Denise Moyle.Last month, the sisters stood on the edge of one of their fields and pointed out the wells they planned to sell. Together, they own a portion of their family’s farm, which has expanded from the 320 acres their father bought in the 1970s to roughly 5,000 acres today. Deanne’s deaf chihuahua, Penny, set out and appeared to vanish amid a green oasis of alfalfa that put the distant arid mountains in stark relief. Across the valley, farmers were running their pivot irrigation systems all day and night, pumping millions of gallons of water out of the ground.By giving up even a fraction of their water rights, the sisters were placing a big bet on the future, and on themselves.“Will it hurt in the long run?” Denise said. “It’s hard to predict.”Nevada’s groundwater crisis began more than four decades ago, when state officials overestimated the size of the state’s aquifers and gave farmers rights to water that didn’t exist. When people ask Jeff Fontaine, the executive director of the Central Nevada Regional Water Authority, why the state should spend taxpayer dollars to buy out water rights, he starts the story here.“We knew a lot of people moved to Nevada to farm, but we didn’t really think that many people would be successful or use their full allocations,” Fontaine said. “They didn’t have the scientific understanding we do today.”Today, Nevada is estimated to have about 2 million acre-feet of groundwater — and it has given water users the right to pump 3.5 million. One in five of its groundwater basins are being pumped faster than they can be replenished by precipitation. A study by the Nature Conservancy of over 6,500 Nevada wells found that 39 percent have significantly declining groundwater level trends, a sign of widespread overuse.In Diamond Valley, where the Moyles live, the situation became so dire — the aquifer is over-pumped by more than 160 percent — that wells dried up and farmers had to drill deeper, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to chase the water. In 2015, the state engineer ordered water users to come up with a plan to collectively reduce their consumption or face cuts according to the seniority of their rights. A majority agreed to spread the pain by voluntarily lowering their water use over the next 30 years to stabilize the aquifer.The high cost of drilling deeper wells, combined with the pressure to conserve and the ever-present threat of cuts is why, when the state announced its cash-for-water offer, most of the demand came from Diamond Valley.“Folks here see the writing on the wall,” said Jake Tibbitts, natural resources manager for Eureka County, which encompasses Diamond Valley. “We know there’s no math equation that will work unless some lands come out of production.”Tibbitts said many applicants plan to continue farming. They didn’t put all of their water up for sale, choosing instead to hold back their most senior rights or their most productive wells. Those farmers have options: they can fallow some fields, turn them into dryland pasture for cows, horses and sheep, or experiment with crops that thrive on less water. Those planning to sell most of their holdings are typically older, Tibbitts said, without children or grandchildren who want to take over the family farm.Solar developers are also sniffing around the valley, offering to lease farmland in anticipation of major transmission lines being built some day.Billy Norton, 64, said the state’s offer would equal as much as nine years’ worth of savings — a deal too good for someone nearing retirement to let pass. He is holding back enough water to graze cows on his property; the rest of his water rights will be permanently retired.“Was I totally excited about it? No. And even today I’m not. But I do feel it’s the right decision,” Norton said. “It’s a wonder that we’ve been able to go this long with over-pumping like we have in this valley.”Russell Conley, a farmer in the valley, said the state’s offer was attractive to his parents, who wanted to devote more of their attention to their cow-calf operation. But while they are selling, Conley said he is not ready to give up his water rights.“I still like doing this. This is still my passion,” he said, adding that he is banking water and fallowing land to prepare for a future in which he needs to draw on those reserves. If all goes according to plan, he said, he should be able to keep growing alfalfa in the high desert for the next 25 years.It’s not just Nevada trying to buy back groundwater rights to correct years of unchecked pumping. Similar strategies have been attempted in Kansas and are being used in Colorado, where residential development, farming and reduced rainfall are straining groundwater supplies.Two years ago, Colorado lawmakers set aside $60 million to retire groundwater wells used to irrigate farmland in the San Luis Valley, in the south-central part of the state, and the Republican River basin, near the eastern border with Kansas. But growers there have been less interested in the program than their counterparts in Nevada. After offering to pay water users $3,000 per acre-foot to permanently retire their irrigation wells, officials in the San Luis Valley agreed to compensate them for partial reductions in pumping.Dan Waldvogle, former director of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, said few Colorado farmers who count on groundwater are interested in cashing out, shutting off their pumps and trying to farm by relying on rainfall alone.“Agriculture is such a huge driving economic force that supports everything from main street to schools to all of the ag support businesses,” he said. “If you just do full dry up, it has really big impacts on the community.”As aquifers dry up and droughts intensify, the nonprofit Colorado Open Lands is trying to use conservation easements to preserve water and help families facing difficult decisions about whether to continue farming. Known primarily as a route to land preservation, conservation easements are a legal mechanism that allows families to stay on their land, lower their taxes, and receive compensation for reducing their groundwater use — or stopping pumping entirely.The group has completed one agreement, paying a farmer to stop irrigating his 1,800-acre farm in the San Luis Valley. Sally Wier, a conservation project manager for Colorado Open Lands, said the idea is that by reducing consumption voluntarily, farmers can prevent painful cuts that might lead them to abandon rural communities. According to supporters, the U.S. Agriculture Department is considering experimenting with this approach for farmers who tap the dwindling Ogallala Aquifer, which runs through eight Plains states. A USDA spokesman declined to comment.But groundwater easements haven’t soared in popularity, Wier said, because of disagreements over payment.“We don’t have a playbook right now in the West that says this is the value of water,” Wier said.As Nevada tries to pull back on excessive groundwater use, farmers who have agreed to sell their water rights are waiting for the deals to close later this year. Then they have to decide what to do with their land — and what to do with the money.“We could pay down some debt, buy some equipment, maybe buy another business,” Denise Moyle mused several months ago. She didn’t ponder the question long — in June, her family purchased a feed store in Reno, giving them more control over how their products are sold and distributed. They would fallow some of their land, but most of it would stay in alfalfa.When she imagines the future of Diamond Valley, Denise said she pictures land still covered in green crop circles. Between the local farmers’ hard-won plan to reduce pumping and the state’s buyback offer, she was confident the next generation of her family could succeed at farming.But it’s not the valley of today she’s envisioning. It’s the land of 50 years ago, when her father arrived.“There were about half as many farms as there are now. There were still people taking brush out,” she said. To protect the aquifer, and allow those who want to farm to continue, “that’s about where we’ll need to get,” she said."
WaPo_47,Biden may endorse big Supreme Court reform. It would be a major shift.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-supreme-court-reform/,2024-07-19 17:59:02.744000,,"President Biden is seriously considering endorsing a set of proposals that would reform the Supreme Court, including legislation to establish term limits and impose a binding code of ethics on the justices. It is a major shift for Biden, a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman who through his long political career has generally opposed attempts to make substantive changes to the high court.Biden is also weighing whether to call for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other constitutional officeholders.Each of the proposals would face steep obstacles in a deeply divided Congress. While many Democrats and some outside experts say there is enough evidence of ethics breaches by the justices and partisan activity around the court to warrant reform, many Republicans say those critics are simply unhappy with the court’s strongly conservative decisions.It is for that reason that retired federal judge Thomas B. Griffith, who served on a bipartisan commission appointed by Biden that studied potential changes but did not reach consensus, is skeptical.“I’m suspicious of any efforts at so-called reform of the court that seem to be rooted and grounded in disappointment with decisions of the court,” said Griffith, a judicial appointee of President George W. Bush who emphasized that he had not seen any specific proposals Biden is considering.Retired federal judge Nancy Gertner, who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton and also sat on the commission, said it was “terribly important” for Biden to legitimize what she believes would be much-needed change.“We have the most powerful, least accountable Supreme Court of any Western democracy,” she said. “Now it’s up to Congress to actually go forward on the reform effort. And yes, it will be difficult, and it may take multiple sessions, but it needs to begin.”Here’s what Biden has said in the past about Supreme Court accountability and what others have proposed.Democratic calls for an overhaul reached a boiling point in 2016 after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to consider President Barack Obama’s pick to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia, citing the upcoming presidential election even though it was nearly eight months away.The seat remained empty until President Donald Trump was inaugurated 10 months later. He nominated Neil M. Gorsuch, maintaining the court’s 5-4 conservative split.Democrats were equally enraged when McConnell went on to push Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination through just two months before the 2020 presidential election. Biden, then the Democratic nominee, pleaded with Senate Republicans to wait until the winner of the election was inaugurated. But Barrett was confirmed as the successor to the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Oct. 26, eight days before the election, creating a 6-3 conservative supermajority.Despite growing calls for reform from members of his party, Biden told Iowa Starting Line in 2019 that he did not support efforts to expand the Supreme Court, “because we’ll live to rue that day,” he said.Three months later, during a Democratic primary debate, Biden said: “I would not get into court-packing. We add three justices; next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.”He told the New York Times editorial board that he did not support term limits, either.And he did not publicly shift from that position after Barrett’s nomination.As many as 15 other Democrats running for president in 2020 — including the current vice president, a cabinet official and two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee — either supported or said they were open to imposing term limits on the justices and expanding the court, according to a Washington Post tally that year.Pete Buttigieg, who became Biden’s transportation secretary, backed expanding the Supreme Court from nine to 15 justices. Under that plan, Democrats and Republicans would each name five justices, and those 10 would name an additional five.Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., also expressed support for term limits.“We need to reform the Supreme Court in a way that will strengthen its independence and restore the American people’s trust in it as a check to the Presidency and the Congress,” his campaign website said.Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), who oversee judicial nominations as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said they were open to expanding the court. But, like then-Sen. Kamala D. Harris, they didn’t get into any specifics of how they would do it. Booker and Harris also said they were open to imposing term limits.On Oct. 22, 2020 — the same day Republican senators advanced Barrett’s nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee — Biden announced on CBS’s “60 Minutes” that if he were elected president he would create a bipartisan commission to study the issue of making structural changes to the court.The commission submitted its 294-page report in December 2021. Members presented arguments for and against the proposals, including expanding the size of the Supreme Court, establishing term limits for the justices and imposing a code of conduct on the justices. The report did not take a position on those ideas but did note that “there is profound disagreement among commissioners” about court expansion.The commission concluded that while Congress has broad authority to establish and change the size of the Supreme Court, it would be hard to ensure that the issue doesn’t become politicized.“We were charged not with coming up with recommendations but with plumbing the issues deeply and issuing a report,” Gertner said.Griffith, who published an op-ed in The Post shortly after the report was finalized criticizing term limits and court expansion, said the proposals that Biden is said to be considering would encroach on judicial independence. “We need to be doing everything we can to preserve judicial independence and not give in to the temptation to believe that judges are just partisans in robes,” he said. “The judiciary is, in many ways, the crown jewel of our democratic republic. ... I think that’s a very dangerous path to go down.”Democratic lawmakers have held hearings, proposed legislation and introduced articles of impeachment that, in their view, would hold the Supreme Court accountable. None have gained support from Republicans, however, or seem likely to garner the votes needed for passage anytime soon.In July 2023, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to advance legislation that would impose a binding code of ethics on the nine justices. The action came after news reports revealed that Justice Clarence Thomas accepted but did not disclose decades of luxury vacations and private jet travel funded by Republican donor and Dallas billionaire Harlan Crow.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the federal courts, is the lead sponsor of the bill, known as the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal and Transparency Act. It would require the court to strengthen its recusal requirements and bring its hospitality and financial disclosure rules in line with those of Congress, among other parts of government.Whitehouse is also the lead sponsor of the Supreme Court Biennial Appointments and Term Limits Act, which would create 18-year terms, adding a new justice to the bench every two years.Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a ranking subcommittee member on the House Judiciary Committee, has introduced several companion bills in the House and the Judiciary Act of 2023, which would expand the Supreme Court by adding four seats.The Judicial Ethics Enforcement Act of 2024, introduced by Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) in April, would authorize the creation of an inspector general’s office to investigate allegations of misconduct in the judicial branch.On July 10, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) introduced articles of impeachment against Thomas and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who drew headlines this spring after reports that politically charged flags were flown on his properties. Alito, who like Thomas is a staunch conservative, has said he had nothing to do with the flags and that his wife raised them.Ocasio-Cortez said impeachment, which almost certainly will not advance, was necessary “to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court.”"
WaPo_48,"In the galleries: A tactile, textural, dynamic group exhibit",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2024/07/19/art-gallery-shows-dc-area/,2024-07-19 17:59:02.744000,,"The four participants in “Beyond Surface,” a new exhibition at Pazo Fine Art, begin with the language of painting and drawing but expand that vernacular into the third dimension. The resulting artworks may be sleek or craggy, tightly contained or free form. But all speak fluently to each other, indicating that Pazo Fine Art was astute to convene these artists, three from Washington and one from Baltimore.Both Joanne Kent and Giulia Livi draw from color field painting, yet their work is also sculptural. Kent’s rectangular pieces are essentially blocks of a single hue. The artist complicates the format by applying oil paint in thick tangles that produce swells and shallows, and sometimes by including additional shades that are close but not identical to the dominant one. The paintings’ beguiling depths are simultaneously illusory and actual.Most of Livi’s sculptures protrude about as far from the wall as Kent’s, undulating in regular curves. Made of painted tile, four of the pieces curl neatly, one into a partial tube and another whose ripples shift from pink to lilac. The other Livi creation is made of painted foam that bulges softly within its hard-edge contour. As with the Baltimore artist’s other sculptures, the effect is to freeze motion serenely in space.Both Ara Koh and Kristina Penhoet draw lines with tangled strands that appear to dangle and pool. Koh’s sculptures look like piles of ribbons whose hues become subtly darker toward the bottom of the heap. But the threads are in fact ceramic, so their seeming softness is a canny deception.Penhoet’s works, which really are pliable, are made primarily of off-white wool that’s woven and knotted to yield various thicknesses. Two of the pieces hang from ceiling to floor, evoking trees, vines or Rapunzel-length tresses while casting shadows whose movements emphasize how the fibers sway. Of these artists, Penhoet is the only one to forgo color, but she makes the most energetic use of motion.Beyond Surface Through Aug. 3 at Pazo Fine Art, 1932 Ninth St. NW (entrance at 1917 9½ St. NW). pazofineart.com. 571-315-5279.The three artists featured in African Art Beats’ “The Bright Side” hail from different regions of Africa, and employ diverse styles. But all the men, each known by a mononym, share an enthusiasm for assembling and transforming. Their work is made from everyday stuff, which is both celebrated and transfigured.Cheerful collage-paintings are the specialty of Soul (Souleymane Konaté), who depicts big-eyed people, animals and hybrid creatures. The self-taught Ivory Coast artist places his subjects amid patterns, often floral, so that the cartoonish beings appear to emerge from, or merge into, their colorful surroundings.Diamas (Serge Diakota Mabilama) takes a similar approach, but with sculptural paintings that include such recognizable objects as a pan and Sprite bottle caps. The former serves as a metallic canvas for a painting of a faceless figure, while the latter are strung into garlands that festoon another circular picture. The artist, who lives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, uses automotive varnish and found objects to craft such ironically titled pieces as “Unbreakable,” a portrait rendered on a partly broken black plate to which Diamas has playfully attached a battered spoon.More traditional subject matter is rendered with industrial substances by Doff (Apollinaire Guidimbaye), an artist from Chad who also has no formal artistic training. His search for seemingly worthless scrap materials earned him his nickname, Wolof for “fool.” But there’s nothing laughable about his relief sculptures of flowers and market scenes, interpreted with such unexpected materials as bullet casings and melted plastic. Doff’s simple imagery is deepened by its complex textures, urgent ecological implications and sheer inventiveness.The Bright Side Through Aug. 15 at African Art Beats, 3501 Lowell St. NW. africanartbeats.com. 202-766-2608.The title of Adah Rose Gallery’s “From Wood to Paper and Back Again” reflects such pieces as Jessica Drenk’s sculpture in which dozens of concentric paper layers, pressed closely together, simulate a tree trunk’s rings. The wide-ranging group show, curated by Mary Freedman and Lisa Rosenstein, includes several other works that emphasize the qualities of their materials. Among these are Rosenstein’s own oval collages made of torn paper and Christian Tribastone’s “High/Low,” which playfully elevates everyday brown cardboard by partly coating it with gold leaf.The majority of the entries, however, are simply drawings, paintings or prints, most often on paper. The representational works include Freedman’s expressionist charcoals of tulips and Nathan Loda’s realistic but slightly haunted oils of sylvan scenes; substantially more impish are Gregory Ferrand’s pencil renderings of people in Batman costumes. Floral rather than arboreal motifs are dissected and layered in prints by Susan Goldman, a silk-screen virtuoso. As naturalistic as they are abstract, Goldman’s prints shift from blossoms to geometry and back again.From Wood to Paper and Back Again Through Aug. 10 at Adah Rose Gallery, 3766 Howard Ave., Kensington. adahrosegallery.com. 301-922-0162.Local photographer Redeat Wondemu often travels home to Ethiopia, where she makes portraits of women that begin with interviews to establish a rapport between artist and subject. Wondemu takes a much less documentary approach to the self-portraits in “Phoenix Series,” six of which are on display at IA&A at Hillyer. These five-foot-high pictures feature softly defined images and stress motion over character; the artist’s face is visible in only two of the pictures, and even in those the visage is muddied and shadowy.The “Phoenix” Series photos are contact-printed from digital negatives onto watercolor paper using the blueprint-like cyanotype process. Slow shutter speeds smear Wondemu’s flowing clothing into swoops of white, suggesting a bird’s plumage. The blurred figures are framed by deep blue expanses that turn mushy around the edges, as if the backdrop is melting. The poses suggest a dance to various freedoms, including an unshackling from photographic verisimilitude. As Wondemu emulates a bird, the photos very nearly turn into paintings.Redeat Wondemu: Phoenix Series Through July 28 at IA&A at Hillyer, 9 Hillyer Ct. NW. athillyer.org. 202-338-0680."
WaPo_49,Yemen’s Houthis claim drone strike near U.S. Embassy branch in Tel Aviv,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/18/us-embassy-tel-aviv-explosion/,2024-07-19 17:58:02.744000,,"TEL AVIV — A surprise drone attack in the heart of Israel’s most populous city killed one and injured at least five people early Friday, shattering windows and setting off alarms just yards from the U.S. Embassy branch office. The Iranian-backed Houthi group in Yemen claimed responsibility for the strike, which evaded Israel’s expansive air defense network and spiked concerns of wider regional violence during the Gaza war.An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said the explosion was caused by an Iranian-made drone possibly launched from Yemen, according to early unconfirmed analysis. The IDF said it increased air patrols “to protect Israeli airspace.”No siren was activated, and the IDF said an initial inquiry pointed to “human error that caused the interception and defense systems not to be operated.” The error may have been related to “identification,” an IDF official said in an earlier briefing, saying that the matter was still being investigated.The spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, dismissed Houthi claims that the drone was a type of stealth aircraft and maintained it had been picked up by Israeli monitoring systems. A second drone targeting Israeli airspace was successfully intercepted early Friday, he said. Investigators were exploring whether the two attacks were related.The drone that reached Tel Aviv was an Iranian-made Samad-3 that had been modified to fly greater distances, he said.The Houthis, a Yemen-based group that has been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea since last year, said Friday in a statement that it had carried out a “military operation” targeting Tel Aviv that “successfully achieved its objectives,” using what it said was a new drone capable of evading countermeasures. The attack, the statement said, was in response to Israeli “massacres” in Gaza.Witnesses said they heard and saw an aircraft appear from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea around 3 a.m. and slam into a building with a loud explosion. There were no warning alarms in a city where residents are used to air raid sirens and alerts on their phones sending them to shelters.Limor Sagiv, 58, was asleep with her partner in a fifth-floor apartment less than two blocks from the U.S. Embassy facility when the blast shattered their kitchen window and a balcony door.Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.“There was an orange flash and a smell like a rubber fire,” said Sagiv, standing in a living room filled with glass shards. They had just returned to the apartment after being told by police to evacuate the area for a few hours in case of secondary attacks.Noa Yehoshua was up late with friends in a nearby apartment when one of them spotted a small aircraft with a round fuselage and wide wings.“My friend was sitting by the window and said, ‘Oh, wow, guys, what it that?’” Yehoshua said. “And then it just exploded.”Yehoshua, 23, an army reservist scheduled to deploy to Gaza next week, said the drone strike was part of the wider war with Iran-backed forces throughout the region that has raged since the Hamas raid on Israeli towns on Oct. 7.“It’s so surreal that we’re attacked over and over and over again in a war that we didn’t even start,” she said.During the war in Gaza, the Houthis and other Iran-backed groups in the region have carried out regular attacks they say are aimed at supporting Palestinian militant groups and ending Israel’s military offensive. The Yemeni group has previously claimed drone attacks on the southern Israeli city of Eilat — roughly 1,000 miles from northern Yemen — but the strike on Tel Aviv, if confirmed, appears to represent an increase in the Houthis’ capabilities and reach.The Yemeni group said it would continue to target Tel Aviv with future attacks.“The security system is working to immediately strengthen all defense systems, and will come to account with anyone who harms the State of Israel or sends terror against it,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement Friday.The fatality was a 50-year-old man who was found with severe shrapnel injuries in an apartment adjacent to the blast, said Roee Klein, a paramedic with Magen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service. The nearby Ichilov Medical Center said Friday it had treated and released five people injured in the strike.Israeli media identified the fatality as Yevgeny Ferder, a Belarusian immigrant who arrived in Israel two years ago at the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine. He was killed in the hotel where he both lived in worked, according to the reports.Friday’s rare attack on Tel Aviv took place hours after the Israeli air force said it killed two commanders of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon with which Israel has been exchanging fire. Hezbollah acknowledged the deaths of two of its members but did not identify them as senior operatives.Israel’s aerial defense system, outfitted primarily for rockets, has for months struggled to identify and eliminate Hezbollah drones — which fly lower and often in nonlinear paths — in attacks on Israel’s north.Fabian Hinz, a research fellow who studies drones and missiles at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said that pictures of the debris from the drone that circulated Friday matched the Houthi Samad-3 drone, the group’s “standard long-range strike drone.”The Samad-3 drone, Houthi-produced with Iranian components

ÁLVARO VALIÑO/THE WASHINGTON POSTThe model had previously been used in strikes against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates as well as the southern Israeli city of Eilat several times, in attacks that were intercepted, he said.While Houthi claims that the drone used Friday could evade radar were “certainly false,” it was also possible the group had upgraded the drone to increase its range, including by making the warhead lighter or increasing the size of the fuel tank. It was hard to pinpoint the exact range of the Samad-3, but Hinz said that estimates were between 1,100 to 1,500 miles.The pictures of the debris appeared to show a “slightly higher performance” Iranian-made engine than those normally seen on the Samad-3, he said. It was unclear, he added, “whether it’s a standard Samad-3 version that just got lucky and got through, or whether it’s a slightly upgraded or improved version.”While shorter-range versions of the Samad drones were piloted via a radio link and cameras, the longer-range models relied on satellite navigation. Such systems can be jammed, but antennas resistant to jamming had been observed on Iranian drones, he said.It was difficult to determine exactly where the drone was launched from, given that it appeared to have changed direction at least once, as it headed to Tel Aviv from the Mediterranean Sea, Hinz said.  Other Iranian-backed groups, in Iraq and Lebanon, had tended to use smaller Samad models than the one used Friday. If the Houthis had developed a longer-range drone, such a weapon would provide them with “new angles of attack” that could put additional strains on detection systems and Israel’s capabilities.If Yemen is determined to be the launch site, Israel would find it difficult to launch a counter strike, according to Harrison Mann, a former U.S. Army officer who worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Even the United States has struggled to locate Houthi targets, he said, and has already hit the most the most worthwhile ones.Hamas praised the drone attack in statement, and called on Yemeni militants to launch more of them in defense of the “innocents in Gaza.”Tel Aviv’s mayor, Ron Huldai, posted on X that the city was on “high alert” after the drone attack and that residents were required to follow emergency instructions. “The war is still here, and it is hard and painful,” he said.It was not immediately clear whether the drone was targeting the U.S. Embassy branch office.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday in a post on social media that there were no reported injuries to or deaths of U.S. personnel. He also said he spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and “reaffirmed that our commitment to Israel’s security and right to self-defense remains ironclad.”Fahim reported from Istanbul, Ables from Seoul, Hendrix from Jerusalem.

WaPo_50,Brandon Aiyuk to the Commanders may seem intriguing. Is it realistic?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/brandon-aiyuk-commanders-trade/,2024-07-19 19:00:04.670017,,"San Francisco 49ers star wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk requested a trade this week after negotiations with the team on a new contract stalled. The Washington Commanders, quarterbacked by Aiyuk’s close friend and former college teammate Jayden Daniels, are often speculated as a potential landing spot.But does it really make sense for either party? That’s a loaded question.Money and production. The 2020 first-round pick out of Arizona State led the 49ers in targets the past two seasons and is coming off a career year with 1,342 receiving yards and seven touchdown catches (including an acrobatic grab to spark a comeback in the NFC championship game). His 17.9 yards per reception were second in the NFL, and his seven 100-yard games were the most in a season by a 49er since Jerry Rice in 1995.In short: Aiyuk is exceptional.But he has been the subject of conversations for months because of his tenuous contract talks.According to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, Aiyuk wants “to at least be in line with” star wideouts Davante Adams of the Las Vegas Raiders and Jaylen Waddle of the Miami Dolphins, whose contracts average roughly $28 million per season. Garafolo reported the 49ers last made a contract offer to Aiyuk in May.Aiyuk has pulled the Commanders into the conversation seemingly as a way to pressure the 49ers.After his team lost in the Super Bowl, he hinted at dissatisfaction with a post on Instagram: “Don’t forget what got you there.” In the months since, he has expressed frustration in interviews and social media posts, several of which have included Daniels.Aiyuk told Daniels over a FaceTime made public the 49ers “don’t want me back.” This month, he shared a screenshot of Daniels’s offseason practice film with the Commanders. Aiyuk also brought Daniels with him to his interview on the Pivot podcast.Asked on the podcast what jersey he expects to be wearing this season, Aiyuk said: “If I were to take a guess, probably a Niners uniform. Probably a Niners uniform, but if not a Niners uniform, probably a Washington Commander uniform. If not a Washington Commanders uniform, then probably a Steelers uniform.”The trade request hardly precludes the sides from reaching an agreement soon. The 49ers have a history of closing deals with top players before they begin the final season on their contracts.And the 49ers have the leverage here. Aiyuk is entering the fifth year of his rookie contract, worth about $14.1 million. If he doesn’t report to training camp next week, he could be fined $40,000 per day, and if he misses a preseason game, he could be fined one week’s base salary.The team can forgive those fines, as it did last season when star defensive end Nick Bosa, coming off an all-pro season, ended his holdout to sign a long-term deal. The financials play in San Francisco’s favor.Low. The 49ers are trying to win a Super Bowl, and according to reports, they have made it clear to teams they don’t plan on moving Aiyuk. If they were going to trade Aiyuk, they probably would have done so before the draft, when they could have used the picks to help build the roster.Aiyuk’s situation seems to be following a familiar trend. The 49ers have let negotiations play out with stars for years, including tight end George Kittle (signed Aug. 13, 2020), linebacker Fred Warner (July 21, 2021), wide receiver Deebo Samuel (July 31, 2022) and Bosa (Sept. 6).Seems unlikely. One person with knowledge of the Commanders’ thinking said General Manager Adam Peters won’t discount any opportunity to improve the team and will do his due diligence on every player. Peters knows Aiyuk well from his time in San Francisco. But Peters has also said publicly he won’t mortgage the Commanders’ future for one player and wants to build through the draft. His roster moves this offseason have aligned with that philosophy.Giving up draft assets to acquire a wide receiver and then paying him a sizable contract when the team already has $24.1 million in cap space tied to Terry McLaurin for this season and another $25 million for next season would run counter to the Commanders’ agenda. A scenario that may make more sense is a player-for-player trade. But such deals are rare, and would the Commanders really give up, say, McLaurin, a respected captain? Probably not.The Commanders have three wide receivers who could be considered locks to make the roster (as much as any player can be a lock with a new coaching staff): McLaurin, Jahan Dotson and rookie Luke McCaffrey. The remaining jobs are up for grabs, and Washington could use another elite pass catcher and playmaker for Daniels. Aiyuk already has a connection with Daniels on the field.Cost. Even if the 49ers were open to moving Aiyuk, they wouldn’t give away a player of his caliber on the cheap. For any team to trade for him, it’s with the assumption it will pay the player long term after acquiring him. Picks and cap space are commodities for every team but especially one in a rebuilding phase such as the Commanders.Aiyuk plays for the 49ers — for this season at the very least. Given San Francisco’s history of reaching deals with players before the start of their final season under contract, the same could happen with Aiyuk. If not, the 49ers could use the franchise tag on him in 2025."

WaPo_52,See how Social Security retirement benefits stack up globally,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/19/social-security-global-charts/,2024-07-19 18:59:04.670017,,"The United States is facing crunch time for its Social Security program: In a decade, according to the latest projections, the trust fund for this massive safety net for retirees and the disabled will be depleted, triggering sharp cuts to benefits unless lawmakers take action to bring more money in, spend less or do both.So far, neither President Biden nor former president Donald Trump has made shoring up Social Security central to his presidential campaign. But some American policy experts are looking abroad for lessons.Many countries face the same pressures as the United States: Their aging populations have fewer workers to support retirees. But quite a few countries spend more on their public-pension programs than the United States does, offering more generous benefits and lower retirement ages.Making international comparisons is complicated because of economic, political and demographic differences. But Wellesley College economist Courtney Coile, who has long studied public-pension systems around the world, notes that many countries have enacted policy changes in recent years, while Social Security is largely unchanged since the last major overhaul in 1983.In part, Coile said, that’s because the 1983 reform helped lock in long-run savings, so the United States has spent less over time. “One big point of difference is the benefit level is less generous … than in a bunch of countries,” she said.Here are five charts that show how Social Security compares with retirement systems around the world.In the broadest terms, the financing for Social Security works the same way as it does in pension systems around the world: Workers, employers or both pay a portion of the salary as a tax into a government fund during the years of employment. Then, when those workers retire, they are entitled to benefits via a regular check. So one way to collect more and spend less on public pensions is to raise the age at which people start receiving those benefits.The U.S. statutory retirement age is 66 or 67, depending on your birth year, higher than all but nine countries. Worldwide, the median is 61. In some countries, workers can choose to retire at a slightly younger age — in the United States, as young as 62 — and take lower benefits. Or you can wait a few years in exchange for more generous checks.Several countries have adjusted their retirement ages upward in recent years or have plans to do so. Even so, their workers generally retire younger than Americans. Such reforms are often a political minefield: In France, for example, people furiously protested in the streets over President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.For their part, Trump and Biden have both campaigned on a pledge not to cut Social Security benefits, including by raising the retirement age.When workers retire and start collecting benefits, the change in their standard of living can vary tremendously. Social Security only replaces about 40 percent of the average American’s paycheck, so people who rely primarily on Social Security often see a steep drop-off in monthly income.Percent of pre-retirement income replaced by pension

Source: OECDIn many other countries, benefits are more generous and come closer to fully replacing workers’ paychecks. Americans, by contrast, rely more on private pensions and tax-advantaged savings accounts such as 401(k)s, with contributions made during their working lives matched by employers. But not all workers have much or any savings — and fewer and fewer have union or company pensions — a point that argues against across-the-board benefit cuts to achieve Social Security’s solvency.[See the full data]Social Security is one of the priciest items in the U.S. federal budget, as are pension systems in many other countries. At 7.5 percent of gross domestic product, the United States spends about the same on Social Security as the OECD average, though much less than some industrialized nations such as France, Greece and Italy.Percent of GDP spent on public pensions by country

Source: OECD[See the full data]Social Security would be substantially reinforced if birth rates went up, leading to a higher ratio of workers to retirees. But fertility trends in the United States, as around the world, have been dropping for years. Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argues that increasing immigration, rather than trying to lift birth rates, would best address this labor-force shortage. “We’re not being nice guys by allowing immigration,” she said. “It’s self-interested. It’s better for our economy.”Social Security is funded by taxes paid by workers and their employers over the course of their careers. American workers pay 6.2 percent of their wages while their employers pay an additional 6.2 percent, adding up to a total of 12.4 percent. In 113 countries, the total contribution rate is higher than America’s 12.4 percent; the worldwide average is 16.3 percent.There is great variance both in who pays and how much they pay: Romanian workers, for example, contribute 25 percent of their wages, while their employers usually pay nothing. On the other end, salaried workers in Australia, Lebanon, Russia and Ukraine contribute nothing, while their employers foot the bill.In the United States, some Democrats have cautiously endorsed the idea of raising tax rates, while conservatives argue that such comparisons are misleading. Social Security is based on progressive allocation — low-wage workers get more back in benefits relative to their salary, while high-wage workers get less back. Higher tax rates are uncommon in countries with similar redistribution, said Andrew Biggs, an American Enterprise Institute researcher who worked on Social Security reform in the George W. Bush administration.“When the tax rates tend to get high, the benefits tend to get less progressive,” Biggs said. “You can do this high tax rate if you make it less progressive, because people feel like they’re just paying for themselves, not other people.”While its last calculation is now over a decade old, the OECD has rated how countries compared in redistributing benefits. On a scale ranging from 0 (not at all redistributive) to 100 (the most progressive), the OECD ranked the U.S. system at 42, slightly above the OECD average of 39. That’s more progressive than countries like Finland (4) or Sweden (negative 13, meaning the system is regressive and takes from the poor to give to the rich). In those Scandinavian countries, tax rates are higher, but the relationship between lifetime earnings and retirement benefits is much closer, Biggs pointed out.On the other hand, some countries that redistribute benefits more tend to have lower tax rates: Canada gets a 92 for progressivity — one of the highest in the world — and has a tax rate of 10 percent.Recent debates over Social Security financing often focus on the threshold at which American workers no longer pay that 6.2 percent tax on their wages, which is currently $168,600 in annual income. Earnings above that cap are not subject to Social Security taxes, which means huge chunks of income are exempt for highly compensated workers. (Benefits are also capped, so Social Security also replaces a smaller share of income for high earners.)Many Democrats have argued that raising or eliminating the cap would bring in enough money to help shore up Social Security for decades to come. Biden has included modifications to the cap in his budget proposals in office and in his 2024 campaign plans. The idea that has parallels elsewhere: Costa Rica, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland and Portugal are among the nations that do not cap wages subject to retirement taxes.In countries that do have caps, some exempt more income than others. In Canada, the cap exempts income starting at just 79 percent of the average worker’s salary, meaning even ordinary workers don’t pay taxes on a portion of their income. In countries like Mexico and Colombia, by contrast, the cap doesn’t kick in until a person has earned many times the national average — meaning more highly compensated people pay taxes on more of their income.The American cap of $168,600 works out to about 2.3 times the average worker’s annual wages, putting the United States close to the median globally."
WaPo_53,It was their biggest album. But did ‘Synchronicity’ kill the Police?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/19/police-synchronicity-oral-history-sting/,2024-07-19 18:59:04.670017,,"In December 1982, the Police flew to the Caribbean to record their fifth album. The executives at A&M Records were excited. A year earlier, the trio had leavened their raw, guitar-driven sound with moody keyboards and skronky saxophone fills for their fourth album, “Ghost in the Machine,” generating hit singles like “Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic” and “Spirits in the Material World.” Suddenly, they were filling arenas.But the atmosphere at AIR Studios, on the island of Montserrat, quickly turned sour. Guitarist Andy Summers sniffed at lead singer Sting’s demo of “Every Breath You Take” as cheesy pop, not worthy of a band he still insisted was a guitar trio. Drummer Stewart Copeland bristled when the singer tried to give him orders. And Sting, who had been contemplating going solo, was tired of pretending this was still a democracy: Why were they arguing about whose songs were best? Wasn’t it obvious? Even their typically unflappable producer tried to flee the island at one point.
These were the circumstances under which the Police recorded one of the most popular records of the 20th century. This oral history of “Synchronicity” comes as UMe/Polydor releases an illuminating box set on July 26, featuring a remaster of the 1983 original as well as never-released outtakes, demos and live recordings. Sting was interviewed in person in New York, Copeland and Summers in Los Angeles. Responses have been edited for space and clarity.Copeland, a drummer for prog-rockers Curved Air, and Sting, singer and bassist from jazz-rockers Last Exit, connect in 1976 and decide to try to make it in London’s exploding punk scene. Initially, they tap Henry Padovani, a snarling, black-leathered guitarist from Corsica, as the third in their trio.Copeland: He was the only bona fide punk. Everybody loved Henry. They were suspicious of Sting and put up their shields when I started talking.Padovani: [Copeland] wanted to put a punk band together, and you just don’t do that. It doesn’t work. You’re either a punk band or you’re not. But trying to sort of dress as punks, act as punks, that sort of cred didn’t work, so the Police was really struggling.Sting: I like bossa nova. I like, you know, ninth chords and sixths and flat fifths.Copeland: I learned later that Sting had always had these songs. I don’t know why he never mentioned them. We’re playing my s--- songs. How come he didn’t say, “Dude, I got a better song here”?Sting: Because Henry couldn’t play the songs I’d written. … For some reason, it was me who was given the job to fire Henry. And it was very difficult. But he was very gentlemanly and was very understanding.They meet Summers at a recording session.Copeland: Andy was super cool. Not a gregarious person. We heard Andy playing with that clarity, with this huge vocabulary, with his dynamic charisma on guitar. The music coming out of that instrument lit us up.Nile Rodgers, super-producer and Chic guitarist: Andy had an amazing tone. He’s a great player. [Rodgers croons a line from “Walking on the Moon.”] The sound of that band is that incredible phasing, flange sound. If you take away that guitar sound, you don’t have the Police.Kathy Valentine, the Go-Go’s bassist: I saw them at Madam Wong’s on their very first tour. And there was nobody like them. The Police were really different because they were virtuosos. They had this kind of worldliness and sophistication that I didn’t see in any other band. I don’t think of them as fake punks. I looked at punk rock as being very open.Bill Flanagan, author and former MTV executive: I went to a record store appearance they did [in Boston]. The manager said, “Well, you can each take 10 cassettes,” or something. And they flipped out. They all went for [jazz-fusion band] Return to Forever and Miles Davis. And I remember thinking, wow, that’s interesting. … But then, of course, it made sense. So many of the new wave bands were a little older than you thought they would be. The Clash and the Cars and the Ramones, Talking Heads.After the third Police album, “Zenyatta Mondatta,” becomes the first to crack the Billboard Top 10 in the U.S., the bandmates replace their original producer — Nigel Gray, a physician who had started a recording studio as a hobby — for Padgham, who had recorded hits for XTC and Phil Collins, with his reverb-laden “In the Air Tonight.”Copeland: We never got into a fistfight. ... The reason why we’re screaming at each other is because we both give a s---.Summers: Great art, great music doesn’t come out of a mellow band. You don’t want mellow. Avoid it. It’s all that tension and creative differences that make it. What is music? I always said it’s the sound of a very tight compromise.Sting: If we had had more in common … we would have been together the same way the E Street Band were together. We have completely different backgrounds. Andy’s from Bournemouth, in the south of England. That’s a genteel part of the world. I’m from Newcastle. Stewart was brought up in Beirut with the CIA. His dad was one of the founding members of the OSS. So it’s a false family, really.Miles Copeland, Stewart’s brother and manager of the Police: Stewart knew that Sting’s songs made the Police. That it was really more about Sting than any of the other two. So there was the intellectual Stewart, who understood 100 percent the reality then. Then there was the emotional Stewart. … The Police was his — nobody [else] had anything to do with it, it was all him. It was totally irrational.Summers: I like the second album, “Reggatta de Blanc,” because I thought that’s where we were still raw. There was so much energy in the tracks. I felt that’s where we really became the Police. By the third, there’s all sorts of politics and pressure. By the fourth album, this is getting difficult, you know? And the fifth album, it’s almost impossible for us to come together.
Sting: I think it was in 1981, I played the Secret Policeman’s Other Ball in London for Amnesty [International]. And I sang “Message in a Bottle” on my own and “Roxanne” on my own, with guitar. And I thought, I can do this on my own. And I enjoyed doing it on my own. And so that just gave me the idea. I didn’t act on it for another three years.
Copeland: Sometime during “Zenyatta” was when I got the feeling that he was feeling that way. By the way, I was saying that in my secret diaries in 1978.
Kathy Schenker, former A&M vice president and Sting’s former longtime manager: I think a little bit of him felt an obligation to Stewart, for really plucking him out of obscurity. And the money was appealing. And the other thing was an uncertainty. I mean, he’s always liked risk. He’s always been drawn to challenging himself. But that was really an unknown. And there were very few other major members of a group that were going off on their own and making it.After some unaccustomed time off between albums — Sting starred in a movie, Summers recorded with a side-project combo — the Police reunited in Monserrat for “Synchronicity.” Sting brought a set of new songs inspired by Hungarian journalist Arthur Koestler’s writings on paranormal phenomena.Padgham: We started trying to record and, after about a week, if not 10 days, we did not have one backing track. If somebody had come down to the studio and said, “Play a song,” there wasn’t anything to play.Sting: A band starts off, and no one’s roles are clearly defined. In this case, it was Stewart’s band, and he was the drummer, and Andy was the great guitarist, but the currency of the band was songs. … So that creates a lot of tension, because every song that comes onto the table has to go through the process. So they would write as much as I was writing, but they weren’t … they weren’t good enough, frankly.Padgham: The deal was that Andy and Stewart had to have a song of theirs on the album.Sting: So we get “Mother.”Copeland: He and Hugh Padgham have said, “It was hard telling Andy and Stewart that their songs were crap.” And Sting said, “It’s like telling somebody their girlfriend’s ugly.” Well, just for the record, those ugly girlfriends of mine, rejected by the band in Monserrat, got me a Golden Globe nomination and a Grammy nomination as the score for “Rumble Fish.” … I regret that I didn’t support Andy more. But then again. Sting’s right about one thing. He’s wrong that the other songs were crap. Except for “Mother.”Summers: You know, f--- Sting. That’s all I can tell you. I was listening to Captain Beefheart, and that’s what I wanted to do, something like that. During that period I wrote songs that were better than his. But he would take the upper whip hand because he was a singer and go, “Well, I’m not doing anything.”Padgham: Sometimes I was just so depressed working with them. I remember going out to the studio and ringing up my manager and saying, “I don’t know if I can handle this.”Copeland: “Synchronicity” was the one where it really got to the point where we felt, we’re not going to succeed here. And I could be wrong. I mean, my bruised feelings told me, my analysis was: They hate me. They want me out.Summers: It reached a point where we thought, f---, we needed somebody else to come. And we need a producer, and George Martin, the owner of AIR, was on the island at the time. We’ll just get George Martin. We’re big enough. He’ll come to produce us. The studio is on a hill. And then there’s this valley. And then George was over on the other side. So I get the job. Walking through the f---ing jungle, fighting off everything in the way until I got to George Martin’s house. The maid opens the door, and he’s very much like an admiral. A well-spoken English chap. So I have a cup of tea, telling him we’re having a really hard time of it. Can’t get along. Would you come and produce? “I think it’s going to be all right.” Reassuring me. And this is coming from on high — the producer of the Beatles. “I think when you go back, it’s all going to work out.” So I trudge all the way back into the studio, get back there, and they’re still there. And for some reason, there’d been a sort of a shift. Suddenly, we were very polite to one another and we were very nice. And that’s the way the rest of the record went on.Padgham: My recollection is that Miles was summoned to the island for a meeting, and we actually had a meeting around the swimming pool. And I think it sort of ended up with a vote: Do we carry on making this album, or do we stop?Copeland: Well, we all listened to Miles. And if Miles came down, I guess it brought us down to earth and brought us each out of our silo and to not be grumbling to ourselves about the injustices of the world and of the band, but having to actually … so what’s the next song?Sting recorded multitrack demos of his ideas, in which he provided all the instrumentals and vocals, and presented them to the group. They included a keyboard ballad called “Every Breath You Take,” the driving title track and “O My God,” a song he first recorded almost a decade earlier with his previous band, Last Exit.Sting: I had a little Casio keyboard that only played a single note. That’s what I played on “Spirits in the Material World.” That melody is me on a Casio that cost $25. And then I got a Prophet-6 [synthesizer]. It has all these string sounds. … I got a Synclavier after that. That was state of the art in a sequencer. And I loved that. I mean, that song “Walking in Your Footsteps” was me having fun sequencing. So the songs weren’t created in the band. They were created outside.Jeff Ayeroff, former A&M Records senior vice president: I actually was in the studio when “Every Breath You Take” was recorded, and Sting does his vocal for it. I heard it on a demo, and it was like, “Okay, that’s going to be the first single.”Padgham: Stewart was very anti-“Every Breath You Take” because Stewart wanted to play his style of drumming on it and Sting didn’t. You know Sting wanted it more like the demo, which was, like, very, very simple.Copeland: But that’s not what actually happened. Eventually I totally bought into the notion of: It’s not a drum-set track, it’s a hypnotic rhythm track. There are timpani, there are drum overdubs, there’s a gong drum, there’s cymbal swells. There’s all kinds of cool.Summers: What I remember is the demo. … Up and down the f---ing keyboard, and f---ing the absolute antithesis of what the Police were. We were a guitar trio. That was it. I didn’t think it was great. And Sting and Stewart could not agree on it at all. Where’s the kick drum and the bass going to be? You know, there was just no consensus at all. Finally, we had lunch one day and Sting says, “Go on. Go make it your own.” We came back in the afternoon, and I played the chords. Everybody stood up in the control room. Cheered. That was it.Flanagan: “Every Breath You Take” is like “Hey Jude.” It’s just an undeniable song that’s bigger than anything they could ever do, anything they could ever do afterward.Copeland: [“King of Pain”] is probably my favorite song on the record. I love the lyric. It’s so poignant, and it’s so honest and so Sting. I love that song. That is one of my favorite songs that he ever wrote. I didn’t do anything special with that at all. Just put a backbeat on it.Ayeroff, wanting to upgrade the band’s promotional tools, hires musicians-turned-video producers Kevin Godley and Lol Creme and shows them a black-and-white film of jazzman Lester Young for inspiration.Ayeroff: In England, they were like a pop band. For us, the Police was an important band, not a pop band. I wanted to basically get away from that kind of dismissible video — which I think colored their seriousness and didn’t have any gravitas — and try and do something that has some gravitas. And MTV was the pipeline to every kid in America.Godley: They wanted something that was very classic and went in the complete opposite direction of what you might imagine a typical music video was at that period of time … all glossy and bright colors and fast-cutting and everything. We didn’t want that.Ayeroff: A friend of mine, Leslie Libman, showed me a film called “Jammin’ the Blues” by Gjon Mili. He was a famous photographer, and it was a video from the ’30s or ’40s.Sting: I love the black-and-white. I thought it was very classy. I thought we all look great. We made it at Charlie Chaplin’s soundstage and on the A&M lot. Trudie [Styler, his future wife] visited. It was the first time she had come to America. She met Herb Alpert and went weak at the knees. Still the most handsome man in the universe. We stayed at the Chateau Marmont. That was great. It was great to be with Trudie at that time. She protected me.Released on June 17, 1983, “Synchronicity” knocks Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” off the top of the charts by the end of July and spends 17 weeks at No. 1. The tour opens to more than 40,000 people at Chicago’s Comiskey Park, and opening acts for the 105 shows around the world included R.E.M., Talking Heads, James Brown, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Thompson Twins. It was one of the top-grossing tours of the 1980s — and the end of the Police.Tessa Niles, backup singer: Just the sound of the crowd and the cheering was unlike anything I’d heard. The sound onstage was so loud and so extraordinary. From three guys. Three guys. It was insane. I became aware as time went on that there were tensions and frictions, but onstage it didn’t seem to do anything other than fuel the gigs. They were just incredible every night, and there was never any sense that they were pissed off with each other. And maybe they just worked it out onstage.Alannah Currie, Thompson Twins: The standout one for me was at the L.A. raceway — 50,000 people in the audience, so the biggest we had ever played. The band had a big argument at sound check, and I think there was even a bit of a punch-up between Stewart and Sting. A lot of tension and shouting and swearing. Being the support band, we just lay low and tried to keep out of their way. But then I was standing at the side of the stage when they went on to play that night. It was a perfect warm summer evening, and they were incredible. Really tight. Perfect timing. Sublime drumming, and Sting’s vocals were incredible. The three women who were doing backing vocals had extraordinary voices that just soared. They were dressed head to toe in soft black fabric that blew in the breeze. It was magical. One of the best gigs I witnessed. And I wasn’t even a Police fan.Summers: It was almost like the height of the rock era. No one had ever done this kind of s--- where we played Shea Stadium, the second band since the Beatles to play it. I mean, it was sort of a glorious moment.Sting: I think after Shea Stadium, I said, “I think we should stop now.” And my memory of the meeting was that everybody agreed. Or that maybe they were just so sick of me by that point.Schenker: From the moment Sting said, “I want to start my own band, and I’m going to leave,” I knew it was over and there was no talking him [out of] it, which, believe me, lots of people tried.Sonja Kristina, Curved Air singer and Copeland’s first wife: It felt like this was the end. There was no sort of feeling that they were going to get together again next year or whatever. They were sort of stopping at the top of their game. There’s the creative spark between Stewart and Sting. And it couldn’t spark anymore with the way that it was.Sting: We’re very, very connected emotionally, but we can’t work together. And it’s as much my fault as it’s his. But we do love each other. And I have utmost respect for him as a musician, as a mind and energy. I love him, but I can’t work with him.Copeland: Music has a different function in our lives. We make it for different reasons. And the biggest difference which causes the most problems is that a songwriter quite reasonably feels that the reason for a band is to support the song. Now, I’m a drummer. I bang s---. I don’t listen to the lyrics. The song is in service of the group. … And by the way, this cognition of the problem has arrived 40 years later. He just thought I was being an a--hole. I just thought he was being a d---. And we didn’t understand the fundamental purpose of our lives as musicians were diametrically opposed.Sting: I haven’t completely processed it. I’m grateful for it. I have all of this [gestures around his home] because of that band. And my late career was launched on the success of the Police, the momentum that the Police [gave me, for which] I’m so incredibly grateful.Summers: The thing about the band is it broke up too quickly. We were the best band. I don’t think anybody can compete with us. And we were way bigger than anybody like the Talking Heads. But because it got broken up early, for whatever reasons, way ahead of its time, it hasn’t assumed the proportions maybe it should have in terms of legend or whatever.Sting: The pain that we caused each other didn’t match the joy of making music. You know, it almost wasn’t worth it. But of course, it was. I haven’t figured out what the equation is, but I don’t think there was any other way.Geoff Edgers is writing a book about the Police for Hachette Books, to be published in 2026."
WaPo_54,Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/19/social-anxiety-strategies/,2024-07-19 18:59:04.670017,,"“I enter a party and feel all eyes on me. My pulse quickens, my face burns and my stomach churns. Everybody must be judging me — the way I look, walk, talk and eat. Over time, I start avoiding more and more social situations because I can’t bear the anxiety. This isolation is soul-crushing.”This is the kind of story I frequently hear from my socially anxious patients. As a psychologist, I have noticed that social anxiety has become one of the most often cited reasons people seek therapy in my practice, especially since the rise of social media and all the virtual ways we interact with each other as well as the pandemic. Anxiety is gradually increasing, and social anxiety disorder — previously termed social phobia — is the second-most prevalent anxiety disorder (after specific phobias), affecting about 1 in 10 adults and teens.Social anxiety disorder involves substantial anxiety in social or performance situations and is accompanied by a strong fear of being rejected as well as appearing or acting in a way that leads to embarrassment and humiliation. When social anxiety significantly interferes with an individual’s work, establishing or maintaining relationships, leisure or other functioning (for example, using public transportation, traveling, playing sports), we diagnose it as a disorder. Social anxiety disorder usually starts in childhood or adolescence and persists throughout a lifetime.Caring about others’ views of us and feeling discomfort in some social situations are perfectly normal — a result of our evolutionary past, when rejection by one’s tribe was life-threatening for early humans. And some people are just more shy by nature while others are the life of the party. Whereas shyness represents a milder form of social anxiety, it should not be mistaken for a mental disorder.If you suffer from social anxiety, you can learn to lessen or overcome it by understanding it and using certain helpful strategies.My work with socially anxious patients often leads us to an undercurrent of harsh self-judgment and seeing themselves as socially awkward, inadequate and inferior to others. They often take any judgment as a sign of rejection, and in turn, take rejection personally — a reflection of something wrong with them. To make matters worse, they tend to see others reacting disapprovingly even when that is not the case. For example, socially anxious people perceive even subtle negativity in others’ faces as threatening, and they mistakenly interpret positive social interactions in a negative way.Social anxiety also has been linked to setting unrealistic social goals and having perfectionistic standards for interactions — each social encounter serving as additional “proof” of one’s inadequacy. Furthermore, socially anxious individuals overestimate any negative consequences of social encounters, often ruminating and obsessing over what they shouldn’t or should have said or done for hours or even days. When you feel so bad about yourself, you are more likely to construct your life around preventing further rejection, thus perpetuating social anxiety.Self-criticism is most successfully countered with self-compassion. This website provides a good compilation of evidence-based strategies for increasing it.A more unorthodox approach that I sometimes suggest to my patients is to ask others what they think of you. A socially anxious person might be surprised to discover that they come across better than they imagine.Finally, a deeper exploration — with a competent therapist, for example — might be required to uncover causes of any pervasive and immutable feelings of worthlessness or unlovability.Studies show that socially anxious people fear that their anxiety is visible and thus try to suppress it. More generally, they tend to avoid, distract from and minimize their negative feelings. And they are reluctant to pursue meaningful goals, for fear of inviting difficult emotions. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: They end up shutting themselves off from positive emotions such as joy, excitement, awe and contentment.To increase positive emotions and a sense of meaning in life, people with social anxiety could practice mindful meditation and learn to avoid labeling feelings as negative or positive, opening themselves up to all internal experiences.Other helpful strategies include reducing alcohol or similar substances used to numb emotions; tracking and sharing what they are grateful for; and clarifying what matters the most to them and committing to pursuing it, however gradually.Several vicious cycles maintain or worsen social anxiety. Socially anxious people often avoid or escape social situations, making their anxiety graver in the long run. Life can become very small and limited, often leading to profound loneliness, depression or substance abuse — which in turn exacerbate anxiety.Many socially anxious individuals stay glued to their phones at a gathering, refrain from speaking at a business meeting, wear inconspicuous clothing, only talk to their partner at a party, wait for an empty train car or use extra makeup to cover up any redness. These “safety behaviors” prevent them from learning that social situations or outward signs of anxiety are not as scary as they imagine them.Furthermore, socially anxious people sometimes make things worse for themselves by engaging in behaviors that turn off or alienate others. For example, they hyperfocus on how they are appearing to others rather than showing interest in others. And they are quick to anger, or fail to be kind after a poor social interaction. I have observed that social anxiety is so frustrating and exhausting that many of my patients have little energy left to be forgiving and empathetic.Gradually approaching anxiety-provoking social situations, while reducing safety behaviors, is the main way to reduce social anxiety. When done methodically with a therapist, this approach is called exposure therapy, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). After learning how to tolerate anxious feelings and thoughts, a patient usually progresses from vividly imagining participating in social situations to doing it in real life.I also find it useful to work with my socially anxious patients on improving awareness, recognition and naming of various emotions that show up in addition to anxiety. This emotional literacy helps them notice when frustration or anger arises, allowing them to act in a less-detrimental way toward others. Finally, I often recommend my socially anxious patients to go to a party, look around to see who seems uncomfortable, and talk to them to help them feel better. This strategy not only shifts the focus away from self, but also engages curiosity, generosity and compassion — all antidotes to social anxiety.Jelena Kecmanovic, PhD, is a clinical psychologist and professor in the D.C. area.

WaPo_55,"California is a battleground for AI bills, as Trump plans to curb regulation",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/biden-trump-ai-regulations-tech-industry/,2024-07-19 18:59:04.670017,,"SAN FRANCISCO — Republican delegates meeting this week in Milwaukee pledged to roll back federal restrictions on artificial intelligence, while other allies of former president Donald Trump laid plans for “Manhattan Projects” to boost military AI.But in California, the state’s Democratic-controlled legislature is moving in the opposite direction, debating a proposal that would force the biggest and best-funded companies to test their AI for “catastrophic” risks before releasing it to the public.The measure, written by Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco, has drawn howls from tech industry leaders, who argue it would scare off technologists aiming to build AI tools in the state and add bureaucratic busywork that might box out scrappy start-ups.Opponents of the bill have claimed it could even result in developers being sent to jail if their tech is used to harm people, something Wiener has vociferously denied.After the bill was approved by a California Senate committee earlier this month, Google’s head of AI and emerging tech policy Alice Friend wrote a letter to the chairman arguing that its provisions are “not technically feasible” and “would punish developers even if they have acted responsibly.”Wiener says the law is necessary to forestall the most extreme potential risks of AI and instill trust in the technology. Its passage is urgent, he said, in light of Republican commitments to undo President Biden’s 2023 executive order, which uses the Defense Production Act to require AI companies to share information about safety testing with the government.“This action by Trump makes it all the more important for California to act to promote robust AI innovation,” Wiener said on X last week.The bill has established Sacramento as ground zero for the battle over government regulation of AI. It is also shedding light on the limits of Silicon Valley’s enthusiasm for government oversight, even as key leaders such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly urge policymakers to act.By mandating previously voluntary commitments, Wiener’s bill has gone further than tech leaders are willing to accept, said Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.It is “suggesting that Big Tech needs to be much more accountable,” Lee said, “and that was not well received among industry.”Dylan Hoffman, TechNet’s executive director for California and the Southwest, said Friend’s letter — along with letters from Meta and Microsoft before it — show the “weight and importance” the companies place on the measure. “It’s a pretty extraordinary step for them ... to step out from behind the trade association and put their name on the letter.”Spokespeople for Google, OpenAI and Meta declined to comment. “Microsoft has not taken a position on the bill and will continue to maintain support for federal legislation as the primary means to regulate the issues it addresses,” said Robyn Hines, senior director of government affairs at Microsoft.Even before Wiener unveiled his bill in February, California had established itself as the nation’s de facto tech legislature. After years of debate in Congress, California passed the country’s most wide-ranging digital privacy law in 2018. And California’s Department of Motor Vehicles has become a key regulator of autonomous vehicles.On AI, Biden’s executive order last October marked Washington’s most extensive effort to regulate the booming technology. But Republicans have announced plans to repeal the order if Trump wins Nov. 5, leaving states to carry the flag for stricter AI regulation.More than 450 bills involving AI have been active in legislative sessions in state capitals across the nation this year, according to TechNet, an industry trade association whose members include OpenAI and Google. More than 45 are pending in California, though many have been abandoned or held up in committee.But Wiener’s bill is the most prominent and controversial of the batch.  It would require any AI company deploying a certain amount of computing power to test whether its models could lead to “catastrophic” risks, such as helping people develop chemical or biological weapons, hacking into key infrastructure or blacking out power grids. The companies would submit safety reports to a new government office, the Frontier Model Division, or FMD, which would have the power to update which AI models are covered by the law, something opponents say could introduce even more uncertainty.The bill tasks the government with creating a cloud computing system to be used by researchers and start-ups, allowing them to develop AI without having to rely on the massive expense of Big Tech cloud companies.Dan Hendrycks, founder of the nonprofit Center for AI Safety, consulted on the bill. Last year he organized an open letter signed by prominent AI researchers and executives claiming that AI could be as dangerous to humanity as nuclear war and pandemics.Others argue such risks are overblown and unlikely to materialize for years, if ever. And skeptics of the bill point out that even if such risks were imminent, there is no standard way to test for them.“Size is the wrong metric,” said Oren Etzioni, an AI researcher and founder of the AI deepfake detection nonprofit TrueMedia.org. “We could have models that this doesn’t touch but are much more potentially dangerous.”The focus on “catastrophic” risks has also frustrated some AI researchers who say there are more tangible harms from AI, such as injecting racist and sexist bias into tech tools and providing another venue for people’s private data to be vacuumed up by tech companies, issues that other bills moving through the California legislature aim to tackle.The bill’s focus on catastrophic risks even led Meta’s head of AI, Yann LeCun, to call Hendrycks an “apocalyptic cult guru.”“The idea that taking societal-scale risks from AI seriously makes one an ‘apocalyptic cult guru’ is absurd,” Hendrycks said.Hendrycks recently launched a company called Gray Swan, which builds software to assess the safety and security of AI models. On Thursday, tech news site Pirate Wires published a containing allegations that the company represents a conflict of interest for Hendrycks, because it might win business helping companies comply with the AI law if it is passed.“Critics have accused me of an elaborate scheme to make money, when I fact I’ve spent my professional career working to advance AI safety issues,"" Hendrycks said. “I disclosed what is a theoretical conflict of interest as soon as I was able, and whatever I stand to gain from this tiny startup is a minuscule fraction of the economic stakes driving the behavior of those who oppose the bill.”Although Hendrycks has lately been criticized by some Silicon Valley denizens, leaders of the companies opposing the law have issued similar warnings about the danger of powerful AI models. Senior AI executives from Google, Microsoft and OpenAI signed the letter that Hendrycks’s group circulated in May last year warning that humanity faced a “risk of extinction from AI.” At a congressional hearing in the same month, Altman said that AI could “cause significant harm to the world.”OpenAI also joined last year with fellow start-up Anthropic, Google and other tech companies to start an industry group to develop safety standards for new and powerful AI models. Last week, tech trade association ITI, whose members include Google and Meta, released a set of best practices for “high-risk AI systems” that include pro-active testing.Still, those same companies are pushing back on the idea of writing commitments into law.In a June 20 letter organized by start-up incubator Y Combinator, founders railed against placing extra scrutiny on projects that use a large amount of computing power. “Such specific metrics may not adequately capture the capabilities or risks associated with future models,” the letter said. “It is crucial to avoid over-regulating AI.”Start-up leaders also are concerned that the bill would make it harder for companies to develop and release “open source” technology, which is available for anyone to use and change. In a March post on X, now-Republican vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance described open source as key to building models free of the political bias of OpenAI and Google’s tech.Wiener has altered the bill in response to industry feedback and criticism, including by stipulating that open-source developers aren’t responsible for safety problems that emerge from third parties changing their tech. Industry critics say those tweaks aren’t enough.Meanwhile, other bills working their way through the California legislature have drawn less notice from the tech industry.Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, a Democrat who represents a suburban swath of the eastern Bay Area, wrote several AI bills moving through the chamber, including one requiring companies to test AI models for biases. Another of her bills would ban developers from using the personal information of children to train their AI models without parental consent, potentially challenging the tech industry practice of scraping training data from websites.AI bills introduced by other California legislators would require tech companies to release summaries describing the data used to develop AI models, create tools to detect AI-generated content, and apply digital watermarks to make AI-generated content identifiable — as some companies including Google have already attempted.“We would love for the federal government to take a lead here,” Bauer-Kahan said. “But in the absence of them functioning and passing laws like this, Sacramento feels the need to step up.”"

WaPo_58,"Republicans wrap up an energized, focused convention",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/republicans-wrap-up-an-energized-focused-convention/,2024-07-19 18:04:04.670017,,"Good morning, Early Birds. Yay, it’s Friday. Have a great weekend. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … Congressional Democrats keep pressure on Biden to drop out ... Trump fans’ surprising calls for cooler rhetoric … but first …MILWAUKEE — The Republican convention wrapped last night with a 90-minute, often-rambling acceptance speech from former president Donald Trump, who spoke in detail for the first time about the assassination attempt last weekend that left him injured.“I stand before you in this arena,” Trump said, after walking out onstage with his name displayed in large, bright lights, “only by the grace of Almighty God.”After Trump acknowledged he was “not supposed to be here” had he not moved his head slightly, avoiding a gunman’s bullet, supporters in the arena chanted, “Yes you are!”Here are some of our observations after spending the week in Milwaukee:This was an extremely good week for Trump and the Republican Party. Trump’s assassination attempt turned him into a Godlike figure for his most ardent supporters, who gathered here in Milwaukee. Delegates and elected officials told us it was the most unified they have seen the party since at least 2004, and some said since the Reagan era.Some of the speakers dug into hot-button topics, such as transgender rights and plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. And there was almost no mention of Republicans’ most controversial claims — for instance, that the 2020 election was stolen and that the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, are political prisoners — until Trump mentioned off-script that “people” in the Biden administration are not “fierce” except when they are “cheating on elections.”Abortion was barely mentioned; the Republican Party has approved a new party platform that loosens its previous policy of stringent abortion restrictions.The good week for Republicans has caused even more anxiety among Democrats. The sanitizing of Trump’s party has made Democrats we spoke to even more nervous about their ability to beat Trump in November. (We’ll have more on the Democrats below.)Convention organizers appeared to have paid close attention to polling. They kept it tightly focused on all of the issues where Biden is weakest, including the economy, the border and crime, by using regular Americans to tell personal stories.And Wednesday night’s lineup of speakers leaned heavily into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, one of the lowest points of Biden’s presidency. Family members of several of the 13 soldiers who were killed at Kabul airport during the chaotic withdrawal were featured in video and spoke onstage.After Trump’s apparent assassination attempt, he declared that the convention would be about unity. In his opening remarks, Trump said he was “running to be president for all of America, not half of America.”“I am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether you are young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican, or independent, Black or White, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and friendship,” Trump said.But that was the only time Trump offered a fig leaf to Democrats. He only mentioned Biden once in his speech when blaming him directly for the “unthinkable” damage he has caused to the country.Unity in Milwaukee, instead, meant uniting and growing the GOP. Trump has remade the party as one of loyalty and fealty as nearly all of Trump’s critics in the party have been silenced at this point.The convention showed more diversity than usual for a Republican convention. The first night a Muslim woman closed with a prayer in Arabic. A Black pastor from Detroit praised the former president. Several Hispanic and Black lawmakers and Republican voters were given time to speak about their love for Trump.Trump’s former Republican foes, including his 2024 competitors, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pledged their support. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) gave a very different speech than he did eight years ago when he refused to endorse Trump.And the convention featured many former Never Trumpers or Democrats turned Trump voters, from former model Amber Rose to Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.).No one personified that change more than Trump’s vice-presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who was once one of Trump’s sharpest critics. But during his acceptance speech Wednesday, Vance praised Trump for being “right on all of these issues while Joe Biden was wrong.”Republicans spent all week wondering whether Trump would discuss surviving the assassination attempt and whether such an experience would soften the politician many respect for his “strong man” image.Many gathered in Fiserv were struck by the image of Trump looking visibly emotional, and grateful, on Monday before he made his first appearance since the shooting to a riled-up crowd.But on Thursday, Trump’s softer side wasn’t on display. Instead, he leaned into strong masculinity with Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock. He spoke about how he’d overturn a “tragedy of failures” by the Biden-Harris administration and launched into a rant about how murderers in South American countries are flooding through the U.S.-Mexico border.Yet throughout the week, many women in Trump’s life played a critical role in humanizing him. Trump’s granddaughter Kai Trump, 17, spoke about how loving her grandfather is. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders recalled how Trump encouraged her when she was down. Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, spoke about how supportive her father-in-law is.As the camera panned to him, on cue he tilted his head to the side, smiled and mouthed “thank you.”It was an attempt to show a personal side of Trump; in the last election, Trump’s lack of support among women played a major role in his loss.This could be a key weekend for Democrats as pressure on President Biden to step out of the race ahead of the Democratic National Convention next month continues to ramp up.This is what Biden is facing:“President Biden has not spoken to Congressional leadership today,” campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo said. “The President is his party’s nominee, having won 14 million votes during the Democratic primary. He’s running for reelection, and that will not change until he wins reelection.”But all congressional leaders have remained in touch with Biden’s inner circle as the weeks and conversations with the president unfolded.Plus, rank-and-file Democrats and donors are becoming more anxious and desperate.Most Democratic lawmakers who remain concerned are holding off on going public with their displeasure until after the weekend, in case Biden makes an ultimate decision then. But this week, three more congressional Democrats came out against Biden: Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — a key Pelosi ally — Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) and Sen. Jon Tester, who is running a tough reelection race in Montana.If Biden doesn’t drop out by Monday, the number of lawmakers that go public could skyrocket.Opponents of Trump reacted incredulously when supporters of the former president came out against heated political rhetoric following the attempted assassination of Trump.Trump supporters have sought to place the blame for the attempted assassination on Biden, who said at a recent donor event that “it’s time to put Trump in a bull’s eye.”Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) claimed that “Joe Biden sent the orders,” and Vance said that Biden’s portrayal of Trump as a would-be dictator “led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”More than 300 corporate executives and lobbyists were at the RNC this week as guests of the Trump campaign, with one person in attendance describing the atmosphere of the private concourse in which they watched the convention and rubbed elbows as “like a cocktail party” every night.Trump reportedly did not appear in the suites on the concourse, but campaign advisers say his running mate, Vance, had a suite. Cryptocurrency executives and others from the tech industry were present in noticeable numbers, alongside numerous Republican leaders.“The thing that made my eye pop a little bit is the high concentration of Trump officials and elected officials in such a small space. It’s just been really remarkable,” one donor said.Must reads:From The Post:From across the web:You could always shave the beard.Hopefully this puts an end to the speculation that I am secretly J.D.

WaPo_59,Did Donald Trump blow his RNC acceptance speech?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/19/trump-rnc-acceptance-speech-convention/,2024-07-19 18:00:04.670017,,"You’re reading the Prompt 2024 newsletter. Sign up to get it in your inbox. Donald Trump on Thursday accepted his party’s nomination for the third time — his first as an ex-president. Let’s block from our minds the image of J.D. Vance bobbing his head along to Kid Rock, if we can, and instead focus on Trump’s speech.I’m here with two Davids whose work I very much admire — Ignatius and Von Drehle — who can help us figure out what Trump achieved, or didn’t achieve, in his speech delivered less than a week after he was nearly killed by an assassin’s bullet.Matt Bai: Between the three of us, we’ve seen dozens of conventions — some of which seemed shorter than Trump’s acceptance speech. I generally don’t like handing out grades, but let’s start there anyway, because I’m curious to see if we agree. How do you grade the speech and why? David Ignatius, you go first.David Ignatius: I’d give him a B-plus in the first half. A C-minus for the second half which was partisan, predictable and seemed to lose even the captive convention audience.David Von Drehle: It’s hard to know how to grade it. The first 15 minutes might have been a solid A, which is a great grade for Trump. But then it turned into something painful to endure — surely the longest acceptance speech on record. He oughta hope that most Americans will only see highlights or shut it off.Bai: Well, I’m going to go a different way and give him a disappointing D, and I’ll tell you why. He had a chance tonight, I thought, coming out of the tragedy in Pennsylvania, to address his biggest weakness: his divisiveness. He had a chance to broaden his appeal considerably without losing any of his base. But he made a few noises about unity, blamed Democrats, took responsibility for nothing  and then devolved into a dark and ranting rally. Just as Hillary Clinton had a chance to put Trump away in 2016 and failed, I think he squandered that same chance tonight, no matter who his opponent ultimately is.Von Drehle: It got to the point where I thought he might say: “Folks, I will stop talking if you vote for me.”Bai: What do we think of his use of the assassination story? Moving or tacky? Hard to see Reagan doing that.Von Drehle: He had a chance to put it away and blew it. But to put it away, he would have had to be an entirely different person.Bai: I agree with that. Bigness is not his most obvious virtue. I thought perhaps the shooting would prompt at least a political calculation.Von Drehle: Reagan might have used it, but in three or four sentences. Trump’s rule of rhetoric is “anything worth saying is worth saying over and over and over again.” He ruins all his good lines.Ignatius: In the early parts of the speech, I thought he talked convincingly like a man who had narrowly escaped death. He spoke more quietly than usual, without the usual smirk or scowl. But as the speech went on, the talk of unity seemed to me to vanish into the teleprompter.Bai: Mr. Ignatius, given your mastery of foreign policy, I wonder how disturbed you were by his citing Viktor Orban, at length, as a validator. Strange for an American presidential candidate, no?Ignatius: The Orban reference was bizarre. The Hungarian leader’s chief virtue seems to have been that he came to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Trump made a gratuitous attack on President Biden, accusing him of causing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as if Vladimir Putin and Hamas were not among the great villains of our age. He talked about how he would end a “planet of war” but never said a word of useful specifics.Bai: I think it’s also hard to discuss this speech without at least mentioning the exaggerations and untruths littered throughout, although we’ve grown almost inured to them. This is the worst inflation the country has ever seen? Not even close. Anything strike you as especially egregious?Von Drehle: It was news that he was somehow going to keep the Bagram air base after negotiating the U.S. surrender to the Taliban. Yeah? How was that going to work? I grant the Biden administration made a mess of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, but the decision to pull out without a plan was entirely Trump’s.Ignatius: As the speech wore on, and Trump rambled through his pet peeves, I began thinking: This man is very beatable. Maybe not by someone named Biden (or Harris). But tonight, Superman didn’t seem to have his cape.Bai: I agree. He is not an electoral behemoth — far from it. Shame on the party that can’t capitalize. Also, I found the religious imagery — both in the convention generally and in the first part of the speech — to be somewhat unsettling. The assassination attempt seems to have given rise to an almost overt worship of Trump as a Christ-like figure, with the ear gauze as a kind of crucifix. There were almost constant references to his being an instrument of God.Von Drehle: The “saved by God’s grace” did not bother me. Although a better speech would grapple with the question of where this grace was for the three people seriously wounded, one fatally.Ignatius: Anyone who survives an assassination attempt gets to invoke God.Von Drehle: Exactly right, David.Bai: Yeah, I suppose that’s fair — he was incredibly lucky, as was the country. But to me, there was a level of worship at this convention, with that story at its core, that felt more religious than political, and unusual for any party convention.Von Drehle: The missed opportunity was to say what he feels saved to do. Did God spare him to talk aimlessly about how strong Hulk Hogan is? To brag about how he redesigned the prow on a Navy ship? To tell us that his dad liked evangelist Billy Graham?Ignatius: He seemed to be saying at the beginning that he was “saved” to unify the county. But as the speech continued, the rhetoric became poisonous.Bai: Yes, that ties it all together nicely for me — well said. It’s fine to feel divinely favored and grateful. But to what end? He had an opportunity to do something more profound with that, and win an election at the same time. But as you say, that’s not who he is.Ignatius: The interesting thing to me about the speech was that Trump was at once the reformed man, who has seen the light of unity, and in the next moment the backslider who couldn’t escape his addiction to trivial partisanship.Bai: Yes, I think the reform part was overhyped and not really in the speech. And Democrats should breathe a sigh of relief at that. Because no idea in American politics is more attractive right now, or has been for many years now, than reform. Trump has always had the capacity to own that, as an outsider, but he’s just more of a culture warrior at heart.Von Drehle: For folks who fear a Trump tyranny, tonight was a great reminder that the man lacks the self-discipline to get big stuff done."
WaPo_60,How to filter microplastics from tap water,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/19/portable-filters-microplastics-tap-water/,2024-07-19 20:00:02.845840,,"Q: How do I find out the quality of my tap water in Fairfax, Va., and what is the best way to filter out microplastics? I rent, so I can’t do under-the-sink or over-the-faucet filters, which I understand are the best. Our faucet tap is a hanging one with a spraying feature.A: You’re smart to start by asking what’s in your water before you shop for a filter because different filters take out different things. Once you know what’s in your water, you can select a filter that takes out what you don’t want to drink. NSF, an independent testing and standards-setting organization that started as the National Sanitary Foundation, has a web page with links to specific filters based on some of the most common chemicals of concern, such as lead.Finding out what’s in your water is relatively simple. The Environmental Protection Agency requires all community water suppliers to provide a detailed analysis, known as a Consumer Confidence Report, to customers every July. Fairfax, like many other water suppliers, has posted its 2024 report online. Read the report to find out the levels of lead, nitrates, salts and even uranium in the water where you live. Fairfax Water currently tests for 285 compounds; the 2024 report says most of these were undetectable.But the tests don’t cover microplastics, which refers to particles smaller than 5 millimeters long, about the size of a pencil eraser. Obviously, you wouldn’t expect to see bits of plastic that size coming out of a tap, but microplastics can also be much smaller. EPA researchers set the lower limit at 1 nanometer (for comparison, an average human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide). Particles smaller than 1 nanometer are usually called nanoplastics.Some microplastics are manufactured in a small size for use in consumer products, but a lot of what is now in the environment worldwide comes from breakdown of the plastics that seem to be used for everything these days, including construction materials, food wrappers and clothing made of polyester or acrylic. Rather than decomposing as they age, plastics break up into smaller and smaller particles. Dryer lint, shredded plastic tarps, and bits of discarded food wrappers get into the air and soil and eventually wash into streams and rivers and wind up in oceans — and in drinking water. Microplastics have even been found in well water.Yet microplastics aren’t tracked in the annual reports water agencies send to their customers. The word does not even appear in the 2024 Fairfax report. Susan Miller, public affairs officer for Fairfax Water, said that’s because there is no EPA-approved testing protocol or standard for microplastics. The EPA is working on that and began giving grants in 2018 to fund research into ways to identify microplastics in drinking water, with the aim of developing testing methods that are quicker and easier than the complicated laboratory analysis needed now. Other researchers are focusing on possible health effects from ingesting microplastics.Once there is a good way to test and a better understanding of what level of microplastics should be allowed, water agencies will probably include that information in their reports, just as they are beginning to do for another emerging area of concern: “forever chemicals” known as PFAS, for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances.In the meantime, the best way to select a filter that will minimize your exposure to microplastics is to go by the size of the particles it removes. There is no mandatory standard, but two independent organizations — NSF and the American National Standards Institute, known as ANSI — have established voluntary standards for drinking water and a certification process. Standard 42 limits aesthetic issues — ones that affect the taste, smell or clarity of water — while Standard 53 details chemicals that have health consequences. Standard 42 puts particles into six size ranges. Class I particles are 0.5 to 1 micron, Class II are 1 to 5 microns, on up to Class VI, which are bigger than 50 microns.Researchers still don’t understand how microplastics affect human health. So for now, filter manufacturers can treat plastic particles like any other particles, covered under Standards 42 as an aesthetic issue. Any good filter should come with a data sheet that details what it filters out. To avoid drinking microplastics as much as possible, get a filter that removes Class I particles.Under-the-sink and over-the-faucet filters are great because they filter all the water that comes out of the tap. But renter-friendly options for filtering drinking and cooking water also exist.Brita, which sells a range of filter types — including water bottles, countertop dispensers and faucet add-ons — lists microplastics on the data sheet for only one of its filters: the Brita Hub, a countertop model. It is certified to remove 99.9 percent of microplastics and other Class I particles. (With a nine-cup reservoir, the Brita Hub lists for $119.99. With a 12-cup reservoir, it’s $179.99. The filter needs to be changed twice a year, at a current cost of $29.99.) A countertop model would present no issues to a renter.The Brita Pitcher with an Elite filter and Brita’s Faucet System also are certified to remove Class I particles, but the data sheets don’t mention microplastics. Perhaps that’s because these products were introduced before the presence of microplastics in tap water became such an issue, while the Hub model went on sale only last year. (Efforts to talk to someone in Brita’s technical department weren’t immediately successful.)Some Brita filters would not be a good choice for removing microplastics. The company doesn’t claim any particulate reduction for its standard filter or its reusable filter. And the Brita Bottle, a water bottle with a built-in filter, and the Brita Stream, a pitcher filter that lets you pour water without delay after you fill the container, are certified to remove only Class VI particles.Have a problem in your home?

WaPo_61,"And for her next feat, she’ll topple 100,000 dominoes in D.C.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/07/19/lily-hevesh-domino-toppling/,2024-07-19 19:59:02.845840,,"She’s spent 10 days painstakingly constructing her art installation — and now she’s about to destroy it with the flick of a finger.On Saturday, D.C.’s National Building Museum will see 100,000 dominoes topple in a colorful feat of engineering. The installation — made with sleek, straight-edged neon tiles built for knocking down rather than the traditional dotted kind — features elaborate field constructions and rarer domino “tricks,” such as giant collapsing walls and fragile domino towers, all connected by a fluid chain of evenly spaced slabs.The chain reaction of metronomic tck-tck-tcks is expected to last eight full minutes and promises to be supremely satisfying.The mastermind behind it is Lily Hevesh, a 25-year-old domino artist and artist-in-residence at the museum, who has garnered fame in the international domino community and beyond for her massive, inventive creations.She and her team of nine international builders have crafted the 50-by-50-foot trail with the ultimate goal of having it crash down in carefully calibrated chaos for the exhibit’s grand finale. “When you see the effects that the dominoes are creating by having that motion and kinetic energy, that’s where I think the real beauty of domino art comes out,” Hevesh told The Post.Hevesh is building all this inside the museum’s Great Hall, where anyone can stop by and see the team in action as they construct the domino field. While they’re separated from the public by a short, white picket fence to protect the domino art from any unintentional toppling, members of the public can get up close and personal to the different sections and their builders.There is a sense of precarity inherent to the scene: “More people, more manpower, more dominoes,” per Hevesh, also mean more risk. Pieces that are even a millimeter off can wreck an otherwise mesmerizing topple. Yet the workers add pieces at a rate much faster than one would expect for a job requiring such precision.
Each tile is perfectly spaced and angled so that it collapses onto the next — and the next, and the … — as intended.
Aileen Fuchs, president and executive director of the National Building Museum, said it’s been stressful for her to watch the build in progress. She and the museum’s security guards constantly wonder if the dominoes are too close to the barriers shielding them, or if someone might knock them accidentally. But she also finds peace in watching Hevesh and her domino builders at work.“I find it contemplative. There’s something incredibly peaceful and mesmerizing about the specificity of where you have to place each one,” she said.Fuchs first found Hevesh through a friend, who recommended she check out the YouTube sensation’s Hevesh5 videos.“My kids were mesmerized. I was mesmerized,” Fuchs said. From that point last summer, it had been a goal to get the artist to the museum, where Fuchs hoped she would build something spectacular.The residency is Hevesh’s biggest self-led project to date, and the culmination of years of practice and innovation.Hevesh first found her calling in dominoes as a child. When she was 9, her grandparents gifted her a 28-piece set of traditional dominoes. The New Hampshire native loved watching them collapse and soon found a robust (and growing) community of domino content creators on YouTube. These people, many of them in Europe, would collaborate with one another to build bigger and bigger projects. Their channels would grow in popularity as more people tuned in to their satisfying topples — a harbinger of the ASMR fads that would follow in the late 2010s, when viewers turned to sensorially satisfying videos to trigger a “tingling” feeling.Hevesh decided she wanted to be a part of that online community. She found herself a good set of toppling dominoes — which are still relatively rare in the United States — and began to teach herself the basics. Almost immediately, she got to work posting videos of her own creations at age 10, in 2009.Though her account, Hevesh5, was anonymous for the first six years of its existence — leading many to believe that Hevesh was a middle-aged man, as many in the domino community tended to be — she has since made a name for herself as a young, record-breaking domino artist.Fifteen years and 505 videos later, her channel has amassed 4.1 million followers and 1.8 billion views. Hevesh’s work has also been featured on “Saturday Night Live,” “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Today” and “The Late Late Show With James Corden.” In 2016, she had her first brush with the silver screen when Will Smith toppled her domino installation for the film “Collateral Beauty.” Hevesh has also traveled the world for her dominoes, taking part in collaborative projects and international events like the World Domino Collective in the Netherlands.She attended college at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute near Albany, N.Y., where she studied design, innovation and society, but dropped out after a year to pursue dominoes full time. She was receiving paid commissions for her work at that point, and it was through practicing the art that she picked up the physics, geometry and design skills she needed to be successful in her craft.This week, Hevesh broke the world record for the tallest domino structure with a tower more than 33 feet tall, inspired by the Building Museum’s 75-foot classical columns. Guinness World Records witnesses and surveyors were on hand for the topple to prove it was a free-standing structure.In a public art project like “Destination Domino,” where museum visitors are encouraged to watch Hevesh and her team operate in real time, the stress of getting it just right is multiplied. “It’s a little more pressure, because now we’re like, ‘Oh, we need it to work. Because there’s people watching and it’s a live event,’” she said.Like many in the domino world, though, Hevesh has found comfort in surrendering to the risk and knowledge that mistakes “happen all the time,” knowing that things can be built again, and better.“It definitely goes from super meditative — like, I’m in my own zone — and really relaxed, to the other end of the scale where I’m like, ‘I’m so nervous right now, I really hope I don’t drop a domino,’” she said.Hevesh doesn’t have a unified theory for why so many millions of people are drawn to her work, though she cites the novelty and ASMR-like experience as potential reasons. Fuchs, as a fan herself, thinks it may have something to do with the sense of amazement that comes with watching such carefully planned chain reactions unfold, as if by magic.Perhaps, too, the appeal resides in watching something fall apart, but in a planned, desired and even beautiful way. The toppling tiles provide the illusion of control over gravity. They hint at the possibility of impending collapse being a little less scary.After all, it is only when the last domino falls in a display of “beautiful destruction” that Hevesh finds her pieces have truly reached completion.“When you topple a domino project,” said Hevesh, “that’s the pure or true domino art.”“Domino Topple” will take place Saturday at 4:30 p.m. at the National Building Museum, 401 F St. NW, Washington, D.C., 202-272-2448. nbm.org."

WaPo_63,Dining solo on vacation? You should always sit at the bar.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/restaurant-bar-seat/,2024-07-19 19:59:02.845840,,"Welcome to The Upgrade, By The Way’s series on travel hacks and hot takes. See how to submit here.Being led to the bar instead of a table can make some restaurant patrons feel a certain stigma. But I often advise friends that it’s the place to be. If you have the confidence to claim a stool, the rewards will be many. It beats a dark corner table every time.Service is often faster and more efficient at the bar. You may get a view of an open kitchen a la “Chef’s Table” without paying a premium. And, most importantly while traveling away from home, you’re improving your chances of getting into one of the most popular restaurants in town. (Bar seats are often left for walk-ins only.)My bar stool bias was confirmed on a recent impromptu trip to Australia. At Pellegrino 2000 in Sydney — immensely popular after Taylor Swift visited during her Eras Tour — I easily snagged a seat on a busy Saturday afternoon. Rather than waiting for unlikely last-minute cancellations (as my hotel concierge suggested), I perched on a stool to enjoy what many hyped as the trendiest restaurant in the city.Peering into the kitchen, I didn’t have to rely on Google Images to guide my order. Umming and arrhing over whether to get the spaghetti vongole or prawn-stuffed ravioli, I saw two young chefs making dumplings from scratch — sold. I ordered the ravioli as a primi and followed the recommendation of my bartender, Thomas, for the wild barramundi. While I waited on my food, Thomas told me where else I should eat and drink during the remainder of my stay.On the same trip I snagged a bar seat at Woodcut, a swanky new restaurant by the harbor. I had a prime seat watching a brigade of chefs play with a naked flame, manipulating a wood-burning oven, a Japanese robata grill and a traditional Basque-style grill that cooked my John Dory. The sommelier was my unofficial dining partner for the evening, popping in between courses to tell me about affordable local sips.One caveat when you’re dining at the bar: You don’t have to go it alone, but don’t push beyond a party of three. Any more, and you will find yourself choosing conversations to your right or left. If you’re sharing plates, you may run the risk of missing out on dishes. No one wants to go home hungry, especially if we’re going Dutch.Europeans have long seen the bar as a social destination, where locals drop in for a quick coffee in the morning and have an aperitif at night. On my last visit to Paris, I found more restaurants with the “comptoir” (counter bar) design and culture. I didn’t feel unrefined sitting by the bar at Maxim’s as I tucked into my terrine de campagne in the newly reprised historical house of Paris. Nor did I feel bougie at Laurent, where I dipped a crusty baguette into my eggs en cocotte with caviar for less than $22. At Le Chiberta and Brasserie Fouquet’s, offshoot eateries of star chefs in Paris, the counter remains my favorite seat in the house.Perhaps there is something about dangling your feet off the ground that makes bar dining more playful, social and engaging. Give me a high bar stool over a low table pressed up against a wall or restroom any day. There’s nothing inferior about sitting by the bar — if anything, it’s the hottest seat right now."
WaPo_64,What Families USA’s new boss brings to the table,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/what-families-usas-new-boss-brings-table/,2024-07-19 19:38:02.845840,,"Good morning, and TGIF. Mississippi ranks last in women’s health and reproductive care outcomes across the United States, according to a new Commonwealth Fund scorecard, which places Massachusetts at the top. Find out how your state ranks here. Got tips? Send them to mckenzie.beard@washpost.com.Today’s edition: Two top senators want to haul the leader of embattled Steward Health Care to Capitol Hill. Federal regulators approved a best selling e-cigarette — but only in tobacco flavor. But first …Q&A: Where Anthony Wright wants to lead Families USAAnthony Wright, the new executive director of Families USA, is hitting the ground running.Last week, Wright started his new role in Washington after 22 years as executive director of Health Access California. I caught up with him to discuss his vision for one of the nation’s leading health-care advocacy organizations. Our conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.Health brief: Are there lessons you learned at Health Access California that you think will be helpful in Washington?Wright: One lesson is to make sure that there’s a strong consumer voice in the crafting of health-care policy. Patients and the public are sometimes left out of these discussions, but they are the point of the health-care system and should be at the center of the conversation.Health brief: What health policy issues do you intend to prioritize early in your tenure?Wright: Right now, we have a government guarantee that nobody has to spend more than 8.5 percent of their income on health coverage, but that’s set to expire in the next year.If those tax credits are allowed to expire, that would mean a spike in premiums of hundreds of dollars per month on average and potentially around 5 million Americans losing coverage. That’s a crucial policy that we need to get lawmakers on the record about as we go into this fall.Health brief: How are you preparing for 2025 and the election aftermath?Wright: We need to be very clear that our health care is on the ballot. There are stark differences on health care that we need to hear from our policymakers on, whether it’s reproductive health, the ACA and its future, the [expanded tax credits] or prescription drug prices.On prescription drug prices, we could see [the federal government] either expanding both the number of drugs that we negotiate over and having those discounted prices be extended to a much broader set of payers and patients. Or we could see that power be repealed.In terms of the ACA, it’s not just the 5 million people who could lose coverage under the expiration of those subsidies. It’s the 20 million-plus folks that might lose coverage under a total repeal … [which would bring on] spiking premiums leading the market into a death spiral.Health brief: Is there anything you achieved in California that you’d like to see replicated on a national scale?Wright: In California, we worked a lot on the issues of cost and value, and Families USA has also been a leader in that. We created an Office of Health Care Affordability that set a goal for health growth, which a number of states are following.Given my background growing up in the Bronx in the poorest congressional district in the country, being a son of an immigrant from Ecuador and the grandson of immigrants from Ireland and China, and actually even being uninsured for parts of my childhood, issues of access, economic security and equity are a personal passion for me. That’s something I was happy to work on in California and want to continue doing so with this national cap.Sanders, Cassidy seek subpoena vote for Steward Health CEOThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is launching an investigation into the bankruptcy of Steward Health Care, a Dallas-based company with private equity ties that owns 31 hospitals across eight states.Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and ranking member Bill Cassidy (R-La.) announced that the panel will vote on July 25 to subpoena Steward’s CEO, Ralph de la Torre, to testify at a Sept. 12 hearing on the health system’s financial decisions leading up to its May bankruptcy filing.Key context: Steward is selling all of its U.S. hospitals to help offload its $9 billion debt, which includes $1.2 billion in loans, $6.6 billion in unpaid rent, nearly $1 billion in unpaid bills from medical vendors and suppliers, and $290 million in unpaid employee wages and benefits.Steward has blamed rising interest rates, labor costs and insufficient government health insurance reimbursement rates for its bankruptcy. Newly released court documents also show that in the months leading up to the filing, top executives awarded themselves multimillion dollar payouts.Zooming out: Steward’s bankruptcy is being probed in several states, including Massachusetts and Arizona. The health system is also under scrutiny by the Justice Department, which recently launched a criminal investigation into the company over allegations of fraud and corruption, according to Michael Kaplan of CBS News.Steward didn’t respond to a request for comment.The CEO of Steward Health Care is the poster child for the type of outrageous corporate greed that permeates through our health care system. It's time for this CEO to get off his $40 million yacht and explain how much he's gained financially while bankrupting Steward Health Care. pic.twitter.com/8tgqiyLaTPFDA allows sales of more tobacco-flavored vapesThe Food and Drug Administration is allowing R.J. Reynolds to keep several e-cigarette products on the market, my colleague Rachel Roubein reports.Federal health officials authorized sales of seven of the company’s Vuse Alto vaping products, but only for tobacco-flavored pods.The agency stressed the move “does not mean these tobacco products are safe.” In a statement, the FDA said the company showed the products have the potential to provide a benefit to adults who smoke cigarettes, adding that kids are less likely to use tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes compared to other flavors.The background: Last year, the FDA denied R.J. Reynolds’s application for several menthol-flavored products, a decision the company has challenged in court. But last month, the agency authorized the first menthol-flavored e-cigarette products, manufactured by NJOY, which drew swift criticism from some public health advocates.Meanwhile …A government watchdog found compliance issues with federal Medicaid eligibility redetermination requirements in nearly all states, including with long-standing requirements.Key context: A pandemic-era policy prevented Americans from being dropped from Medicaid until it expired in April 2023. This prompted states to review their ballooning rolls and remove those no longer eligible for the safety net program.The Government Accountability Office identified several compliance issues during the so-called “unwinding.” For instance, about 420,000 eligible individuals, including children, lost coverage because states assessed household, not individual, eligibility, according to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.On the move: Joel McElvain is now acting deputy general counsel at HHS, overseeing matters related to CMS. McElvain, a longtime Justice Department official, had previously been serving as HHS special counsel, working on drug-price negotiation.At RNC convention, Republicans differ on how much to focus on abortion (By Meryl Kornfield and Hannah Knowles | The Washington Post)What to know about cheaper, imitation weight-loss drugs (By Daniel Gilbert and Teddy Amenabar | The Washington Post)Covid summer wave spreads across U.S., even infecting Biden (By Fenit Nirappil and Lizette Ortega | The Washington Post)Your results sound a bit different when your brain is still fighting off the propofol pic.twitter.com/tJuBv24DjrThanks for reading!

WaPo_65,The imaginary Trump ‘unity’ pivot was just another demand for fealty,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/trump-imaginary-unity-pivot/,2024-07-19 19:17:02.845840,,"Former president Donald Trump gave two speeches on Thursday evening as he accepted the Republican Party’s presidential nomination in Milwaukee.The first was a quiet one, almost demure. Reading from a teleprompter, Trump described last Saturday’s attempt on his life and celebrated the retired firefighter who was killed. The teleprompter kept Trump pointed in the desired direction but had the odd effect of draining some of the energy. When he is reading his speech, Trump’s delivery tends to be flat — useful for rattling off campaign promises but not helpful when building to an emotional point.The second speech, which began immediately after the recitation of Saturday’s events, was vintage Trump. It was riffing about the audience and joking about his allies and bragging about his record. It ran way too long and drained the crowd’s energy. It was a standard Trump campaign presentation with standard timing and standard campaign rhetoric.News reports suggested that Trump’s acceptance speech would be something different. It would mark a new tone, one centered on a spirit of unity in the wake of the attack. “Getting shot in the face changes a man,” one Trump ally insightfully offered — ignoring that Trump’s injury was to his ear and that the aforementioned ally was former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Trump, reflecting upon his brush with death, would seek to end America’s deep political divisions.The day after the shooting, he made this point on social media.“In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United,” Trump wrote, “and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”And then, two days later, he offered another thought that provided insight into his views on unity.“The Radical Left Democrats are desperately trying to ‘Play the Ref’ by calling for an illegal and unConstitutional attack on our SACRED United States Supreme Court,” he wrote. “The reason that these Communists are so despondent is that their unLawful Witch Hunts are failing everywhere.”Even before that not-very-uniting post, it was clear that Trump’s “unity” message did not mean he was embracing an opportunity to reconsider his divisive politics. It was, instead, a potential opportunity to absorb the sympathy being expressed by Democrats in the moment and use it to demand that they be nicer to him. Nor was he alone in this. Asked a tough question on Monday, Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. complained about the insolence of the reporter’s query “even today, even 48 hours later,” as though the question had not been about immigration but about restricting the weapon used by the shooter.Trump isn’t new at this. He has been seeking public office for nearly a decade now. As such, he has a record. He has called for unity more than once in the past. And each time he has done so, he has quickly made clear that his vision of unity was that his opponents would stop criticizing him and start letting him do what he wants.During the acceptance speech on Thursday, Trump offered up the promised call for unity — such as it was.“We must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is what’s been happening in our country lately at a level that nobody has ever seen before,” Trump said. “In that spirit, the Democrat Party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy.”He turned away from the prompter to add another point.“Especially since that is not true,” Trump added. “In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country.” (He would, at another point in the speech, claim that the 2020 election was won through “cheating.”)After then mentioning the (dubious) dismissal this week of the classified-documents case against him, Trump demanded that his opponents leave him alone. You know, because of unity.“If Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts,” he said, “which I have been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people.”Unity, then, means nothing more than the abandonment of the criminal indictments obtained against Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, something not in the control of “Democrats.” There was no reaching across the aisle, just Trump trying to pull people over to his side.Nor was there even an effort to demonstrate reciprocity on the point. He criticized Democrats — and “Crazy Nancy Pelosi” — for issuing subpoenas “because they’re destroying our country.” He railed against America’s “failed and even incompetent leadership,” obviously in reference to President Biden.News reports seized on a claim that Trump would be so removed from partisan bickering that he wouldn’t even mention Biden’s name. Then Trump mentioned Biden’s name.“I say it often: If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States — think of it the 10 worst added them up — they will not have done the damage that Biden has done,” Trump said. Seemingly then remembering his pledge, Trump then promised he wouldn’t say the name again.There was never any reason to take the assertions about Trump’s changed tone seriously. “This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,” Trump told one sympathetic reporter, which wasn’t false. It’s just that Trump was obviously not interested in or capable of doing so. If Trump wanted to be a unifying figure in American politics, he has had lots of opportunities over the past nine years to give it a try.An acceptance speech is not a normal political speech. It is a unique moment for a candidate to speak to Americans, to voters, and explain why his or her candidacy is worth their support. To deploy inspiring language and craft memorable framing. Trump gave the same speech he always gives, with that slow, teleprompter-driven prologue about the assassination attempt tacked on.The attempt on his life became another bargaining chip in another deal, one weakened by the lack of evidence that the shooter was motivated by partisan animus. Trump played the chip anyway, demanding that his critics and prosecutors step back in recognition that something significant was different. But in leveraging the shooting as he did, he made clear that nothing was different at all."
WaPo_66,"Nguyen Phu Trong, who led Vietnam’s outreach and crackdowns, dies at 80",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/19/nguyen-phu-trong-vietnam-dies/,2024-07-19 19:14:02.845840,,"Nguyen Phu Trong, a longtime ideologue in Vietnam’s Communist Party who rose to power in 2011 and later cemented control in the one-party state with purges against corruption, and political crackdowns that jailed journalists and activists, died July 19 at a hospital in Hanoi. He was 80.The death was confirmed in an official statement carried by state media. On July 18, Mr. Trong stepped back from his powerful position as general secretary of the Communist Party, citing poor health. Vietnam’s president, To Lam, took over in a caretaker role.On the world stage, Mr. Trong was seen as an artful practitioner of Vietnam’s “bamboo diplomacy” — called so for bending in different directions — as the country navigated ties with its most important economic partners, China and the United States, while also building bonds with nations such as India and Russia.His hold within Vietnam was less finessed. His anti-corruption drive attempted to burnish public trust in the Communist Party and its stewardship of Vietnam’s economy, one of the most dynamic in the region, with sectors that include a growing start-up culture.At the same time, Mr. Trong tightened the state’s grip on other freedoms. He oversaw hard-line Communist Party directives aimed at the media, civil society groups and internal political challenges.In May, police arrested Nguyen Van Binh, an official in the Labor Ministry who had advocated for independent trade unions. He was charged with disclosing state secrets during talks with U.N. envoys, but many rights activists interpreted the prosecution as punishment for his reformist views.Since the Vietnam War era, the country’s political leadership (then North Vietnam) developed as a collective system among the Communist Party general secretary, the president, prime minister and the top-ranking member of the National Assembly. Mr. Trong asserted his influence in ways rarely seen.He was elected as the party’s general secretary in 2011 and reelected five years later. After the death of President Tran Dai Quang in 2018, Mr. Trong took on the presidency as well — making him head of the party and state. Only a few others, including North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, held both titles at once.In 2021, Mr. Trong left the presidency but was reelected by the party as general secretary for a third term, the first leader in more than three decades to serve more than two terms. After the vote by party members, the 76-year-old Mr. Trong said he was “not in great health” and preferred to rest but would honor the decision to have him remain party head.When Mr. Trong hosted President Biden in Hanoi last September, the White House carefully calibrated its talks. Both nations value their economic links — the United States is Vietnam’s top export market — and U.S. policymakers regard Vietnam as an important regional buffer against Chinese power in Southeast Asia.Amid the outreach, however, Biden called attention to Mr. Trong’s strongman style. “I also raised the importance of respect for human rights as a priority for both my administration and the American people,” Biden told journalists. “And we’ll continue … our candid dialogue on that regard.”Human rights advocates and others have been more outspoken. Project 88, a watchdog group that monitors Vietnam, portrayed Mr. Trong as presiding over a “police state [that] has imprisoned scores of human rights activists and dissenters, while shutting down the only independent journalists’ association” in a country of nearly 100 million people.Project 88 estimated nearly 200 people had been jailed for political reasons under Mr. Trong’s rule, including environmental activists, journalists and trade unionists. Mr. Trong’s one-party state also successfully pressured tech companies such as Meta to scrub criticism of party leaders from its platforms.Still, for many in Vietnam, Mr. Trong’s gains in foreign policy and the anti-corruption campaigns are viewed with favor as the centerpieces of his legacy, said Khang Vu, a scholar of Vietnamese affairs at Boston College.“You cannot deny that there were political motivations behind some of the corruption cases as a way to keep the party in line and Trong in control,” he said in an interview. “Yet it’s also clear that many officials and businesspeople act with far more caution now, knowing that there can be consequences.”The corruption-hunting began after Mr. Trong started his second term as party leader in 2016. Within four years, more than 100 Communist Party members, including some top Politburo figures, had been disciplined or criminally charged on counts of graft, illegal business deals and other misdeeds.In a speech, Mr. Trong compared the purges to a “burning furnace,” which was adopted as the name of the anti-corruption drive. Probes touched military officers, banking magnates and highly placed political figures.The information minister, Truong Minh Tuan, was fired in 2018 and sentenced to 14 years in prison for behind-the-scenes dealmaking in the purchase of a television station. His predecessor, Nguyen Bac Son, received a life sentence in 2019 for receiving an estimated $3 million in kickbacks.One case reached as high as the president’s office.Top deputies of President Nguyen Xuan Phuc were placed under criminal investigation for alleged power abuse during the pandemic, including claims they took bribes for seats aboard chartered flights to repatriate Vietnamese citizens stranded abroad during lockdowns.Phuc was ordered by the Communist Party to resign in January 2023 and was replaced by Mr. Trong’s ally, Vo Van Thuong. Thuong resigned a year later following a terse Communist Party statement saying he “had shortcomings which affected public opinion and the reputation of the party, state and himself.”In another inquest backed by Mr. Trong, the chief executive of a health-care company, Viet A, acknowledged bribing officials for contracts to sell substandard coronavirus test kits to hospitals. The scandal led to the arrests in June 2022 of the health minister and a former government minister of science and technology.Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, described the corruption-fighting as a way for Mr. Trong to consolidate power and quash other centers of influences.“This is bare knuckled politics, as elites seek to consolidate their wealth and power,” Abuza wrote in a commentary for Radio Free Asia. “The days of collective leadership are gone.”Nguyen Phu Trong was born in a rural district outside Hanoi on April 14, 1944. His official state biography described his early years as those of a “poor peasant.”In 1967, he received a degree in linguistics from Vietnam National University in Hanoi and then applied for membership in the Communist Party. He was accepted into the party in 1968 as the Vietnam War was escalating.He served in various roles involving enforcement and interpretation of Communist Party doctrine over the next three decades, including editor of a top party mouthpiece, the Communist Review, from 1991 to 1996. Earlier, he had been sent to study in Moscow, receiving a doctorate in history from the Academy of Sciences in 1983.He was groomed for leadership after becoming part of the Politburo in 1997 and served as chairman of the National Assembly from 2006 to 2011.Soon after being named party general secretary, he made a visit to China that included talks with President Hu Jintao. Mr. Trong attempted to avoid friction with Beijing while also noting his efforts to strengthen ties with the United States. Mr. Trong urged dialogue over the South China Sea, which Beijing claims as its territory but is seen by Washington as part of China’s efforts to expand its military reach in the region.Then, in the span of four months in 2015, Mr. Trong made officials visits to China and the United States, where he met with President Barack Obama in talks that included greater economic cooperation.Mr. Trong struck a tone of realpolitik in an address to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, saying he recognized the interpretations of political freedoms and expression differed between the two countries. “But we should not let human rights issues hinder the relationship between the two countries,” he said.In a further diplomatic straddle between East and West, Mr. Trong hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in June  in a show of Vietnam’s efforts to strike a neutral position on the war in Ukraine.Mr. Trong was married to Ngo Thi Man, and they had two children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.Nguyen Thanh Giang, a Vietnamese analyst at the Singapore-based ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute think tank, said Mr. Trong’s zeal to fight corruption also forced a hard look at Vietnam under one-party rule.The campaign “was meant to repair the system,” Giang said, “but in fact has exposed the cancer of corruption and political decay of the regime.”Rebecca Tan contributed to this report."

WaPo_68,Why our meteorologists love the new ‘Twisters’ movie,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/19/twisters-movie-weather-review/,2024-07-19 19:00:02.845840,,"This article contains spoilers for the movie “Twisters.”It’s one of the most anticipated weather events of this year — a fictional movie about tornadoes.When the trailer was released for “Twisters,” the follow-up to the 1996 blockbuster “Twister,” meteorologists and storm chasers beamed — even as some expressed some concerns about whether it would be accurate. While it’s not a perfect representation of reality, “Twisters” is likely going to make weather nerds and most moviegoers pretty happy.The film focuses on a talented meteorologist named Kate Carter (played by Daisy Edgar-Jones) and “tornado wrangler” Tyler Owens (played by Glen Powell), who drive dangerously close to tornadoes and devise a scheme to tame their fury. The Post’s review says the film “blows away the summer competition” and rates it 3.5 stars out of four. In our view, aside from the validity of the characters’ lofty goal, the action-packed movie presents a better understanding of tornado chasing, impacts and science than its predecessor.“There’s attention to detail that I don’t think was there the first time around,” said Rick Smith, a warning coordination meteorologist at National Weather Service forecast office in Norman, Okla., who was consulted on the film. “I went in knowing how hard that [the crew] had worked, how much fact checking they did and how much they strived — the director, the producers and even the actors — to wherever they could make it scientifically accurate.”Several members of The Washington Post’s weather team — meteorologists Matthew Cappucci, Jeff Halverson and Jason Samenow and reporter Kasha Patel — attended a recent screening of the Steven Spielberg project directed by Lee Isaac Chung, which opens in theaters across the country on Friday. Cappucci, a tornado chaser himself, has spent hundreds of hours pursuing storms. Halverson, a professor of meteorology, has written textbooks on severe weather. Here are our takeaways:"
WaPo_69,FAFSA mess leaves mixed-status families in limbo as school year looms,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/19/fafsa-mess-leaves-mixed-status-families-limbo-school-year-looms/,2024-07-19 19:00:02.845840,,"Before the end of his junior year at Washington State University Tri-Cities, Jesse Gonzalez already had a job offer. His internship with an environmental cleanup company in Richland, Wash., had gone so well that his bosses invited Gonzalez to join full-time after completing his studies.That seemed easy. All he needed was enough financial aid to cover one more year of tuition. Since $19,000 in federal and state grants knocked out the cost of his junior year, Gonzalez was confident the same would happen for the 2024-25 academic year.But an exhausting battle with the federal financial aid application has jeopardized his plans.Gonzalez, who was born in the United States, has spent the last six months trying to help his mother, an undocumented Mexican immigrant, complete her portion of the online form. Like many families of mixed immigration status, they keep encountering problems with the new Free Application for Federal Student Aid through no fault of their own.Every solution provided by the Education Department has brought Gonzalez, 23, a step closer to getting financial aid, but never quite there. Now, a month from the start of the fall semester at WSU Tri-Cities, he is still waiting.“It’s just so frustrating,” said Gonzalez, who is double majoring in business administration and psychology. “I feel stressed because I need to provide for my mom, I have to provide for myself and this one thing is in my way.”Processing errors and delays with the revamped FAFSA have affected millions of students who filled out the form this year. But the plight of students from mixed-status households has been especially tough. Many had to wait months to apply because a technical issue with the form prevented parents without Social Security numbers from participating. A string of workarounds and fixes helped some but others still had trouble verifying their identity.Despite the Education Department’s troubleshooting, unresolved issues could make the next financial aid application — slated to launch Oct. 1 — just as trying for mixed-status families as the current one.“There’s uncertainty,” said Karen McCarthy, vice president of public policy and federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “There haven’t been any updates [from the Education Department] on either their progress in getting the system to fully work for these families or what will happen for 2025-26.”Completing the FAFSA is a critical step in college enrollment. The form is the gateway to billions of dollars in grants from the federal government, states, foundations and colleges. It is needed for access to federal loans and work-study jobs and can determine whether low-income students enter or remain in college.About 340,000 students from mixed-status households submit the form each year, according to the Education Department. Those numbers could grow as the immigration advocacy group FWD.us estimates that approximately 491,000 students aged 17-21 have at least one undocumented parent.For Gonzalez, FAFSA was a straightforward process the first time he filled out the form as a transfer student to WSU Tri-Cities in 2022. Before then, he had paid out of pocket to attend a local community college, but pursuing a double major at a university would require more money and neither of his parents could afford to help.With his first FAFSA, Gonzalez’s mother, like other parents without Social Security numbers, had to print, sign and mail a signature page for his application to be processed. That was standard protocol until this year. Now, undocumented parents must create a Federal Student Aid ID and answer a few questions to verify their identity. But the new process took months to work.After completing his portion of the FAFSA in late January, Gonzalez tried to create an FSA ID for his mom but kept getting stuck. He would enter her name, date of birth, mailing address and then try to click on a box indicating that she was unable to provide a Social Security number. A glitch in the system would not let him check the box.“I couldn’t get past that last step,” he said. “We kept trying to make an account for two months and nothing would work.”By mid-March, Gonzalez thought the situation would turn around after the Education Department made a technical update that let undocumented parents contribute to the financial aid form. Yet the fix didn’t work for him.Gonzalez called the FAFSA helpline multiple times. Sometimes he would get an automated message asking callers to try again later because of “high call volumes.” Other times the line would get disconnected.In April, he was finally able to create an FSA ID for his mother. Then new problems emerged.Gonzalez clicked a button on his financial aid application to invite his mother to add her information. But the invitation never showed up, no matter how many times he sent it, he said.“My mom was getting an email every week saying ‘Please help Jesse complete his application or he won’t be eligible for financial aid.’ It was so stressful because she was doing everything she could to help,” Gonzalez said.By then, he was days away from his college’s June 1 deadline to complete the FAFSA. Doubt started to set in.“I just kept thinking: ‘I’m at the end of the line but will I make it to the end?’” Gonzalez said. “Obviously, I could take out loans … but why should I have to when I know I qualify for grants?”Gonzalez turned to his college financial aid office for help as he began questioning whether to re-enroll in college. Jana Kay Lunstad, director of financial aid at WSU Tri-Cities, assured Gonzalez that the university would find funding for him if the situation wasn’t resolved by the beginning of the semester.“There’s so much at stake for this young man,” Lunstad said. “This is a student who is on track to graduate, who has lined up a high-paying job. We’re going to work with him, and all the students who are in similar positions.”On the first Friday in June, past the school’s deadline for completing the FAFSA, Lunstad, Gonzalez and his mom spent an hour on the phone with Education Department staff still trying to resolve whatever error was preventing the completion of the FAFSA. Lunstad said the rep encouraged Gonzalez to submit the paper form, which he and his mom filled out in her office that day.The trouble is, the Education Department has yet to process the approximately 47,000 paper applications that it has received to date. On July 11, the department said it identified issues that have delayed the process, which was already weeks behind.And that’s not the only loose end the department needs to tie up.If unfixed, the problems with identity verification for mixed-status families could be a barrier for students who need financial aid in 2025.After undocumented parents had trouble verifying their identity, the federal agency in April said their U.S.-born children could temporarily finish the FAFSA before that process was completed. Then the Education Department warned that it will restrict the accounts of any parent who fails to verify their identity before the beginning of the 2025-26 application cycle, effectively blocking those students from applying for aid for the fall of 2025.Identity verification is cumbersome. Parents without a Social Security number must answer up to four questions supplied by the credit agency TransUnion, such as their previous street address or employer. If the information doesn’t match the company’s records, parents must then complete a signed form and submit a utility bill, foreign passport or consular identification card to the Education Department.Some parents never got the TransUnion questions and instead received error messages directing them to start the manual option. Any missteps, or even a typo in a document, could derail the process.A spokesperson for the Education Department said it’s working on the problem. “Allowing those without an SSN to enter the form without completing the identity validation process will remain in place while we work on the longer-term solution.”Silvia E. Marquez, executive director of financial aid and scholarships at the University of California at San Diego said her office is scheduling one-on-one sessions with students and parents and calling the department to try to finish the application.“Each one is taking an hour, if not more, and we’re in July, Marquez said. “My fear is people are going to give up.”"
WaPo_70,All this parenting advice is getting in the way of parenting,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/19/too-much-parenting-advice/,2024-07-19 20:18:03.067462,,"For 15 years, Christine Carrig has worked with hundreds of preschool and kindergarten children at the Montessori school she founded in Brooklyn. She has celebrated milestones with their families, and she has supported them as they navigate big transitions and big feelings. Over that time, the typical developmental hurdles her students face haven’t really changed.But the way parents respond to them has, she says, especially over the last couple of years.She’s noticed it most in parent-teacher conferences. Often, nothing is actually wrong: A young child struggles at drop-off; they are still learning how to share; they sometimes have tantrums. But increasingly, she finds that parents are more likely to respond to even benign reports about their child with concern, reflexively grasping for a solution: What should I do when this happens? What words should I say? Is there a book or a resource you’d recommend?“They began approaching us the way you’d approach a parenting expert,” Carrig says. “They’re looking outside themselves for the answer. And that is heightened in a way that it is new. And it isn’t settling down.”She knows why this is happening, because the parents tell her: They are drowning in parenting advice. It comes from everywhere, but especially through social media — a cacophony of voices offering microbursts of guidance through endless feeds of scripted videos.“It starts to shrink down their world to where parents truly believe there is one right thing to say for every situation, there is one right way to approach every scenario,” Carrig says.Overwhelmed parents aren’t new, and neither is parenting advice — nearly 80 years after Dr. Spock published “The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care,” it remains one of the best-selling books of the 20th century. It’s been 20 years since “mommy blogs” took over the internet in the early aughts. There has never been a shortage of parental worry, nor of people who build careers assuaging it. But now the digital realm follows us everywhere in our palm — and if you’re a parent (especially a mother) on social media, the myriad instructions and expectations online can coalesce into an inescapable, ambient drone.Carrig, who is also a mother of four kids under the age of 12, worries about what this means for parents, and others echo her concern for the generation raising children in an age of perpetually accessible advice. Therapists and psychologists are concerned that the barrage of external voices can silence a parent’s intuition, erode their ability to tolerate uncertainty, and amplify the mythology of “perfect parenting.” Parents say they are depleted, struggling to balance the demands of their own circumstances with the idealized scripts they are trying to retain and recite.And there are a lot of them. A quick scroll might turn up a video explaining how to make your kid feel empowered and cooperative while you’re applying sunscreen (Becky Kennedy, a.k.a. Dr. Becky, who has nearly 3 million followers on Instagram); telling you how to gentle-parent your child when they have poured your coffee everywhere (Laura Love, nearly 8 million followers on TikTok); or showing you how to talk to a toddler who is pushing back on potty time (Big Little Feelings, 3.5 million followers on Instagram). There are videos for every conceivable situation in between, shared by hundreds of parenting-focused accounts representing a slew of different philosophies.The problem isn’t necessarily the quality of the advice itself (though that can certainly be a concern), but the sheer volume of it, and the relentlessness of its algorithmic accumulation: Click on one parenting reel, and you’ve guaranteed that more will find their way into your feed. What does the resulting onslaught mean for parents on the receiving end?“It ultimately has really made me feel like I fail as a parent almost every day,” says Skye Klosterman, a mom of two in Maryland with a baby due in September. Her social media feed is filled with accounts like Mr. Chazz, Big Little Feelings, Peace and Parenting — and they can be excellent, she says, but sometimes difficult to put into practice. “I try really hard. But it is so paralyzing in the moment when your child is not behaving or you’re having a hard moment. Instead of naturally responding to my kid, I have to stop and be like, ‘Well, was there a scenario that I just saw on Facebook that could help me guide my kid?’ And then it almost makes me more reactive than responsive, because I get really overwhelmed, and I don’t know which way to turn.”Natasha Goykhberg, a parent of two in New York City, noticed a growing sense of dissonance between her own instincts and the guidance she had seen in gentle-parenting videos. When her then-2-year-old son sprawled on a sidewalk because he didn’t want to leave a playground, she thought of the parenting expert who had advised sitting silently beside the child in moments like this, to pat his back and not make eye contact, to never forcibly move him. “And internally, I knew at the time, ‘This doesn’t feel right. I’m the parent in this situation, I’m the one that needs to create a boundary for this child, whether he likes it or not,’” Goykhberg says. “But I was so unsure of myself that I didn’t quite know how to just do that, so I relied on this script.”For Alyssa Rosen, a mother of four in Maryland, the inundation led her to finally quit TikTok after her husband gently suggested she step away. “It was just too much,” she says. “I used to watch all the parenting videos obsessively, like if I watched enough I would have all the answers to parenting.”But the advice she was finding “wasn’t tailored to my own kids, my own life, or me.” The more she started hearing other people’s voices in her head, she says, the more lost she felt.At the end of March 2020, Becky Kennedy — a clinical psychologist and founder of the “Good Inside” parenting empire, widely known as “the millennial parenting whisperer” — shared her first Instagram post, offering parents tips to anchor their families during a time of extraordinary stress and uncertainty. The post went viral, and her following soared from the hundreds to the hundreds of thousands.A few months later, Instagram introduced reels to its platform, allowing users to create video clips up to 90 seconds long. That same year, TikTok became the most downloaded app in the world. Kennedy was soon accompanied by the masses, a proliferation of parenting experts and influencers populating the newest corners of the digital ecosystem, reaching an audience of pandemic-era parents desperate for help.From Carrig’s vantage point, the impulse imprinted on parents in that time of isolation and emergency — to seek external instructions, to look online — has not subsided. And she worries that the scripted guidance they’re finding often eclipses the needs, intuition and circumstances of the parent in the equation, even as they’re promised a solution.“You’re selling parents the idea that their path to parental ease is found through centering the child and the child alone. But fundamentally, there are so many other things going on in the lives of parents these days, and they are so lacking in support, that to say ‘your way out of this is just to learn this approach’ — it’s misleading. It’s just putting one more thing on their plate,” she says. “You’re asking parents to pull from a nearly empty well when you’re asking them to just continually co-regulate with the child and to use all of these scripts.”Melanie Rainbow, a psychotherapist and mother of two in Iowa City, says she has worked with millennial moms who have become so focused on those scripted videos that they wind up robotically parroting them; they are driven “to leave their humanity at the door in order to be a perfect parent.” This ultimately doesn’t help their parenting, she adds: “Children sense inauthenticity a mile away, and it is confusing and uncomfortable for them. I’d much prefer an authentic, human response from a parent that is a bit messy and requires some apologizing and relationship repair later.”Like Rainbow, many of Caroline Dunlop’s clients at her psychology practice in New York are mothers seeking a road map for successful parenting. She has seen how a wrong turn on social media can push them deeper into anxiety instead: “Going online to see ‘what should I be doing now,’ that’s a form of reassurance-seeking that is likely unhelpful to a lot of parents,” she says. “The nuance that gets lost, the complexity that gets lost around individual human beings through these short clips is kind of the big problem… These social media clips introduce this idea of achievement and success with regards to parenting, and then, innately, that leads to a sense of ‘success’ versus ‘failure.’”Goykhberg, the parent of two in New York City, says the reels she found herself watching often made it seem like the ambiguous threat of failure was lurking in nearly every interaction with her child. “Gentle parenting in particular is so prescriptive,” she says. “There were a lot of times where I felt like, ‘What did so-and-so say yesterday in that Instagram post that I have to say in this moment, so I don’t break my child?’... There is so much pressure to say it correctly, with the right tone, with the right volume, making direct eye contact.”The stakes can feel especially high for parents dealing with more complex challenges. Raquel Gonçalves Lubbers has four children, all of whom were diagnosed with ADHD during the pandemic. Her social media feeds were full of conflicting guidance; she would scroll past one influencer arguing for a more permissive stance, followed by another emphasizing a more stern, authoritarian approach. “It feels more detrimental when you fall into the bad advice, if you’re parenting a neurodivergent kid,” she says.She decided to find her own answers and went back to school to study the neuroscience of ADHD. Last year, she became certified as an ADHD-focused family coach. Now, when parents ask her for the kind of specific instructions social media has taught them to seek, she reminds them that there is no one correct answer. “I can’t teach them what the solution to the problem is,” she says, “But I can teach them how to figure it out for themselves.”How to dig out from the avalanche? Some parents choose to log off. Others decide to more carefully curate their feed, retrain the algorithm and winnow down to a few trusted voices. Some opt to stick with their real-life communities for support.These days, Skye Klosterman is less likely to gravitate toward the social media accounts she once felt compelled to scour. A bombardment of scenario-specific reels doesn’t work for her, she realizes, but more comprehensive resources do; she found meaningful insights in Kennedy’s book, especially the concept that emotional repair with a child after a difficult moment or a parenting misstep is the most important thing — more important than not making a mistake in the first place.“In a lot of ways I do feel like a failure as a parent, but that is one way that I have always, always, always been consistent: I apologize to my kids when I mess up,” Klosterman says. “Bigger ideas like that — that is truly helpful.”With her clients, Dunlop says one of her biggest aims is to strengthen their trust in themselves, which also means building their tolerance for the uncertainty that comes with parenting. A 90-second video might offer one means to troubleshoot a meltdown — but the rush of new challenges won’t stop, and there is no way to ‘master’ a human relationship.“Parenting is all about ambiguity and unpredictability, and we have to have the stamina and endurance to ride this roller coaster for a long time,” Dunlop says. “There’s no finish line.”"
WaPo_71,"In sports, as in politics, stepping away can be a monumental task",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/14/eddie-robinson-willie-mays-joe-biden/,2024-07-19 20:06:03.067462,,"For more than half a century, or just about all his adult life, football was all Eddie Robinson did. It was his passion. It was his life.So in his elder years, when it appeared he no longer could perform what had been his calling, some around him began to whisper as much. A few began to voice their beliefs aloud. And, finally, painfully, a handful mustered the chutzpah to suggest to Coach Rob, as the legendary Grambling football coach was warmly nicknamed, that he pass his clipboard to a younger charge to protect his legacy.Some sage once told me that the hardest thing to do in sports is to manage the career of stars in their declining years, when they are no longer as swift and strong and sharp. Such as great Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, who wound up floundering in San Diego. Or future hockey Hall of Famer Jaromir Jagr, who rather than leave the NHL went to Calgary and suffered being waived. Or Willie Mays, of course. Or just about any champion boxer.But watching the final run of President Biden reminds that the same can be said of legendary politicians. Like Coach Rob, Biden has been at his passion for more than half a century — or just about all his adult life. It is his life. He served on the New Castle (Del.) County Council starting in 1970. He won election to the U.S. Senate in 1972 at 29 as one of the youngest senators in history. He went on to win reelection six times before becoming a two-term vice president.And now, just as Coach Rob refused the overtures that he step down — pleading for one more run, to finish what he started on his terms — President Biden, who is misspeaking more often and looking fatigued and fragile, is doing the same. Admittedly.“I always have an inclination, whether I was playing sports or doing politics,” Biden said at a news conference last week, “just to keep going, not stop.”It is difficult to watch. And it reminds of how journalists described Mays, the baseball great who died last month, in his final season. He couldn’t stop going, either, at 42 — maybe 81, Biden’s age, in baseball years.Mays was well past his prime then, batting .211 for the New York Mets. But they made it to the 1973 World Series. And what was most memorable, unfortunately, was Mays missing second base trying to go from first to third on a single by Rusty Staub in the ninth inning of Game 2. He then stumbled and fell. “Rather than embarrass myself, I stopped,” Mays said afterward. “I don’t know how it happened that I missed the bag. I guess it was trying to do two things at the same time — watch the ball and touch the bag.”In the bottom half of the ninth — in center field, the position he defined — Mays lost sight of a flyball, slipped and face-planted trying to make the catch. He didn’t. It turned into a double. “Ten years ago, he would have put that ball in his back pocket,” Curt Gowdy told the television audience.Biden is Mays in center field with the Mets now.“It’s devastating to say it,” actor George Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece last week, “but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.”“Halting” was one word used over and over to describe Biden’s debate last month with former president Donald Trump, himself two years shy of an 80th birthday.The thing is, Biden isn’t the first elected official who appears to have stayed for one term or campaign too many. Trump has misspoken in public, too, and lost his train of thought, whatever it is. There was Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who before she died last fall at 90 in her sixth decade in office often sounded confused on the floor. There is 82-year-old Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who announced in February, after two public episodes in which his face froze before cameras as he was speaking, that he is stepping down as the longest-serving Senate leader in history. He’s one of four octogenarians in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is 90. There are at least half a dozen U.S. representatives in their 80s.As the curtain on the last century was falling, Coach Rob was the winningest coach in college football history. He started coaching in Louisiana at historically Black Grambling in 1941. He won Black college championship after Black college championship. He saw 11 presidents inhabit the White House. He put more than 100 players in the NFL and several in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.But none of us can elude Mother Time. By the mid-1990s, in his late 70s, Coach Rob was losing more games than he was winning. His program was being investigated, too, by the NCAA for recruiting violations. Four players were charged with rape.Even the governor suggested it was time for Coach Rob to retire. But Coach Rob successfully lobbied for one more campaign in 1997 to go out as a winner. His Tigers won three games, the same as the season before.His most decorated player, quarterback Doug Williams, was chosen as his replacement. And still Coach Rob, 79 then, tried to run out the clock.Coach Rob continued to come to work. Williams was given a trailer behind the building where Coach Rob had his office. Williams told me last week he didn’t harbor any animosity toward the legend for whom he played, who didn’t avail him of his desk for months. Williams said he understood how hard it was to leave behind something you had worked at your entire life, especially on others’ terms rather than your own.One season after Coach Rob relinquished his title to Williams, the Tigers managed a winning season. Then they went 31-5 over the following three seasons, in which Williams restored the championship luster to what Coach Rob built.You can only imagine the momentum Grambling wouldn’t have lost had Coach Rob acceded earlier to the counsel of those around him. The growing chorus of those around President Biden sounds as if they are worried now about one day wondering the same."
WaPo_72,Paul Hollywood is right: Don’t refrigerate bread,https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/19/paul-hollywood-refrigerate-bread/,2024-07-19 20:05:03.067462,,"The refrigerator is a not-so-modern marvel. Over the decades, the appliance has fundamentally changed the way Americans shop, cook and eat, and they’re undeniably handy for prolonging the life of so many foods (yes, including tomatoes!).But people have zero chill over a recent proclamation by a recognized expert on something that isn’t best served by a trip to the fridge. Paul Hollywood, the cookbook author, TV personality and “Great British Baking Show” judge, recently posted a video on TikTok in which he proclaimed that the correct method of storage for bread is not inside an icebox.Did you know this about putting bread in the fridge? #bread #paulhollywood #baking #tips “A big question I get asked a lot — ‘where do you store bread?’” he starts off in the clip, which has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.“If you put your bread in the fridge, it will stale three times quicker because you’re drawing all the moisture out of the loaf,” he goes on to explain.Actually, while Hollywood is not wrong that moisture loss is bad for bread, it’s not the primary reason to avoid refrigerating bread. The science: Refrigeration speeds up the starches’ return to a more organized crystalline structure (also known as retrogradation), which means it hardens (i.e. stales) far faster. We’ve been telling readers this for years: A 1996 test by The Washington Post of various bread-storing methods concluded that “about the worst thing you can do is refrigerate the bread.”Science notwithstanding, it seems that Team Fridge is strong, and plenty of commenters took issue with the instructions from the guy who should know — after all, you don’t get called “the King of Bread” for nothing. Most of the naysayers lamented how quickly bread gets moldy when it’s not chilled. (This debate, I should note, plays out in my own household, and I sometimes find myself fishing a loaf out of the fridge, where my husband has stashed it.)“I say you wrong,” one commenter replied. “I keep mine in a sealed bag in the fridge and it keeps much better in than out.”“I keep mine in the fridge and it stays fresher longer,” said another.“OK Paul but if I keep it out it will mold from humidity,” was another representative lament.Hollywood, who says that he prefers to store his bread in a paper bag left out on the counter, isn’t the only bread expert (breadfluencer?) who insists that loaves don’t belong in the fridge. “You don’t want to put bread in the fridge, ever,” Andrew Janjigian, author of the bread-focused Wordloaf newsletter, told my colleague Aaron Hutcherson last year.For a crusty loaf, Janjigian prefers to store it cut-side down on the cutting board — a technique that my colleague Becky Krystal also employs at home.Commenters calling out Hollywood, though, do have a point. Unrefrigerated bread does typically get moldy faster. The trade-off is longevity over texture, and many consumers are more concerned with stretching their bread (and their metaphorical bread) as far as possible, especially these days.To which we say, fair. And also: freeze! Becky wrote a helpful guide to storing bread in that other section of your favorite appliance. She says the freezer “serves as a kind of pause button, meaning fresh bread you move into cold storage can come out almost as good as the day you put it in.”Her advice includes this smart tip: “Pre-sliced store-bought breads can be grouped into packets of a few slices each. Separate slices with pieces of parchment or wax paper if you think you’re more likely to use one slice at a time.”Sounds like a very cool solution."

WaPo_75,Trump uniting the country? That’s so last week.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/19/trump-unity-convention-gop-squandering/,2024-07-19 20:00:03.067462,,"After Saturday’s failed assassination attempt, Donald Trump said he wanted to “bring the country together” and “unite America.”It was about as plausible as President Biden announcing that he hopes to take up rugby.“In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United,” Trump proposed. That was on Sunday.On Monday, he demanded “the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts” — the legal cases against him — and referred to the case about his role in the 2021 attack on the Capitol as “the January 6th Hoax.” Wrote Trump: “The Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Joe Biden’s Political Opponent, ME.”On Tuesday, he denounced the “Radical Left Democrats” who “are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System.” The Uniter speculated that the “reason that these Communists are so despondent is that their unLawful Witch Hunts are failing everywhere.”That evening, the Republican National Convention showed a video in which Trump announced that “we must use every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats. They are destroying our country.” He added that “we must swamp the radical Democrats” who “cheat” in elections, “and frankly it’s the only thing they do well.”On Wednesday, Trump posted on Truth Social an image of him raising a fist after the assassination, juxtaposed with three photos of Biden stumbling on jet stairs. “TRUMP VS BULLET,” it said, and “BIDEN VS STAIRS.”By then, Trump allies at the GOP convention had called Democrats “jackals,” “corrupt,” “feckless,” “evil” and “Marxists” who tried to kill Trump. (The failed assassin was a registered Republican, and authorities have found no evidence of a political motive.)Ah, the warm courage of national unity.Then came Thursday night’s closing of the GOP’s unity convention.Eric Trump told the crowd his father had been “persecuted … by far-left Democrats,” and “ruthlessly silenced, slandered and attacked by a corrupt administration,” and he implied that “the swamp” was behind the attempted assassination.Hulk Hogan ended his convention address by saying: “All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags … and all you crooked politicians need to answer one question, brother: What you going to do when Donald Trump and all the Trump-a-maniacs run wild on you?”Trump himself, after a feint toward unity — “the discord and division in our society must be healed” — soon reverted to type. He complained about the “fake documents case against me” and the “partisan witch hunts.” He denounced “Crazy Nancy Pelosi” and invoked the “China virus.” He said Democrats “used covid to cheat” and called the United States a “nation in decline” with “totally incompetent leadership,” where there is “cheating on elections.”Despite his campaign’s claims (credulously swallowed by some in the press) that he wouldn’t mention Biden in his unifying speech, Trump told the convention that he would “take back the White House from Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country.” He then delivered his standard stump speech, packed with vitriol and fabrications.It looked like I had picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.I was already missing this week’s convention to go to a reunion, and the night before I departed, the would-be assassin came within an inch of killing the man Republicans were about to nominate for president. It was the sort of national trauma that had the potential to reshape politics.Trump, recognizing his close call had given him a huge opportunity to recast himself, vowed to unify the country. “It is a chance to bring the country together,” he told the Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito the next day. Biden and other Democratic leaders recognized the importance of rising above politics. They condemned the heinous act and expressed gratitude that Trump wasn’t seriously harmed. The news media embraced the talk of unity with a newly subdued and respectful tone.But it turns out I didn’t miss anything. The world didn’t stop, or even slow down. Republicans baselessly blamed Democrats for the shooting, and Biden and the Democrats went back to describing Trump as a liar and a felon and an aspiring autocrat. The press coverage went back to what it was before. And the public didn’t pay much attention to any of it.After the shooting, 16 million people watched coverage of the shocking event on broadcast and cable news, Nielsen figures showed. That was considerably fewer than the 24 million who had watched Biden’s news conference after the NATO summit a couple of days earlier. This was consistent with what I saw as I traveled across the country: People weren’t crowding around televisions or scrolling for news. On Tuesday, a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted after the shooting found that the presidential race was fundamentally unchanged, with Trump leading Biden by two percentage points, a statistical tie.The ho-hum reaction is not a good thing, for it shows that Americans are now so numb to gun violence, mass shootings and even political violence that we are no longer surprised by it. The indifference seen in the viewership and in the polls also provides more evidence that Americans have already made up their minds about this presidential contest — and that there is seemingly nothing that will change their minds as long as these two unpalatable candidates remain the choices.Biden’s spectacular flop at the debate may have nudged the polls a point or two in Trump’s favor, but it didn’t fundamentally alter the race. The assassination attempt didn’t either. The two candidates remain extremely unpopular. Most voters think Biden is too old and mentally unfit. Most voters think Trump is too dangerous and temperamentally unfit. Majorities wish both men would quit the race. (An Associated Press poll this week found that two thirds of Democrats want Biden out.) And they’ve tuned out this dreary and depressing presidential race. Can you blame them?The audience for the Biden-Trump debate, 51 million, was down nearly a third from the first Biden-Trump debate of 2020 and the least-watched in 20 years. Ratings for the GOP convention have been similarly lackluster; viewership for the first two nights was down about a quarter from 2016, the party’s last in-person convention.Were Trump a different man, he might well have had a chance to change the arc of the campaign after Saturday’s shooting. But in reality, Trump and his allies didn’t even pretend to embrace “unity,” even in the first 24 hours after the shooting. Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) alleged that “Joe Biden sent the orders” to shoot Trump and should be charged with “inciting an assassination.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) asserted: “The Democrat party is flat out evil, and yesterday they tried to murder President Trump.”Donald Trump Jr. blamed Biden for the shooting, which he said was a result of “calling my dad a ‘dictator’ and a ‘threat to Democracy.’” Right-wing commentators blamed antifa, MSNBC and “girl Secret Service agents.” Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.) wrote that “FAKE NEWS ‘outlets’ demonizing Trump and calling him Hitler are DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for this violent attack on President Trump’s life! They have BLOOD on their hands.”And Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), the man Trump would tap as his running mate, wrote on Saturday that the Biden campaign’s “rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination” by characterizing Trump as “an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.”Unity didn’t have a chance once the Republican convention opened Monday in Milwaukee. Organizers went ahead with plans to have Mark Robinson address the convention. The GOP candidate for governor of North Carolina, he recently spoke of “evil” opponents and said “some folks need killing.”Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) told the assembled that “Americans are dying — murdered, assaulted, raped — by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.”West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice warned that “we become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.”Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), the House GOP conference chair, denounced “corrupt Democrat prosecutors and judges.”House Speaker Mike Johnson (La.) said that “the radical woke progressive left” is trying to build a “borderless, lawless, Marxist, socialist utopia.”And Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) railed against the “radical” Democrats who pose “a clear and present danger to America.”How unifying! Asked about this by PBS, Johnson claimed that he had planned to give a more unifying address but somebody “loaded the wrong speech” on the teleprompter.Apparently, this was a common problem, for on and off the convention floor, Republicans used the opportunity for a reset given them by the assassination attempt to spout the most vile thoughts they could think.Speaker after speaker suggested Democrats were behind the shooting. “They tried to bankrupt him,” said Trump’s former housing secretary, Ben Carson. “They tried to put him in prison. … And then, last weekend, they tried to kill him.” Eric Trump agreed, telling CNN that “they tried to take his life.”Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) told Real America’s Voice that “they wanted to indict and imprison him” and “now they tried to kill him.”Ron Johnson told the same outlet that there were “rumors swirling” that the Secret Service had diverted agents from Trump’s detail to protect first lady Jill Biden. He, and others, blamed “DEI” — diversity, equity and inclusion — at the Secret Service, which is led by a woman, Kimberly Cheatle.The vitriol was gratuitous and ubiquitous. Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake began her convention speech by welcoming “everybody in this great arena tonight” before adding: “I don’t mean that. I don’t welcome everybody.” She then induced the crowd to boo the “fake news” journalists in attendance. (After Saturday’s shooting in Pennsylvania, the crowd immediately turned on the media, blaming them for the bloodshed — as did figures such as Rep. Chip Roy of Texas and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.)Trump adviser Chris LaCivita, who previously posted and deleted a message blaming Biden’s rhetoric for the attempted assassination, played off a fundraising appeal by Biden to say the president is sick “in the head.” Donald Trump Jr. told Axios that the only way Democrats could win in November was by cheating — and his sister-in-law, Lara Trump, now a top RNC official, concurred.Before a speech by former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, recently imprisoned for refusing to comply with a subpoena, organizers distributed posters that demanded “MASS DEPORTATION NOW.” Navarro told them Trump had been right in 2015 to say that migrants crossing the border are “murderers and rapists,” as well as “drug cartels, human traffickers, terrorists, Chinese spies and a whole army of illiterate illegal aliens stealing the jobs of Black, brown and blue-collar Americans.” Navarro also blamed “lawfare jackals” for firing “figurative and now literal bullets at Donald Trump.”A lot of the nastiness was transphobic; Greene used her speech to denounce the coincidence of Transgender Visibility Day, which has been observed on March 31 for 15 years, occurring on the same day as Easter Sunday this year. But migrants arguably received the most abuse. When Vance, in his acceptance speech Wednesday, said that “Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens,” the crowd chanted: “Send them back!”Even after days of such ugly displays at the convention, Vance praised Trump because “he called for national unity” after the shooting. “When Donald Trump rose to his feet in that Pennsylvania field, all of America stood with him,” Vance said.So it might have been. But Trump is squandering all the sympathy and goodwill — and any hope that the country might heal."

Trials for espionage in Russia typically take months.In Russia’s highly politicized legal system, where the courts routinely are used to jail journalists, democracy advocates, human rights activists and political opponents of the government, Gershkovich’s conviction had appeared inevitable since his arrest.Gershkovich’s arrest in March 2023 seemed to mark a brazen new chapter in hostage diplomacy, by which the Kremlin details foreigners on baseless charges only to use them to negotiate exchanges for Russians convicted of serious crimes in the West.Senior Russian and U.S. officials have said that talks about an exchange involving Gershkovich are underway but, according to Kremlin policy, would only proceed once the trial was over.Gershkovich, his employer The Wall Street Journal and the State Department have all strongly denied the accusation that he was working for the CIA. His conviction was widely expected.The 32-year-old, who was accredited as a journalist by Russia’s Foreign Ministry, was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg and accused of spying. He pleaded not guilty.A conviction would at least open the possibility that Gershkovich could be released if the United States can reach a deal with Russia. The second day of the trial, at the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in Yekaterinburg, was moved forward to Thursday from Aug. 13 at the request of Gershkovich’s defense team, according to the court.Russian prosecutors alleged that Gershkovich was operating on the orders of the CIA, gathering secret information about Uralvagonzavod, a state-owned machine-building factory in Nizhniy Tagil, about 87 miles southeast of Yekaterinburg, which manufactures tanks for Russia’s war on Ukraine.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said last month that the case against Gershkovich was “not about evidence, procedural norms, or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives.”Fueling the sense that the result was a political inevitability, senior Russian officials immediately denounced the journalist after his arrest in March last year. Within hours, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had proclaimed that his work in Yekaterinburg had “nothing to do with journalism” and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted that Gershkovich had been “caught red-handed.” Neither offered evidence.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday that Russia had “irrefutable evidence” that the reporter had spied and claimed that the use of journalists as spies “at least in the Anglo-Saxon world, is a tradition.” But he confirmed that Russian and U.S. intelligence services were in contact on the possibility of an exchange.In February, President Vladimir Putin indicated he would be willing to exchange Gershkovich for a “patriot” who had “eliminated a Russian bandit” in a European capital, an apparent reference to Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, associated with Russia’s Federal Security Service. Krasikov was convicted of murder in Germany for fatally shooting a former Chechen rebel commander, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, in broad daylight in a Berlin park in 2019.Last month, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was awaiting a response from Washington to its exchange offer. He said “the ball is in the United States’ court. We are waiting for their response to the ideas that were presented to them.”Ryabkov said the Kremlin had “repeatedly emphasized that the United States” should “seriously consider the signals” Moscow had sent to Washington about possible deals but did not detail the proposals.“I understand that the Americans are probably not happy with something in these ideas. That’s their problem,” he said.Gershkovich’s conviction is likely to have a further chilling effect on the work of foreign journalists in Russia. Many media organizations pulled their correspondents out of Russia after his arrest in March last year.Gershkovich is the first American journalist arrested in Russia for alleged spying since 1986, during the Cold War, when Nicholas Daniloff, a correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was detained by the Soviet security service. Daniloff was held for 13 days before being freed without facing trial in exchange for Gennadi Zakharov, who had been arrested by the FBI in New York for spying in a sting operation.The United Nations’ Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions this month called on Russia to free Gershkovich without a trial and to pay him compensation. It concluded that, “There is a striking lack of any factual or legal substantiation provided by the authorities of the Russian Federation for the espionage charges” against him.His arrest was “designed to punish his reporting” on Russia’s war against Ukraine, “lacked a legal basis and is arbitrary,” the U.N. working group said.Associates of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in jail in Russia in February, said that there was nearly an agreement that month on a deal exchanging Krasikov for Navalny and two Americans.That exchange probably would have involved Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, an American serving a 16-year jail term in Russia after being convicted in 2020 of spying. The State Department has designated Gershkovich and Whelan as wrongly detained.One of Navalny’s closest associates, Maria Pevchikh, reported that the prisoner exchange talks were in their final stages on Feb. 15, the day before Navalny was reported dead. Pevchikh has alleged that Putin decided to have Navalny killed to sabotage the deal, rather than free him.The Kremlin has denied any role in Navalny’s death. In March, Putin confirmed that a person had put a deal on exchanging Navalny to him shortly before he died, adding that he immediately agreed, on condition that Navalny never return to Russia.“I agreed under one condition: we swap him, and he doesn’t come back. But such is life,” said Putin. “When things like that happen you cannot do anything about it. That’s life,” he said referring to Navalny’s death.Whelan, 54, has spent more than five and a half years in prison in Russia, having been overlooked in two previous exchange deals.The American WNBA star Brittney Griner, convicted in Moscow of drug smuggling in August 2022, was freed in an exchange that December for Viktor Bout, a convicted Russian arms trafficker.Former Marine Trevor Reed, convicted of assaulting a police officer, was freed in April 2022 in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been jailed in the United States for drug smuggling."
WaPo_77,An elephant left a troubled zoo. Advocates fear her life got worse.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/natural-bridge-asha-two-tails/,2024-07-19 21:59:02.915084,,"Last year it seemed like Asha was finally heading for the storybook retirement she deserved.The now-41-year-old elephant had lived a bruising, lonely life. She was plucked from the African Savannah when she was a baby, then spent the majority of her days at the troubled Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. There she gave hundreds of rides a day, and allegedly lived chained up in a dirty barn, swaying to “soothe herself and relieve boredom and stress,” a witness would say.Animal advocates spent years calling for her release. Some went undercover with hidden cameras to film her conditions. They filed complaints with state authorities. A billboard went up calling for her release. And in December 2023, when Virginia officials announced they had raided Natural Bridge and confiscated hundreds of animals, they thought their campaign had worked.It hadn’t. In June, Natural Bridge posted on Facebook that Asha had been “retired to a sanctuary.” But records show that days prior to the raid, Asha was moved to Two Tails Ranch, another privately-owned zoo in Florida that had been investigated by state authorities and been the subject of numerous complaints by animal rights groups.Advocates are now worried she’s gone from one bad situation to another.“We have been successful to a greater or lesser degree campaigning for animals to get their freedom. We had hoped to do that with Asha,” said Fleur Dawes, director of communications and international partnerships for In Defense of Animals (IDA), an international nonprofit that advocates for the release of elephants from zoos and circuses. “It’s heartbreaking.”Natural Bridge Zoo and Two Tails Ranch did not respond to multiple questions about Asha’s removal to Florida and her current situation.Like many elephants populating American zoos and circuses, Asha was taken from her mother when she was around 2 years old, according to an online database that has tracked the location and movements of nearly 9,000 elephants living in captivity since 1995.She eventually ended up at Natural Bridge in 1985. The abrupt transition to the zoo likely had a deep impact on her mental health, according to Courtney Scott, an elephant consultant for IDA.“That’s a young age and right there you have trauma,” Scott said. “Then she’s taken to a place where she has to do riding, and the training for that is always brutal. She really has had no time or opportunity to do anything else but be exploited.”IDA first raised alarms about Asha’s living conditions in 2014, when Natural Bridge was listed first on the organization’s “Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants” ranking. The organization alleged Asha was kept in isolation, forced to carry riders and trained using a bullhook, a steel-tipped training tool that earlier this year was banned in Virginia.That same year, an investigator with the Humane Society of the United States went undercover as an employee at the facility from May through October 2014. The investigator filmed discussions with Natural Bridge’s staff, including conversations about Asha.The videos indicate the staff viewed Asha as a potential threat rather than an animal in their care.“One of the worst things you can ever do to an elephant is let it learn that it can make a decision,” a trainer said in the video. “The only time you hit an elephant is for intimidation, to show them that you can.”Years later, a Natural Bridge employee would testify to state investigators that they often saw Asha chained up in a barn, left standing in her own urine and feces. The witness reported seeing Asha give 359 rides over a two-day period.Elephant rides, as well as other tourism experiences involving physical contact between animals and guests, have been increasingly on the wane due to media campaigns by groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and World Animal Protection. In 2016, the popular online travel booking site Tripadvisor announced it would no longer sell tickets to excursions involving human-animal interactions — a direct result of conversations between the company and animal rights groups.In December 2023, Virginia state officials announced they had raided Natural Bridge, part of an animal cruelty investigation that sought to rehome the animals in new facilities and sanctuaries.One hundred and twenty animals were taken from Natural Bridge during the December 2023 search. Included in the roundup was a white Bengal tiger that veterinarians determined had to be euthanized. At a six-day jury trial earlier this year, a jury sided with the state, awarding custody of 71 animals to regulators.Asha, however, had been removed before Virginia authorities came knocking.“Had she been on [the] property, she would have been seized in the raid and probably now would be at an actual elephant sanctuary,” said Robin Vitulle, president of Free All Captive Elephants (FACE), a national nonprofit that advocates for the release of elephants from zoos and circuses. “It’s devastating that she was not on property.”Two Tails Ranch sits on 67 acres outside of Gainesville, Fla. Founded in 1984, the ranch is currently owned and managed by Patricia Zerbini, whose family has run a touring circus for decades. In a 2021 interview with the Ocala Gazette, Zerbini said Two Tails was not an elephant sanctuary or rescue but a privately-owned facility offering visitors an up-close experience with elephants.Elephants are central to Two Tails, according to the facility’s website. Among its offerings: guided tours of the sanctuary — $20 dollars for adult admission — as well as $5 for the opportunity to feed an elephant; $25 for a photo opportunity; and $40 per person for an elephant ride. For $200, a visitor can get an “extreme experience” that is “one of its kind found in the United States and Canada” that includes up-close time with an elephant.Elephants can also be rented from Two Tails for “special occasions and private parties,” including “traditional Indian ceremonies Weddings, Bharat, etc. Museums, schools, hospitals, zoos, fairs, circuses, display, private parties, parades, republican conventions [sic].”Two Tails has also been the subject of complaints from animal rights groups, leading to scrutiny from state and federal regulators. The facility was cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for failing to quarantine and contain elephants exposed to tuberculosis in 2011, 2008 and 2005. The USDA also cited Two Tails in 2013, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2005 and 2004 for failing to have proper fencing and sturdy housing in place for elephants.In December 2001, Two Tails paid a $2,250 civil penalty to the USDA to settle past violations of federal regulations, such as failure to give proper veterinary care to an elephant, failure to provide elephants with shade, and failing to maintain clean premises, according to records complied by PETA.In August 2013, Two Tails’s lack of secure perimeter fencing led to an elephant attacking a woman who had approached the animal to take a picture. The attack resulted in life-threatening injuries to the woman, and Two Tails was fined $857, according to the Ocala StarBanner.Last December, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also began an investigation into Asha’s relocation from Natural Bridge to Two Tails. In an official report submitted to the state and reviewed by The Washington Post, a Florida-based veterinarian claimed the animal was moved to Florida, before the raid, due to a “critical veterinary case.” But Florida officials had never issued the permit for Asha to be transferred.The vet emailed state officials about the transfer on Dec. 1, when Asha was already in a trailer leaving Virginia for Florida. In an interview with investigators, the vet said “he could not wait 90 days for a permit and there was no way for him to contact FWC to do what he needed to do quickly” due to what the investigator’s reported said were gastrointestinal issues “that may have been related to previous dental issues.”Two Tails’s Zerbini, however, told investigators she had been told the proper permits were in place for Asha’s transfer. She added the elephant “did not have a medical emergency but knew at one time she had a bad tooth,” according to the commission’s report.“It made more sense,” the report noted, for the Florida vet who signed off on the documents to “travel to [Natural Bridge Zoo] rather than the elephant be transported to Florida.” As such, the investigator concluded Asha had been shipped “into Florida without acquiring an approved importation permit.”A written warning was issued to the Florida-based veterinarian involved in the transfer. (The veterinarian did not respond to a request for comment.)Two Tails’s owner and the Florida vet denied the move was prompted by a tip-off about the Virginia raid, according to the report. Zerbini told state investigators she had been talking with Natural Bridge’s management about taking on Asha since 2019. She also “implied that the circumstances surrounding the Natural Bridge search warrant was nonsense,” the Florida report noted.The report also presented a snapshot of Asha’s new conditions — igniting new fears among advocates about the animal’s Florida life.According to the document, a Florida state investigator visited Asha at Two Tails in late December 2023. The elephant then appeared in good health and had no apparent “wounds including those indicative of misuse of a bullhook,” the report said.But the document also noted that Asha’s trainer “was somewhat antagonistic towards me,” and “his first words to me were him ordering me not to call the elephant by name,” the official wrote. The report noted when Asha blew water in the investigator’s direction, the trainer responded “she was a good elephant for spitting on me.”A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said there are currently no open investigations into Two Tails.But for the advocates across the country who have followed Asha’s life and worked for her release, her removal and new home feels like an opportunity lost.“Because she was technically moved illegally, does that mean this could be reversed?” said Denise Gaug, a longtime volunteer with FACE. “We don’t know. It’s an unprecedented situation.”"
WaPo_78,"Virginia hopefuls woo support at RNC with oyster buffets, charter bus chats",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/virginia-delegation-gop-convention/,2024-07-19 21:59:02.915084,,"MILWAUKEE — The Republican National Convention wasn’t just for GOP hopefuls named Trump and Vance.From the U.S. House and Senate candidates who will be down-ballot in November to the Republicans who are not running this year but see a future governor or president in the mirror, the convention was a chance to court home-state activists, schmooze national donors and otherwise attempt to pump up their prospects.While up-and-comers from every state hope national conventions can help them up and come, Virginia seemed to send a bumper crop of them to the RNC. The self-proclaimed “Mother of Presidents” is never short on ambitious politicians — even if it hasn’t delivered a native son to the White House since Woodrow Wilson. And so a bunch of declared and potential candidates were scrambling to boost their profiles and bottom lines in Milwaukee, some 900 miles away from the usual center of their political universe in Richmond.Among those on the ballot in Virginia this year and on the ground in Wisconsin this week was U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao, who got the chance to deliver a short convention speech — exposure that might help his uphill bid to unseat Sen. Tim Kaine (D). State Sen. John J. McGuire III (R-Goochland), who is favored to win Virginia’s red 5th Congressional District after narrowly besting Rep. Bob Good in a fierce GOP primary last month (although a recount awaits), came away with tips on how to staff an office in Washington.Then there were the likely 2025 contenders rubbing elbows with party activists at the Virginia delegation’s convention hotel and charter buses: Attorney General Jason S. Miyares (R), who is widely expected to run for governor, and Richmond talk-radio host John Reid, who is publicly mulling a bid for lieutenant governor.Most prominent of all was Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R). He seemed to be laying the groundwork for a 2028 presidential bid by addressing key primary-state delegations, meeting privately with megadonors and treating more than 1,000 convention-goers to a bash with Virginia oysters and a live band.Youngkin, who teased but never launched a 2024 run, got even more exposure with a prime-time convention speaking slot, a turn sitting beside former president Donald Trump in the convention hall and last-minute, frenzied speculation that he might be Trump’s running mate. That made for lots of buzz, even if Trump’s pick turned out to be Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).Youngkin and other potential and declared candidates in the convention swirl said they were focused on delivering their blue-leaning state to Trump, who has been neck-and-neck with President Biden in recent polls despite a 10-point loss to Biden in Virginia in 2020.“Every head should have a hat, every bumper sticker should be on a car, every yard a sign,” Youngkin told the South Carolina delegation at breakfast Tuesday, winding up a 20-minute speech that also touched on the governor’s humble roots and political wins that spanned from getting “masks off kids” to trimming wait times at the Department of Motor Vehicles. “Campaigns need funding. Campaigns need hands and feet. We’ve got to do the work.”Yet even the most loyal Trump-Vance soldiers could benefit if some of the funds, hands and feet they activate for the ticket make their way to their own campaigns this year or down the road.Reid, the WRVA radio host considering a bid for lieutenant governor next year, headed to the convention with exploratory campaign literature and with plans to introduce himself to Republicans who live outside his metro Richmond listening area.“The people who are going are spending a fortune, and they are dedicated Republicans in Virginia,” Reid, the son of a former state delegate, said in an interview a few days before leaving for Milwaukee. “And they’re from some parts of Virginia where my show is probably not on their radar.”Even before he checked in at his convention hotel, Reid was making connections. Stuck in the lobby of the Hilton Garden Inn while housekeepers prepped the rooms, he struck up a conversation with Mike Rose, a similarly marooned Republican activist from Stafford County.Rose knew Reid from his show and had met him twice before, but now they had a real chance to chat. That was the first Rose had heard about any campaign plans for Reid, who once served as communications chief for Virginia governor George Allen (R) and would be Virginia’s first openly gay statewide official.“It’d be cool,” Rose said. “I like him.”Reid spent each day flipping from interviewer to interviewee, broadcasting his radio show from his hotel room every morning, then dashing to media booths to be quizzed as a potential 2025 candidate hailing from a seemingly competitive 2024 state.“People seem to be very interested in Virginia being in play,” he said by text message at the end of a week he found “exhausting … but great.”Congressional candidate McGuire, on the other hand, needed no introduction after appearing to edge out Good in a bitter June 18 primary that drew gobs of national attention and cash. State-certified results (now subject to the recount) put Good, nationally prominent as chairman of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, 374 votes behind McGuire, who was backed by an unlikely alliance of Trump and establishment Republicans.While on the convention floor, McGuire said he was surprised by how many delegates from other states recognized him and offered congratulations. Members of the Hawaii delegation even gave the former Navy SEAL a lei upon learning that he has a son stationed with the Navy in their state.Jessi Blakely, a Virginia activist who lives outside the 5th District in Mechanicsville, found herself chatting with McGuire while in line to board a delegation bus to an afternoon event. Chairwoman of Virginia Young Republicans until about 18 months ago, Blakely, 27, offered to tap her ties to chapters in his district for volunteer door-knockers. She offered national connections, too, that could help him staff up his congressional office if he beats Democrat Gloria Witt in November’s general election.“Because I’ve been involved at the national level with the young Republicans, I know some folks who staff congressional offices with young people and so I connected him to a great organization in D.C. that kind of pipelines people from internships to offices,” Blakely said.To be sure, there are plenty of Republican candidates in Virginia and elsewhere who saw a political advantage to steering clear of the convention, particularly if they are running in swing districts or states where Trump plays poorly.Former Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a longtime Trump critic now running for U.S. Senate in the deep-blue state, stayed away. So did Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R), the first Black woman elected to statewide office. Like Miyares, the attorney general and first Hispanic to win statewide, Earle-Sears is considering a run for governor next year.Earle-Sears had stumped across the country for Trump’s reelection in 2020 but called him a “liability to the mission” and urged him to leave the political stage two years later, in the aftermath of disappointing midterm elections. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment about why she skipped the convention.Putting some distance between herself and Trump might help Earle-Sears in a general election but hurt her in a GOP primary, political analysts say. At least one Virginia delegate was not upset with Earle-Sears, who is known for speaking her mind.“Winsome Sears is a rock star.” said Curt Lilly, 59, an engineer from Waynesboro. “She’s fearless.”The convention caused a little agita for at least a few candidates who love Trump but face voters in November and hated to take time off from knocking on doors back home. That includes McGuire, a vocal 2020 election denier who has been flying Trump flags off the back of his Ford pickup since 2016.McGuire readily agreed when Trump’s campaign invited him months ago to serve as an RNC delegate — though he was wary of taking what he thought would be one day off the campaign trail. Only as the event drew near did he realize it would last the better part of a week.But he went with no regrets.“Anything,” he said, “for the team.”"

WaPo_80,‘EA Sports College Football’ is back. Real college football players love it.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/ea-sports-college-football-real-players/,2024-07-19 21:56:02.915084,,"DALLAS — Like you, maybe, college football players have spent a lot of this week with a controller in their hands. The difference is that, when they fire up “EA Sports College Football 25,” they’re actually in the game again, which is the whole reason it returned after an 11-year break.The full release of the game was Friday, though players received their deluxe copies earlier. On top of that copy, they were paid $600 each for the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Cover stars such as Texas’s Quinn Ewers, Colorado’s Travis Hunter and Michigan’s Donovan Edwards made much more.“I didn’t have crazy high expectations for my rating,” Missouri quarterback Brady Cook said Tuesday at SEC Media Days in Dallas. “I wasn’t expecting to be a 95 or 96. We’ll save that for Luther. I just wanted to be 85 or above and I’d be happy, and I turned out an 88. So I’ll smile.”Luther is wide receiver Luther Burden III, Cook’s top target and a preseason Heisman candidate. With his 94 rating, he is also tied for the third-best player in the game. On Sunday, Burden and Cook faced off at Burden’s apartment, both choosing to play with Missouri. Cook, glued to the screen, put up 600 passing yards and more than 150 on the ground in a win.With himself, of course. Finally.But are coaches worried about their guys playing too much ahead of the upcoming season?“Well, I know three of them that aren’t going to get to it until later, which is a good thing, because they’re here with me,” Clark Lea, Vanderbilt’s coach, cracked in Dallas. “If it were me, I’d be playing that game. They’re going to play it. Listen, we message this all the time: There’s always sacrifice in what we do, which includes that there is a time when we have to turn it off and go to bed.”Billy Napier, Florida’s coach, already dealt with a tired player at Media Days this week. It being the offseason still, running back Montrell Johnson Jr. copped to playing the game until 2 a.m. But it’s not as if the program has shied away from it, either.“We had early access to the game and we had our team in our Gator Room, we broke our accountability teams into a bracket,” Napier said. “They had to select two players to play for each team. We had four stations set up. We had pizza. We had wings. And, man, I’m going to tell you, you talk about competing. You talk about energy in the room. I mean, it was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.”Here is football tradition clashing with the modern business of college sports. At Vanderbilt, sacrifice now includes shutting down the video game you were paid to appear in. At Florida, your accountability group doubled as your College Football 25 teammates.Before July 1, 2021, when the NCAA changed its rules to allow college athletes to earn NIL money, those sentences would have been unthinkable. Sure, the hypocrisy was clear, especially because O’Bannon v. NCAA — the landmark case that led to athletes’ NIL rights — stemmed from Ed O’Bannon seeing himself in a video game and wondering why he hadn’t received a dime.Then, the avatar looked like O’Bannon, a former UCLA basketball player, and wore his No. 31. But in an effort to avoid the legal liability to pay athletes, the NCAA and EA Sports just didn’t use their names. You know, amateurism and all.So that this game exists, and that the athletes are profiting, is a loud, blinking sign of the times. Not every player, however, will have Cook’s experience, commanding the game with his own tiny player. Not every player, for that matter, will have the chance to control himself at all.Take Trey Zuhn III, an offensive lineman for Texas A&M: “You can’t really play as a left tackle.”Or Gunnar Hansen, an offensive lineman for Vanderbilt: “I guess I’ll just cuss myself out if I’m not playing well.”Or Debo Williams, a South Carolina linebacker: “Just shutting everything down. Getting interceptions, getting sacks, wreaking havoc, getting turnovers.”“I did see there weren’t any South Carolina players with a 90 rating or above,” said Williams, who didn’t seek out his own rating ahead of time. “They’re trying to come for our season already, man.”"
WaPo_81,A month that upended the campaign leaves Trump in his strongest position yet,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/trump-biden-convention-analysis/,2024-07-19 21:21:02.915084,,"MILWAUKEE — As Republicans break camp at the conclusion of their national convention, the presidential campaign has taken a turn that no Hollywood scriptwriter would have dared imagine, opening a cavernous gap in moods inside the two major parties. Suddenly, Republicans are as sky-high and confident as Democrats are down and discouraged.Within the past month, cascading events have changed the dynamic and possibly the ultimate trajectory of the election. Leaving his convention, former president Donald Trump is in a stronger position politically than at any point in the campaign, or for that matter in any of the three campaigns he has run since he was first a candidate in 2016.Meanwhile, many Democrats despair that President Biden could lead them to a broad defeat that could leave the White House, House and Senate in Republican control. But they also worry that, even if the president yields to calls to step aside, a possible replacement, whether Vice President Harris or one of several governors talked about as possible candidates, would carry significant risks as well.This campaign has long been something of a contradiction: static but potentially volatile. It has had stability as seen in most national and many swing-state polls. While those polls have shown Trump with a narrow advantage over Biden, the margins have been small and relatively stable — until now.Despite that, the campaign has always had an element of instability due to a sour electorate, with voters broadly unhappy about their choice of candidates, which leaves questions about how many will actually vote. Then there’s the potential impact of unpredictable events and known unknowns. The past month has brought that part of the campaign to the forefront.This cycle of events began with the disastrous June 27 debate performance by Biden. Next came the Supreme Court’s ruling that presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts, a victory for Trump that probably assures that he will not face trial before the election in the federal case that brought charges for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.Last Saturday came the shocking assassination attempt against Trump and his clenched-fist response as he was led offstage, bloodied, by Secret Service agents. On Monday, a federal judge in Florida dismissed charges related to his handling of classified documents. And starting later that day, Republicans produced a convention here in Milwaukee that highlighted a party that has been reshaped in Trump’s image and with delegates fully united behind their nominee.The contrast between the state of the parties at midsummer was sharpened further this week with reports of Democratic disunity. Senior Democratic leaders — Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) — had warned Biden that he could take down his whole party by staying in the race. And then, on Wednesday, came the news that Biden had been diagnosed with covid-19, forcing him off the campaign trail.Judgments about the two candidates and the current state of the race are telling.“If the Democrats persist in nominating Joe Biden, at this point they’re essentially conceding the presidency to Donald Trump,” Republican pollster Whit Ayres said. “Trump waving his fist in the face of an assassin is the very picture of strength. You put that alongside Joe Biden’s vacant stare during the debate and he is the very picture of weakness.”A Democrat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide a candid assessment of the state of the campaign offered a similar if less harsh view. Republicans today, this strategist said, remind him of Democrats in 2008 when Barack Obama was running his first campaign. Republicans, he said, are “psyched, 100 percent behind their guy … and they think they’re going to win.”Democrats need a shot in the arm, he added, “to reset and get that feeling back. That means getting a new nominee, any nominee.” If that happens, he said, “I think we will be excited and get absolutely pumped up and feel we can be competitive again.”Still, however good the past few weeks have been for Trump or bad for Biden, the basic contours of this election haven’t entirely disappeared. Trump, for all his current strengths, remains a candidate with flaws and vulnerabilities.The average of national polls now gives Trump a lead of between two and three percentage points, representing a small shift in his direction since the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta. A CBS/YouGov poll released Thursday showed Trump at 52 percent, Biden at 47 percent, Trump’s largest lead of the campaign. A July 3 poll showed Trump at 50 percent, Biden at 48 percent.Electoral college projections, based only in part on polling, show a deteriorating map for Biden, with states such as Virginia, New Hampshire and Minnesota that the president won in 2020 and counted as almost certainly in his column now seen as potentially competitive, though more evidence is needed to make a fuller assessment.Biden has been dismissive of the public polls and of reports that some private polls show movement in Trump’s direction. His campaign continues to say it sees a path to victory, one that runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Winning those three states would put Biden at 270 electoral votes, the minimum needed, which includes a single vote from one of Nebraska’s congressional districts. The Post’s average of polls shows Wisconsin tied, Trump with a lead of less than a percentage point in Pennsylvania and Trump with a lead of three points in Michigan.The final months will be focused on two overriding questions. The most immediate is whether Biden decides to step aside. The Democratic National Convention is now a month away, which leaves limited time for the party to find another candidate and to unify around that person if Biden decides to end his candidacy.Party officials are starting to put in place the mechanisms for an early virtual roll call of delegates that could take place in early August — before delegates arrive in Chicago. That virtual roll call, seen by party leaders as necessary to ensure that their nominee qualifies for all state ballots, could be used to nominate Biden — or a possible successor. If Biden is not a candidate by then, the party will face the choice of open competition or a quick consolidation around Harris.The second question is whether, after a generally successful convention, Trump reverts to past practices and behavior — as a candidate given to wild claims, grievances, lies about the 2020 election being stolen and sometimes rambling discourse that can put a focus on the fact that he is, at 78, only a few years younger than Biden.His Thursday night acceptance speech, a lengthy and often meandering address, included touches that his advisers hoped to see, such as pledges to unify the country. His description of the assassination attempt was moving, and to many in the audience emotional. But his speech contained many more flashes of the Trump the country had long ago come to know.When he got to the issues, including immigration, the speech included oft-used distortions and falsehoods repeated from the campaign trail. He also made some extravagant promises, from claiming he will “end every single international crisis that the current administration has created,” to an assertion that “incomes … will skyrocket” if he is elected.With so much focus on Biden’s debate performance and the turmoil within the Democratic Party about his future as a candidate, Trump has enjoyed a month with little scrutiny. The assassination attempt brought him sympathy and admiration in the eyes of many voters. His convention amounted to a four-night infomercial for the candidate and nightly criticism of Biden’s record on inflation, immigration and national security.Republican strategists argue that the smartest course for Trump from here is to be steady rather than provocative, calm rather than inflammatory, a steady-as-you-go campaign that keeps attention on Biden’s record and avoids unforced errors. But Trump is nothing if not predictable. He has never before exhibited such sustained restraint and message discipline, and his record remains the single most powerful motivator for Democratic voters to turn out in November.Democrats will have their own convention to prosecute the case against Trump, and they have been preparing for months. The Biden campaign has sought to elevate Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s controversial policy blueprint for a second Trump term. Trump has tried to distance himself from the project, even though many who served in his first administration and are seen as likely candidates for a future second one have been instrumental in its drafting.The turmoil surrounding Biden’s candidacy comes at a time when the candidate and his party should be putting the final touches on their own convention and making the case against Trump. Instead, they are caught up in an unprecedented internal debate that is costing them time, energy and unity. What they will need is not just unity but enthusiasm that can produce the high levels of voter turnout that brought victories in 2018 and 2020, and that turned back the anticipated Republican wave in 2022.Trump can expect some gains from his convention, but if history is a guide, those can fade. At some point, after the Democratic convention, the campaign should settle back into familiar patterns, with two nominees and two parties locked in competition for the White House.When that happens, the question will be whether Democrats will be able to rebound from what has become a low point in the campaign and make the contest as competitive as was predicted when it began."

WaPo_84,‘EA Sports College Football 25’ is like reliving your best college years,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/07/19/ea-sports-college-football-25-review/,2024-07-19 22:59:02.891507,,"There’s a palpable energy surrounding “EA Sports College Football 25.” A long-awaited revival to a franchise that’s lain dormant for 11 years, the game has already garnered attention from celebrities like LeBron James, Shane Gillis and Tim Tebow, who all streamed it on Twitch last weekend. In many ways, the hype around “College Football 25” is like the first day of college — lots of sights, sounds and triumphant messaging, with uncertainty about what the future holds.But once you get going, there’s no looking back. You’ll be here for a good time, and a long time.“College Football 25,” which comes out Friday on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, is the successor to “NCAA Football 14,” a game released in the summer of 2013 that has developed a hero reputation among college football fans. EA stopped releasing college football video games because of legal issues surrounding name, image and likeness deals with players. But once the NCAA opened the way for players to profit off NIL deals in 2019, EA was quick to bring back the franchise. The newest rendition was announced in February 2021, and the earliest access to the game began this past Monday.Naturally, the first true college football game in over a decade will raise some eyebrows. Does it hold up to the originals? Is it just a re-skinned version of the juggernaut Madden NFL video games? And is “College Football 25” actually fun?Like many sports games, “College Football 25” is easy to pick up but difficult to master. The new passing system will take some getting used to, since it has a number of custom controls and requires timing a meter while reading an opposing defense all at once (you’ll need to stay locked in to hit your passes). Defense, just like in actual college football, is hard to come by and will require patience. For as much fun as you have moving the chains, you’ll need to take some time to understand how the game works and which players work best for your team’s scheme.Your difficulty setting will define your experience. The second-lowest setting (“varsity”) brought me a pair of exciting games (Massachusetts vs. Brigham Young and Texas vs. Georgia) that went down to the wire, filled with high-octane offense and heartbreaking pick-sixes. The highest setting — the dreaded “Heisman” difficulty — should be used by only those who wish to worship the CPU as the new overlord of college football. In my first “Heisman” encounter, the Texas Christian Horned Frogs stomped my Southern Methodist Mustangs, 63-0 (using three-minute quarters, mind you). (I should note I’m a casual Madden player, so you might do better if you’re more experienced with that game.)That said, this isn’t a Madden NFL re-skin. Madden games tend to be chunky, bloated, slow and dark. “College Football 25” is bright, fast-paced, ridiculous and wild. You get high scores, deep throws and raucous crowds. The vibrant colors and intense atmosphere of college football made all of my blowout losses (we’ll see you again soon, Eastern Michigan) much less painful.Any fan of the NCAA Football franchise will point to “Dynasty Mode” — in which you take control of the recruiting and on-field performance of a college football program — as the go-to. This revived version is incredibly deep with a heavy emphasis on recruiting, which requires you to plan how to spend your allotted time, whom to recruit and where to look for players. It’s a fun experience for menu merchants and creatives (I spent an hour working my way through my prospect list instead of hitting the field), but it won’t excite everyone who wants to dive right into play.Similarly, “Road to Glory,” the role-playing mode in which you create a custom college athlete, can have you stuck in the dorm room rather than on the field. As a bench player in year one, I spent two hours using my allocated “energy” coins on studying and teammate bonding, with a few minutes performing practice drills. I didn’t see game time until the final game of the season. So if you want to hop right into the action, make sure you pick a “starter” spot from the get-go. (Just be careful not to get blocked by your college crush!)There’s no question “College Football 25” is worth buying and a welcome return to the franchise. At times, you’ll find yourself picking apart defenses and scoring wildly entertaining touchdowns. On its worst day, you’ll be stuck in the menu for an hour trying to recruit a quarterback from Riverside, Calif., or studying for an upcoming exam (which is its own puzzle).The game is truly a combination of work hard, play harder — sounds a lot like college."

WaPo_86,Congress passes bill to impose strict scrutiny on embattled prison agency,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/congress-bureau-of-federal-prisons-oversight-bill/,2024-07-19 22:33:02.891507,,"Maybe now, finally, sunlight will pierce the concealing walls of the embattled and scorned Bureau of Prisons (BOP).After decades of complaints and years of investigations, Congress has approved a strict level of scrutiny on an agency in crisis that is responsible for the lives of almost 160,000 inmates in 122 prisons.Last week, with overwhelming bipartisan support during an era of nasty partisanship, the Senate voted for the Federal Prison Oversight Act with no senator objecting. The House vote in May was nearly unanimous, 392-2, with only Republican Reps. Paul A. Gosar (Ariz.) and Matt Rosendale (Mont.) dissenting.The bill, which must be signed by President Biden, will not immediately improve BOP’s many endemic problems, notably understaffing and failing facilities. Its significance is in the transparency it imposes on an agency that houses a population unable to advocate for itself.“They always say sunlight is the best disinfectant. So, it will allow transparency as well as accountability,” said Matthew Charles, who spent 22 years locked in federal prisons on drug charges. Other advocates agreed. Now, as a senior policy adviser with Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Charles pushed the legislation that could have helped when he was incarcerated. BOP allows problems to be covered up, he said, and “never really checks itself.”Coverups will be more difficult under the legislation. The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) will conduct comprehensive, periodic inspections of all correctional facilities. Those inspections will include inmate confinement conditions and staff working conditions. Other areas covered are prison deaths, use of lockdowns, solitary confinement, access to legal assistance, health care, and allegations of threats, abuse and violence against inmates and employees.The inspector general’s office will assign each institution a risk score, with higher risk facilities being inspected more often, and report its findings to Congress and the public. BOP must respond with a corrective action plan within 60 days.Colette S. Peters, who became BOP director in August 2022, welcomes the tougher scrutiny, but with a caveat.“I think the oversight act really enhances the work that we’ve been engaged in over the last two years,” she said in a video call. “One of my concerns is that we’re going to have this additional oversight without the resources to respond in an effective and efficient way. And I don’t want to be left flat-footed, not being able to respond to [the inspector general’s] additional oversight.”Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz already is familiar with the many prison problems. His inspectors documented them in report after report. In 2023, they issued more than a dozen reports with recommendations for prison improvements.“I applaud Congress for passing the ‘Federal Prison Oversight Act,’ and for the overwhelming bipartisan show of support to improve oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP),” Horowitz said in a statement. “Last year, the OIG launched an unannounced inspection program of BOP facilities. The inspections we conducted have identified critical shortcomings in BOP operations, including staff shortages in health and education programs, infrastructure in desperate need of repair, and moldy and rotten food being served to inmates.”Another form of transparency will be a BOP ombudsman to take complaints from employees, inmates and others, “regarding issues that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of incarcerated people or staff,” according to the bill. The ombudsman must “provide multiple internal ways for incarcerated individuals in covered facilities to privately submit to the Ombudsman complaints and inquiries.” Online forms and a telephone hotline will be provided for complaints from prisoner advocates and family members. The ombudsman would not investigate topics related to the conviction of incarcerated people.“I think this is the most significant prison reform legislation passed by Congress in many years,” Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) said during an interview. He is the lead sponsor of the Senate legislation and organized four Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearings on issues affecting federal prisoners in 2022.“One investigation, which found that in two-thirds of federal prisons that house female inmates, inmates had been sexually abused by members of the staff,” he continued. “Another investigation focused on the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta, which found that for nearly a decade, virtually unchecked, corruption and abuse had been ongoing at the facility. BOP headquarters had been warned repeatedly of it and failed to take action. … The Federal Bureau of Prisons over time has become a diseased bureaucracy, with crumbling infrastructure. And, nationwide, incarcerated people are among the most abused, neglected and voiceless populations in the country.”Ossoff worked methodically to secure bipartisan support long before the final vote.“Investigations into our Federal prisons produced shocking and alarming findings,” Republican co-sponsor Sen. Shelley Moore Capito’s (W.Va.) said in a statement. “I was incredibly upset to read reports of misconduct by some prison officials, see the conditions of some facilities, and hear stories about the abuse of inmates.”Their legislation is designed to expose those problems, not fund the solutions. It could, however, provide the congressional groundwork and data necessary to increase funding for badly needed staffing and improved infrastructure.Brandy Moore-White, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals, welcomed “more transparency to the working conditions of our staff,” but the union leader also has a caveat. “While this bill requires reporting about our staffing, it does not fix the core issue,” she said. “Staffing is the root of almost every issue we are facing.”But more people and better buildings alone won’t solve an agency culture so rotten that a warden and a chaplain at BOP’s Dublin, Calif., prison were imprisoned after sexually abusing prisoners.“I don’t presume that this legislation will single-handedly or instantaneously transform a broken federal prison system into one that is perfectly safe and perfectly functioning,” Ossoff said. “But it is, a very important and historic step forward.”"
WaPo_87,How a software error melted down the world’s computer systems,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/bosd-outage-microsoft-crowdstrike/,2024-07-19 22:42:02.891507,,"Widespread technology errors Thursday and Friday stranded airline passengers around the world, halted hospital surgeries and crippled office workers’ computers in one of the most disruptive computer outages in years, highlighting how much of the world relies on essential but inherently error-prone software from a handful of companies.Technology experts said the meltdowns stemmed at least partly from a software error at CrowdStrike, whose technology is widely used by businesses around the world to protect their computer systems from cyberattacks.Microsoft, which powers the computers and technology backbones for many companies, also reported outages with some of its popular web-connected software for corporate and government technology networks.CrowdStrike said in a statement that it had identified and issued a fix for a “defect” in its updated technology for Windows-based software, which is the foundation not only for hundreds of millions of personal PCs but also for many back-end computers that power airlines, digital payment systems, emergency services call centers and much more.The problem wasn’t a cyberattack or a security incident, CrowdStrike said.Marie Vasek, an assistant professor at University College London’s computer science department, said the widespread computer meltdowns showed how reliant technology systems are on a small number of companies’ software, including that of Microsoft and CrowdStrike.“The issue here is that Microsoft is a standard bit of software that everybody uses, and the bug in CrowdStrike is deployed to every single system,” she said.Vasek said technology networks are becoming more sprawling and complex, typically running on software from multiple companies. She said that increases the odds that one botched line of software code at one of those companies could bring down entire computer networks.She and another computer security expert also said that because CrowdStrike’s digital protections are considered so essential, its technology is given priority access on many computer systems. If something goes wrong with CrowdStrike software, that privileged access can grind computers to a halt.It’s ironic that CrowdStrike, whose software is intended to protect from catastrophic computer failures, was responsible for Friday’s widespread computer meltdowns, experts said.Vasek said both Microsoft and CrowdStrike deserve blame for a single software bug apparently causing so many disruptions to people and businesses.She said CrowdStrike needed to consider how to safely update its software to many millions of computer networks. And Microsoft, she said, needed to do more to ensure that updates to software from other companies don’t cripple Windows machines. “Microsoft needs to think about how to check that software is as it should be,” she said.Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.In a statement and in an NBC News’s “Today” Show interview with CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, the company said it is “actively working with customers” to resolve the problems and that many CrowdStrike systems are recovering and will be functional soon.A spokesperson for FS-ISAC, an information technology organization that works with large financial institutions, said many of its customers are implementing the software fix from CrowdStrike. The spokesperson said that essential functions, including banking and payment processing, “are largely functioning with some scattered effects.”It wasn’t immediately clear how many of Friday’s computer network collapses resulted from the defective CrowdStrike software update and which were the result of problems that started Thursday with Microsoft’s online services and cloud computing service Azure — or if the two issues were related.In his “Today” Show interview, Kurtz said that CrowdStrike is “deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this.”This is a breaking news story and will be updated."
WaPo_88,"Dozens killed, internet disrupted in Bangladesh anti-government protests",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/bangladesh-demonstrations-police-hasina/,2024-07-19 22:12:02.891507,,"NEW DELHI — Clashes between police and various student groups in Bangladesh have killed dozens of people after protests escalated sharply over a policy backed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to reserve a portion of government jobs for descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters.In the capital, Dhaka, protesters attacked the state television headquarters and set fire to police booths Thursday as they called for a “complete shutdown” of the country. Running street battles between security forces using rubber bullets and tear gas and crudely armed protesters forced life in several neighborhoods to a halt, with streets emptying of traffic and even the cabinet canceling its meetings, Bangladeshi media reported.More than 150 students were being treated at a Dhaka hospital for injuries after being hit by rubber bullets, Agence France-Presse reported. There were also reports of clashes between protesters agitating against the job quotas and the student wing of Hasina’s ruling party, the Awami League.Schools and universities have been closed indefinitely, and authorities have cut mobile internet services nationwide, citing the need to curb disinformation. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, said live network data showed the country plunged into a near-total internet shutdown late Thursday. The websites for several leading Bangladeshi newspapers were either not updated since Thursday or altogether inaccessible. Television channel have also been taken off the air.As of late Thursday, before communications were fully severed, news outlets reported conflicting numbers of casualties, although most put the number of dead in the dozens. The leading newspaper, Prothom Alo, reported 29 killed and 1,500 injured Thursday, while AFP put the day’s death toll at 32, citing a police spokesman.The protests, which have simmered for weeks but ratcheted sharply in recent days, represent the most serious challenge to Hasina, 76, and her Awami League in years. Hasina’s father, Mujibur Rahman, helped form the Awami League in 1949, which led the country’s bloody independence struggle against Pakistan in 1971. Hasina has argued that families who participated in the liberation war should be compensated with jobs, but her critics say the scheme unfairly benefits families close to the Awami League at a time of economic distress.Although Hasina has been credited with boosting Bangladesh’s textile export industry and improving public infrastructure over her more than two decades in power, the country has recently been wracked by inflation topping 9 percent and stagnant growth. Government positions are often seen as the most secure and coveted option by young jobseekers, but more than half of the slots are reserved for various groups, including residents in remote areas and women.The 30 percent quota for the descendants of freedom fighters existed until 2018, when it was canceled by the Hasina government amid violent protests. Last month, a Bangladeshi court reinstated the policy, and Hasina continued to argue in its favor.At a news conference Sunday, Hasina said she was open to lowering the quota but argued that some form of the policy should exist. She used a politically charged term — “razakar,” referring to the violent mobs that collaborated with the Pakistani army in 1971 — in a comment that reverberated around the country and led to student groups hitting the streets in anger.“Why do they have so much resentment toward the freedom fighters?” Hasina asked. “If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don’t get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of razakars get them?”Hasina has won every election since 2009, including several that have been criticized as unfair, and has come under criticism for her increasingly heavy-handed leadership style. In the run-up to the most recent election in January, her government jailed thousands of opposition figures and won unopposed after rival parties boycotted the polls.The Supreme Court has temporarily suspended the quota policy and said it would make a ruling on its legality on Aug. 7. During her last public appearance Wednesday, Hasina pleaded for “patience” and said she believed “our students will get justice from the court.”"
WaPo_89,Tiger Woods sees the bright side despite missing cut at British Open,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/tiger-woods-british-open/,2024-07-19 23:53:02.936129,,"TROON, Scotland — Near the end of his brief remarks Friday as he began to exit this 152nd British Open, Tiger Woods ran across a case of cross-accent confusion.“Will we see you at Portrush?” went the question, referring to the Northern Ireland site of the 2025 British Open.“What’s that?” Woods said.“Will we see you at Portrush?”“At, where?”“Portrush, will we see you at Portrush next year?”“Portrush. Is that the … next year’s Open? Oh, yeah. Definitely.”He laughed then, and said, “Sorry. It’s a year away. No, I’m sorry.”That burst of merriment helped conclude his major season at age 48 in this final major of 2024, his curtain dropping with a hopeless 77 on Friday in the brooding clouds and the winds off the Firth of Clyde. That, in turn, helped wreak a 14-over-par score that left him ahead of only four other non-withdrawing golfers and nine shots off the projected cut. The four majors he entered, among his five tournament entries overall, saw him miss three cuts, a fate he avoided across all his first 37 majors as a pro, but has befallen him in half the 14 majors he has graced since winning the 2019 Masters.On the upside, the side he always spots, the 15-time major winner, 82-time PGA Tour winner and crowd magnet did enter all the majors played for the first time since 2020. After his harrowing early-morning car crash in February 2021 and subsequent surgeries, he had traveled to zero majors in 2021, three in 2022 and one in 2023, withdrawing from the 2022 PGA Championship and 2023 Masters.“I’d like to have played more,” he said, “but I just wanted to be sure that I was able to play the majors championships this year. I got a lot of time off to get better, which has been the case all year. I’ve gotten better even though my results really haven’t shown it. But physically I’ve gotten better, which is great, so, just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into the competitive flow again.”He made off for the rest of the year, including the father-son event of December, which he winked over as “our fifth major.”He had come here as Colin Montgomerie, the eight-time winner of the European Tour Order of Merit who never could quite claim a major, told the Times of London that he wished Woods would retire so that these noncompetitive years of Woods don’t blur all the bygone dominance. “Well,” Woods said Tuesday, “as a past champion, I’m exempt until I’m 60. Colin’s not. He’s not a past champion, so he’s not exempt. So he doesn’t get the opportunity to make that decision. I do.”Once out on the Royal Troon course with its winds barreling in from surprising directions, Woods floundered worse than in the other majors this year. He had made the cut at the Masters with a very good 72-73 opening but had gone to 82-77 to finish 60th, then had missed the cut by eight shots at the PGA Championship in Louisville (at 7 over par) and by two shots at the U.S. Open in North Carolina (at 5 over par). Here, he said, “Well, it wasn’t very good,” and he smiled there. “Made a double [bogey] there at 2 right off the hop when I needed it to go the other way, just was fighting it pretty much all day. Never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently I made a lot of bogeys.He made five, plus that one double bogey when he spent No. 2 visiting a native area (way left off the tee), some rough and some fringe.“I loved it,” he said yet. “I’ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically” — and he very briefly searched for a word — “sharp coming into the majors. Obviously it tests you mentally, physically and emotionally, and I just wasn’t as sharp as I needed to be and I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did.”“I mean, he’s only playing major championships,” Xander Schauffele said on Thursday after playing alongside Woods as well as Patrick Cantlay. “He’s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he’s hard on himself, too. It’s just hard. I think he’s just learning. He’s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can’t do. I’m sure he’d like to prep more at home if it body would allow it.”That’s where Woods will try to aim toward 2025, and then apparently all the way to Portrush."

Practically every metric used to assess heat ranks among the most extreme in records that date to the late 1800s.Through Thursday, the city’s average temperature stood at 81.9 degrees (an average of highs and lows), 0.7 degrees higher than 2010, the next-hottest summer to date. Last year at this time, the city’s average temperature was a noticeably tamer 77 degrees.So far, the District has racked up 29 days at or above 90, 10 more than normal. And while temperatures have cooled since the historic heat wave early this week (it only hit 89 on Thursday!), long-range forecasts suggest more intense heat is likely.Scorching afternoon highsFor the first time on record, the District reached at least 101 degrees on four straight days between Sunday and Wednesday. Three calendar-day record highs were set in this stretch, adding to the three others this year set on July 22 (100), May 2 (91) and Jan. 26 (80).Tuesday’s record high of 104 was the highest since July 7, 2012.While the summer got off to a somewhat timid start with fewer than normal 90-degree days through mid-June, hot weather has been in near total control ever since. The current tally of 29 90-degree days is only 11 days from the annual norm of 40.An assessment of various extreme temperature benchmarks to date shows this year near the top every list:Sultry nightsIn ways, the abnormally warm nights have been even more impressive than the daytime highs.The low temperature has been 80 degrees or higher on seven nights, which is tied for the most in any year on record — with weeks of summer remaining.The District has posted six record warm lows since May, including four during July so far.The escalation in the frequency of warm, humid nights is a symptom of human-caused climate change, driven by both urbanization and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.Taking the highs and lows togetherTaking an average of the high and low temperatures so far this summer to compute an average, it becomes clear how exceptional this summer’s heat has been.There have been 11 days with an average daily temperature of at least 88 degrees, more than in any full year on record.The 11 days include the five when the highs reached at least 100 degrees and the seven with lows at or above 80.Through Saturday, the D.C. area should continue its pause from extreme heat, with high temperatures below 90 degrees. But predicted highs are forecast to be near or above 90 from Sunday onward.By the end of July and into August, it’s possible that another round of rather intense heat returns.If you dislike heat, some good news is that D.C.’s normal high drops from 90 to 89 on July 28. That said, historically intense heat waves remain possible through a good part of August. In 2016, for example, there were three days at or above 100 in the middle of the month.The National Weather Service’s August temperature outlook — released Thursday — projects a high likelihood of above-average temperatures.Jason Samenow contributed to this report."

On Reddit, IT workers discussed the dizzying scope of the outage.“This is what Y2K wishes it was,” one user commented. Others said the outage was the worst they’ve seen and noted the multiple steps they’re taking to get their employers back online.Microsoft and CrowdStrike blamed the outage on a CrowdStrike software update that went out Friday. In a post on X, Microsoft suggested that affected users fix their computers by restoring the system to a point before the buggy CrowdStrike update went out. It linked to online directions for a manual restore.“Blue screen of death” is a cheeky nickname for a Windows error message that can keep users stuck rebooting their computers. The message reads “Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart. We’re just collecting some error info, and then we’ll restart for you.”Most of the work of getting systems working again will fall to IT professionals working for organizations. But people at home can attempt to work around the blue screen of death as well.Your best bet right now is to restore your computer to a version before the update. To do so, power on your PC, but before it can launch, press and hold the power button to turn it back off. Do this three times in a row, and after the third time, you should see some advanced settings appear. Go to “advanced options,” then “system restore.”You’ll see options for different restart points. Choose a point before the blue screen appeared — perhaps from yesterday. Then click through to the end by choosing “next” or “finish.”Stories to keep you informed

WaPo_93,Investing in women’s sports isn’t ‘charity-pity.’ There’s money to be made.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/womens-sports-investment-wnba-nwsl/,2024-07-19 23:36:02.936129,,"Certain shortsighted business mistakes live on in jeering lore: Blockbuster rejecting Netflix comes to mind, as does Twentieth Century Fox giving up sequel rights to Star Wars. Right about now, as the WNBA counts its ratings and revenue, certain oafish sports owners occupy the same category. Let’s pick on James Dolan, as he’s demonstrative of a particular butt-headedness. This is the guy who so undersold the New York Liberty that he made them work in an arena that hosted cat shows. It now looks as if Dolan lost about $120 million when he sold the team. Who knew karma could smell so strongly of a litterbox.For years Dolan and other owners treated the WNBA as a misdirected little exertion that came at their personal expense. They whined interminably about having to contribute to its marketing and sabotaged it with sneers — and now they’re patting their pockets, while the league’s All-Star Game is one of the most compelling events of an Olympic summer. Dolan sold the Liberty in 2019 to Joe and Clara Tsai of the Brooklyn Nets for a reported $10 to $14 million. The Liberty is now valued at $130 million. In May, the team set a record for revenue from a single game with over $2 million when Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever came to town.Nobody has called out this blinded fiscal bungling with more glee than Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder, entrepreneur and husband of Serena Williams, who is making a mint off the fact that so many legacy male sports owners chose the condition of stupidity. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again — the legacy of the underinvestment of women’s sports isn’t just blatant sexism (which it is), it’s also a lesson in gross business incompetence,” Ohanian posted on social media in 2023.When Ohanian became the co-founder and principal investor in Angel City in 2020, all kinds of people told him he would take a bath. “I just wonder where those people are now,” Ohanian said triumphantly on the red carpet of the ESPY’s last week, where word had leaked out of an imminent deal for Willow Bay and Bob Iger to purchase a controlling stake in Angel City at a $250 million valuation. The club has been generating about $30 million a year in revenue, highest in the nascent National Women’s Soccer League.“Fun-fact: when launching the team, I invested $250K separately in a trust for all of Serena and my children, which has now made our girls not just the youngest owners in pro sports — but also now multimillionaires,” Ohanian brag-posted on X. “They’re proudly holding their shares.”When Ohanian first looked around for an investment opportunity in women’s sports back in 2019, he had the same conversations over and over with the same type of guys: they had stakes in the WNBA or women’s soccer only because they had daughters who liked sports, and wanted to sell. They treated them like “charity-pity,” Ohanian says. They put zero marketing or energy into them as businesses. “Like, why are you surprised it’s doing poorly?” Ohanian wanted to know. They’d swear it wasn’t their languor or dismissiveness; people simply didn’t want to watch women.“They had created an almost kind of Stockholm syndrome of mediocrity,” Ohanian related in a video posted on Instagram. “… Like it was a haplessness and a helplessness that then got offensive, because I realized, this has been compounding for decades … And that is the part that this new generation of owners have exposed.”Ohanian saw what was there to be observed, by anyone with eyes that weren’t squinted by cretinization: an undervalued stock. If women’s games at big events like March Madness, the World Cup and the Olympics could command huge numbers, that meant with some real marketing those audiences could become habitual. The only reason they hadn’t so far, in Ohanian’s view, was because they were “under-resourced, under-marketed, undervalued, underappreciated, undersupported.” All of which was catnip to an investor who likes to be early.What a contrast with Dolan, who in 2018 moved the Liberty, who averaged almost 10,000 at Madison Square Garden, to a 2,300-seat arena in Westchester and then sold them as a failure. Now he’s crying because another thing he totally missed was the streaming revolution and viewer cord cutting. Last week Dolan raged at the NBA because its new media rights deal doesn’t protect his MSG regional sports network — as if Adam Silver can stop consumers from canceling a cable channel run by a guy who inherited his old man’s one good idea.The NBA has subsidized the WNBA from the outset — and as a whole the league hasn’t reached profitability yet. But commissioner David Stern saw the league not as a revenue tool but an investment in global audience growth strategy — and that has worked. The WNBA is set to bring in $2.2 billion in a new media rights deal.It’s hard to believe, but five of the original eight teams in the WNBA are now defunct, shut down by owners who were similarly unwilling to fund or market, or wait. When Stern preached it was a longer-term investment, they didn’t listen. As one league source told me a few years ago, they simply saw “no upside” in it. Their attitude in and of itself was the profit killer.Here’s what they left on the table: The consulting-audit firm Deloitte predicts that by the end of 2024, revenue generated by elite women’s sports will surpass $1 billion for the first time. That’s a 300 percent increase over its last prediction in 2021. As Ohanian has observed, “The market is speaking loud and clear, and folks catch up real quick when dollars are involved.” The market is not just speaking — it’s roaring. And laughing."

The court said member states should not recognize as legal the situation arising from Israel’s unlawful presence in occupied territory, nor should they render aid or assistance in maintaining it.Israel declined to take part in the hearings and described the proceedings as biased and an “abuse of international law and the judicial process.”“The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X after the announcement. “No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.”The ruling marked the first time any international court has weighed in on the core issues related to the legality of Israel’s occupation of the territory it seized during the 1967 war with neighboring Arab countries.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.The case was initiated by a December 2022 U.N. General Assembly resolution, but has since taken on added weight as the decades-long conflict has shifted into a period of unprecedented bloodshed. The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 people in Israel, and the ensuing conflict in Gaza has become one of the century’s most destructive wars, so far claiming more than 38,000 Palestinian lives, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.It is the latest ratcheting-up of international legal pressure against Israel. South Africa has lodged a separate case at the ICJ arguing that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, accusations Israel has vehemently denied. The prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, an intergovernmental organization also in The Hague, is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.Philippe Sands, a member of the Palestinian legal team, described Friday’s opinion as “hugely significant” and possibly even more so in the long term than the genocide case, as it addresses the “core of Israel’s policy.”“Whatever Israel’s reaction, far-reaching legal determination will have significant political consequences, in heaping pressure on Israel and speeding up the process of recognition of the State of six by ever more countries,” he said.The court was asked to determine the impact of Israel’s occupation, the consequences of its “ongoing violation” of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and its “discriminatory laws” and measures aimed at altering “the demographic composition, character and status” of Jerusalem.The questions the court was asked to explore “represent a clear distortion of history,” Israel said in a statement submitted to the ICJ last year.“In pointing a finger at one side only, the questions overlook thousands of dead and wounded Israelis who have fallen victim to murderous Palestinian acts of hatred and terrorism — acts that continue to endanger Israel’s civilians and national security on a daily basis,” the Israeli statement said. “The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not a cartoon narrative of villain and victim in which there are no Israeli rights and no Palestinian obligations.”The ICJ said Israel was responsible for restitution of property lost by “all natural or legal persons concerned,” or in cases where that is not possible, should pay compensation. It accused Israel of a “systematic failure” in preventing or punishing attacks by settlers in the West Bank, creating a “coercive environment” for Palestinians that is inconsistent with Israel’s responsibilities as an occupying power.It said Israel’s policies and practices “entrench” its control of illegally occupied territory, creating “irreversible effects on the ground” that essentially amount to the annexation of “large parts” of Palestinian territory.Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during a swift and resounding defeat of Arab armies led by Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Much international diplomacy on the conflict envisages a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders — a stated goal of the Biden administration — but Israel has steadily expanded its settlements, drastically altering the territory.Between November 2022 and October 2023, Israel “advanced or approved” 24,300 new housing units on occupied territory, Salam said. That included 9,670 in East Jerusalem.Israel claims sovereignty over the entirety of Jerusalem, describing it as its “eternal” and “undivided capital.”Israeli troops and settlers withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but retained control of its borders and ports, and the United Nations still considers the enclave occupied territory.In the West Bank, Palestinians have been squeezed into ever-shrinking islands of land. Presenting the Palestinian case to the ICJ this year, Riad Malki, the Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister at the time, accused Israel of “colonialism and apartheid.” He held up maps to show the drastic erosion of Palestinian territory.During the court’s hearings this year, 52 countries presented opinions, with most urging the court to declare Israel’s occupation illegal. Richard Visek, the legal representative of the United States, described the court’s task as “serious and difficult.” He said any opinion should reinforce the prospect of a two-state solution and warned against a call for a “unilateral, immediate and unconditional withdrawal that does not account for Israel’s legitimate security needs.”The ICJ was established after World War II to settle disputes between countries. The court is composed of 15 judges elected for nine-year terms by the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council."

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Vasek said technology networks are becoming more sprawling and complex, typically running on software from multiple companies. She said that increases the odds that one botched line of software code at one of those companies could bring down entire computer networks.She and another computer security expert also said that because CrowdStrike’s digital protections are considered so essential, its technology is given priority access on many computer systems. If something goes wrong with CrowdStrike software, that privileged access can grind computers to a halt.It’s ironic that CrowdStrike, whose software is intended to protect from catastrophic computer failures, was responsible for Friday’s widespread computer meltdowns, experts said.Vasek said both Microsoft and CrowdStrike deserve blame for a single software bug apparently causing so many disruptions to people and businesses.She said CrowdStrike needed to consider how to safely update its software to many millions of computer networks. And Microsoft, she said, needed to do more to ensure that updates to software from other companies don’t cripple Windows machines. “Microsoft needs to think about how to check that software is as it should be,” she said.Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.In a statement and in an NBC News’s “Today” Show interview with CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, the company said it is “actively working with customers” to resolve the problems and that many CrowdStrike systems are recovering and will be functional soon.A spokesperson for FS-ISAC, an information technology organization that works with large financial institutions, said many of its customers are implementing the software fix from CrowdStrike. The spokesperson said that essential functions, including banking and payment processing, “are largely functioning with some scattered effects.”It wasn’t immediately clear how many of Friday’s computer network collapses resulted from the defective CrowdStrike software update and which were the result of problems that started Thursday with Microsoft’s online services and cloud computing service Azure — or if the two issues were related.In his “Today” Show interview, Kurtz said that CrowdStrike is “deeply sorry for the impact that we’ve caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this.”This is a breaking news story and will be updated."

Never before have I seen those core principles more under threat.On the left, the refusal by some to clearly stand up to radicals such as antisemitic and pro-Hamas protesters, advocates of defunding the police, and the open-borders movement has done substantial damage. However, on the right, there is no clearer example of the threat to American values than Project 2025.This 900-page proposal from the Heritage Foundation was published last year — with the input of many former Trump administration officials and those with close ties to the former president — to serve as a blueprint for a future administration. To call many of these ideas “radical” is a disservice. In truth, Project 2025 takes many of the principles that have made this nation great and shreds them.Toxic politics on both sides of the aisle are undermining faith in our system of government. But Project 2025 sends this disturbing trend into overdrive, casting aside the checks on presidential power that have protected our democracy for more than 200 years.One of Project 2025’s primary targets is federal workers, including about 150,000 Marylanders. Project 2025 proposes to eliminate civil service protections for most of these workers, instead creating more political appointees chosen by the president. The goal is to remove nonpartisan civil servants, most of whom patriotically do their jobs without fanfare or political agendas, and replace them with loyalists to the president.Republicans who believe this power grab will benefit them in the short term will ultimately regret empowering a Democratic president with this level of control.Perhaps more troubling, Project 2025 would undermine the Justice Department by weakening its independence from the president, eliminating the norm that the White House does not intervene in federal investigations. My father was an FBI agent who believed deeply that this work should not be infected by politics. It was that approach that gave him credibility when he became the first Republican in Congress to come out in favor of the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon.It’s true that the ideal of impartial justice that my father embodied has not always been realized. But that does not mean it should be abandoned by choice and design.Project 2025 also proposes enacting absurd and dangerous policies that must be rejected, including mass deportations, disbanding the Education Department, potentially abolishing the Federal Reserve, and withdrawing the abortion medication mifepristone from the market.This radical approach is out of touch with the American people. Most Americans — regardless of party affiliation — have more in common than many realize. They want common-sense solutions to address the cost of living, make our communities safer, and secure the border while fixing the broken immigration system. Instead of addressing these problems, Project 2025 opts for total war against the other side, making it impossible to find common ground.I still believe that bipartisan progress is possible in Washington, but not if we keep going down this dangerous path and fail to defend what made this nation great. The extremes feed off each other, and the exhausted majority of Americans are left trapped between the crazy. The way to start to fix the broken system in Washington is to elect leaders who will do things differently, stand up for American values and hold both parties accountable. That is the only real bulwark against extremism."

Nearly 60 large wildfires are already burning across the West, and the combination of hot temperatures and low humidity will allow blazes to run rampant throughout the upcoming weekend.Heat alerts affecting more than 35 million people plaster weather maps, with excessive-heat warnings for interior southern California, southwest Arizona and southern Nevada. That’s where temperatures could soar above 115 degrees.Warnings are also in effect for the inland deserts of Oregon and Washington, where highs could reach 100 to 110 degrees. Triple digits are also possible into portions of northern and western Idaho, including the Columbia River Basin — a popular summertime hiking destination. Even a sliver of northwest Montana is under heat alerts.“Heat will increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, especially those without effective cooling or adequate hydration,” wrote the National Weather Service.The dry heat will affect anyone outdoors and pose a danger of rapid dehydration. Similarly, vegetation will be sapped of moisture, making more fuel for wildfires to gobble up.The hot temperatures and lack of moisture could help ongoing fires expand. A few dry thunderstorms — thunderstorms that spit out lightning strikes but whose rain evaporates before reaching the ground — are expected to spark new fires too, particularly in southern Idaho and northern Nebraska.The excessive heat is courtesy of a heat dome, or a sprawling ridge of high pressure, that brings hot, sinking air. This latest round of heat follows a scorching two-week stretch to open July in which hundreds of records were set from Washington state to Arizona. Las Vegas as well as Redding and Palm Springs in California set all-time highs around 120 degrees.The heat will ramp up Saturday, with triple digit heat spreading over the majority of the West. Then it will peak Monday and Tuesday before gradually easing next week. Numerous calendar day records will probably be tied or broken”SaturdaySundayMondayTemperatures will remain elevated, but fall shy of records, into the midweek period.The West’s fire season has taken off amid the relentless heat, and firefighting resources are already strained.Fifty-nine large wildfires are burning across the West, including 14 in Oregon, 11 in California, 8 in Montana, 7 in New Mexico and 5 each in Utah, Arizona and Washington.On Thursday, the National Interagency Fire Center raised the national preparedness level to a 5 out of 5, signaling a serious drawdown on firefighting personnel and equipment.“Significant wildland fire activity is now occurring in most geographic areas with a high potential for additional large wildland fires to emerge,” the center wrote in an update on Thursday.Only four other years have reached preparedness level 5 this early in the season — 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2021 — according to records going back to 1990.An outbreak of dry lightning this past week further escalated the fire situation out West, coming on the heels of the historic heat wave that left the landscape parched.Oregon saw a flurry of new wildfire ignitions over the last few days, even as several major blazes burned in the state, including the Falls Fire at over 110,000 acres.In California, more than 9,000 lightning strikes ignited 51 fires between July 14 and 16. Several of those have taken hold, including the Trout Fire, which is burning intensely in the Sequoia National Forest in the southern Sierra.“Lightning really has the potential to make an average or busy season into an exceptionally busy season because it can be so widespread in such a short amount of time,” said Stanton Florea, a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center.More dry lighting is in the forecast for the coming days for the Pacific Northwest and California. And several states face above normal fire risk into autumn.“We know this isn’t going to end soon, so we could have 8 to 10 weeks or longer of a high level of fire activity across the U.S.,” Florea said.The heat is especially challenging for firefighters, who face long hours of grueling work outdoors."

The company said at 6 a.m. Friday the problem had been identified and fixed, but by that point the effects had rippled around the world.The effects of the outage were a reminder of how the global economy is dependent on computer systems that are vulnerable to everything from attacks by sophisticated hackers to bungled software updates. But while the problems were widespread, there was an element of randomness at play, too, depending on which companies in any given industry made use of the defective system.Stories to keep you informed

‘Magical’ self-portrait was hidden for decades — until the canvas was flipped
How can I get healthier hair? Here’s what the science says. 
Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.CrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz said he was “deeply sorry” to anyone affected by the global outage during an appearance Friday on NBC’s “Today” show and vowed to “make sure every customer is fully recovered.”Many CrowdStrike systems are recovering and will soon be operational, Kurtz said, but “it could take some time for some systems that won’t automatically recover.”The company’s problems follow a string of computer security incidents and service outages in recent years that have disrupted online services. Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the latest problem shows how brittle parts of the online world have become as companies have chased efficiency while sacrificing resiliency.“This is one of hundreds of companies you’ve never heard of that are essential to the functioning internet,” Schneier said. He compared the situation to a house built in such a way that nailing a picture to the wall puts it at risk of collapsing.CrowdStrike’s software is widely used around the world by businesses seeking to defend themselves from hackers. The problems Friday affected only computers running Microsoft’s Windows operating system, CrowdStrike said, leaving Apple computers and those using Linux unaffected.While Windows is the operating system for hundreds of millions of personal PCs, it also runs on the computers behind the scenes that are vital to the operation of airlines, digital payment systems, emergency services call centers and other organizations.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X that his company was working with CrowdStrike and Windows users “to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”CrowdStrike said in the blog post that the faulty file implicated in the more widespread outages had a timestamp equivalent to 12:09 a.m. Eastern time Friday. An unrelated Microsoft outage Thursday also caused problems.Some of the most visible early effects of the outage were at airlines. Budget U.S. carriers Frontier and Sun Country disclosed in the early hours of Friday that they were experiencing disruptions, and the problems spread to major airlines and affected airlines overseas.By 6:30 p.m. more than 4,400 flights had been canceled worldwide. Of that, more than 2,700 were flights operating into, within or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.com, an online flight-tracking website. More than 40,000 flights were delayed worldwide, with delays affecting more than 10,000 flights originating or ending in the United States.United Airlines said the outage impacted several key systems: those used for checking in customers, calculating aircraft weight and operating call centers.In the United States alone the impacts were similar to what might be expected during a major snowstorm. And even as airlines reported getting operations back up and running Friday morning, problems in the aviation system can take hours to fully resolve as crews and aircraft are left in the wrong cities.John Cox and his wife found themselves spending more than a day at Reagan National Airport as they tried to get a flight home to North Carolina.A technical issue Thursday evening prompted major airlines including Delta to delay service and reroute passengers. Then their 10:17 a.m. Friday flight to Charlotte was pushed to Saturday at noon. “It completely derailed our plans,” Cox said, slumped on a seat by the entrance of the airport.“We’re going to end up spending a lot more money hanging around in D.C. than if we were back at home,” Cox said, before reclining in his seat and sighing. “There should be some compensation for the immense inconvenience that so many people are enduring.”By Friday morning it had become clear that the effects were reaching a large number of industries and affecting government agencies.The effects on medical providers stretched from the United States to Israel, with doctors losing access to electronic medical records and some hospitals postponing elective procedures.Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit that operates one of the largest hospital systems in Massachusetts, said on its website that it was canceling all “non-urgent visits” at its hospitals and clinics Friday. The organization said its emergency departments remained open and were providing care for urgent appointments and procedures.Alison Baulos said her father, Gary Baulos, was scheduled to have heart surgery Friday at Baptist Health Hospital in Paducah, Ky., but got a call at 3:30 a.m. that the procedure was canceled due to the outage.Her father, a 73-year-old former Navy Seabee and AT&T technician, had just been diagnosed with eight blockages and an aneurysm, she said, and had spent Thursday night at a hotel close to the hospital.“The doctor said he can’t be too active, he can’t raise his hands above his head,” Alison Baulos said. She said her father is taking it in stride. His reaction to the cancellation, she said, was, “all right, since we’re already out here I guess we can go to IHOP for breakfast.”Danielle Carzell, a 35-year-old Atlanta resident, was scheduled to have her hip replaced Friday, a procedure she’s eagerly anticipated for months. Born with a genetic condition — her hips are “like mismatched puzzle pieces,” she said — she’s in constant pain and hoped the surgery would relieve it. But after waiting for hours at Emory St. Joseph’s Hospital, she was told the procedure would have to be rescheduled due to the outage.“I have no idea when I’m going to be able to get my surgery now,” she said. “I have a 5-year-old that I just want to play with, and this outage is just ruining everything.”Even in a sector that has suffered debilitating blows this year — notably the hacks of claims processor Change Healthcare and health system Ascension — experts were surprised by the scale of the impacts Friday.“I was stunned to see this kind of ripple effect,” said Chris Cummiskey, a cybersecurity expert and former Department of Homeland Security official. While CrowdStrike is often seen as the gold standard in cyber protection, he said this event may call for reviewing their internal practices.“You don’t want to hit one button and have this kind of worldwide meltdown occur,” Cummiskey said.Television news stations in several countries were knocked off the air. In Australia, the outage left ABC News unable to deliver its usual evening news update. Instead it showed a special report on the disruption at Sydney airports.Some emergency services also reported problems. The Alaska State Troopers reported that, starting at 9 p.m. Thursday local time, 911 call centers statewide were not working correctly. Service was restored around 4 a.m. Friday when dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or partnered with dispatch centers that had not been impacted, according to the Alaska Department of Public Safety.Federal officials scrambled to assess the situation and provide assistance. Anne Neuberger, a security and technology adviser to President Biden, said her day began on a call with the White House situation room at 4 a.m. as the government sought to determine the effects on its own systems and critical parts of the economy.“It highlights both the degree to which our economies, our national security are now digital and interconnected in a fundamental way,” said Neuberger, speaking on a panel at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.A White House official said that Biden himself was briefed on the outage and that the administration was in touch with CrowdStrike and affected entities. The White House will get “sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” the official added.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview on CNBC Friday that he expected airlines, ports and freight companies to be largely back on their feet by Friday. But he said the episode should prompt some soul searching about the vulnerability of the country to even seemingly minor technical problems.“We’re certainly in a new era in terms of these risks,” Buttigieg said. “I think there will be a huge amount of after action assessment, after the dust settles and things get back to normal.”Hannah Ziegler, Jeff Stein, Aaron Gregg, Adela Suliman and Julian Mark contributed to this report."
WaPo_100,The Democratic Party is ... fine with Harris replacing Biden,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/trump-biden-harris-polls/,2024-07-20 00:52:02.914952,,"For those just tuning in, the state of the Democratic presidential nomination is as follows.Long-standing concerns among Democrats about President Biden’s age became panic after last month’s presidential debate. Rank-and-file Democrats have told pollsters for months that they’d rather have someone else at the top of the ticket. Until the debate, though, that was just idle wishing. After the debate, a segment of the party and its allies began agitating for Biden to be replaced.Biden has not publicly indicated interest in doing so. He points to polling showing that he’s still very much within striking distance of victory. Those seeking to oust him point to polling showing that other candidates are, too, and point out that other candidates might be able to prosecute the case against Donald Trump as Election Day nears.The race remains a referendum on Trump as new polling from CBS News, conducted by YouGov, shows. Only about a quarter of those who plan to vote for Biden say that they are doing so because they like him, compared to about two-thirds of Trump voters who like Trump. Half of Biden voters simply oppose Trump — which presumably would mean that their votes would transfer over to another non-Trump Democrat.The challenge for those seeking to dump Biden — or, more practically, get him to withdraw from the race — is that it’s not clear who might replace him who 1) obviously would fare better on Election Day and 2) wouldn’t turn off part of that quarter of his support who really likes him. Countless Democrats are arguing that “another candidate could beat Biden,” but many of them already have a candidate in mind. If Biden does step aside, the mess simply moves into a new realm, with party infighting not about whether Biden should run but who should run in his stead.The cleanest transition, then, would be for Biden to step aside and endorse Vice President Harris. Polling conducted by YouGov for the Economist shows that such a move would meet with his party’s approval — not his party’s exultation, certainly, but neither would Democrats recoil from it.Three-quarters of Democrats say they’d approve of Harris replacing Biden should the president stand down. Just under half say they’d strongly approve.But notice how unsupportive independents are. Republicans are unsupportive, too, but that’s mostly knee-jerk opposition, as we’ll see in a second. The chart above shows the difference between Biden being replaced in the abstract and his being replaced by someone specific. About half of independents told YouGov in the same poll that they thought Biden should definitely or probably step aside. Only 3 in 10 said they’d approve of Harris replacing him.As that poll suggests, that poll doesn’t bring the Democrats any substantial gain in enthusiasm, at least at the moment. YouGov asked respondents to indicate how favorably they viewed Biden, Harris and Trump. Biden and Harris had similar numbers from Democrats, with less than half saying they viewed either Democrat very favorably. Among Republicans, by contrast, more than two-thirds viewed Trump very favorably.Part of Trump’s support is certainly rooted in his nine years as the party’s preferred pick for president and his effectively sidelining critics over that time. (This was very evident at this week’s convention.) The point, though, is that Democrats look at Biden and Harris and respond about the same way.We can see that in YouGov’s question about whether the candidates care about people like them. Half of Democrats said, yes, Biden does a lot, as does Harris. Three-quarters said both candidates cared about people like them at least some. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans said Trump cares about people like them a lot, though his overall numbers weren’t much different from Biden’s.YouGov also asked respondents if they thought Harris was more likely to win than Biden and, if she did, whether she’d be a better or worse president.Among Democrats, about equal numbers said that Harris would be more likely to win, more likely to lose or likely to fare as well in the election as Biden. They were more likely to say, though, that she’d be a better president than that she’d be a worse one.Note the Republican numbers here, to the earlier point. Republicans are really confident she’d fare worse against Trump. And they’re really confident — despite years of falsely insisting that Biden is completely unfit for his position and/or under the control of nefarious outsiders — that Harris would still somehow be a worse chief executive. It is hard to read this as anything other than knee-jerk hostility.It’s those Democrat numbers that matter for the current debate. If Biden were to step aside, the natural replacement would be Harris. If that happened, though, their party is generally uncertain whether it would make a positive difference. Many of those who think she would fare worse probably have their own preferred non-Biden, non-Harris candidate in mind, someone they’re sure could outperform both Biden and Harris. The number of those candidates who end up as the party’s nominee ranges from zero to one, meaning a lot of disappointed, pessimistic Democrats regardless.The YouGov poll’s essential contribution to the discussion is this: There’s no easy answer."
WaPo_101,‘Breaking barriers’: Mamie Johnson softball team headed to regionals,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/mamie-johnson-softball-regionals/,2024-07-20 00:25:02.914952,,"It was the last inning of the 2024 Little League D.C. state championship. Mamie Johnson’s 12-and-under softball team was on the brink of its first championship win and the players could almost taste the victory.Pitcher Devin Barnes struck out the opposing batter to close out a no-hitter in an 11-0 victory. After two consecutive championship losses, Mamie Johnson’s Little League team made history. For the first time, it was a champion.Catcher Alayna Kennedy’s smile beamed like the bright sun that Saturday morning in late June as she slammed the softball down and rejoiced. Kennedy jumped up and down as her teammates rushed the field for a celebratory group hug.Everything the players worked for in the last three years finally paid off as they now head to their biggest competition yet: the regional tournament of the Little League World Series in Bristol, Conn.“We’ve been working hard and powering through,” said Kennedy, 12. “It just feels really great that we’re going to Connecticut because I feel like we deserve this. We earned it.”In many ways, the Little League team is living up to its namesake. In the 1950s, Mamie Johnson made history as just one of three women to ever play professional baseball in the Negro Leagues. She was the first and only woman to ever pitch in the leagues. Johnson opened doors for Black girls to play softball today.“You don’t see many girls of color playing softball, so these girls, just to have a whole team of them is really breaking barriers,” Coach Keith Barnes said.Mamie Johnson Little League’s softball division began play in 2021 with 20 or so girls, some of whom had experience on the diamond and other who did not. The Anacostia-based organization hopes to pave the way for more girls from D.C. to pick up a softball bat and try a sport they may not have considered before. Barnes remembers teaching girls how to put on gloves and catch the ball when they first started. In just three years, the organization has nearly tripled in size with almost 60 girls playing softball. In addition to the 12U team, the organization has six softball teams in five divisions, with players ranging from ages 4 to 16.Tanya Burrwell had a front-row seat of the organization’s growth as her daughter, Noelle O’Brien, started playing for the organization five years ago. She knew a space made for Black girls from Wards 7 and 8 to play softball was important to her 12-year-old daughter. Like Barnes, Burrwell beams with pride when she looks at how far the team has come.“To just see where they started and where they are now and to just recognize their perseverance and their strength and their courage is nothing short of just amazing,” Burrwell said. “As parents, [it] just makes you feel really good to see them develop into the players that they are now.”“It means a lot to actually know that there’s a softball program in our community and being able to play, have fun with my friends and have new opportunities to try out,” O’Brien said.At just 12 years old, these girls serve as role models to younger girls in the area as well, said Kevin Barnes, Keith’s twin brother. He said the younger girls in the T-ball league have become more interested in softball as a result of watching the team of champions.“They [younger girls] look up to the [12U] girls. The girls work with them and practice with them,” Kevin Barnes, 52, said.The team has also received an outpouring of support from the community. In early July, Barnes organized a GoFundMe fundraiser for resources players will need to compete. To his surprise, the fundraiser met its $20,000 goal within 24 hours of its launch. Even Ted Leonsis, CEO of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, pitched in $2,500, the fundraiser’s largest donation.The girls are now looking ahead to the regional tournament, scheduled for Sunday through Friday, when they’ll play teams from Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The defeat and anguish they felt after losing back-to-back state championships are on the forefront of their minds, Keith Barnes said, and the girls are giving it everything they have to avoid that feeling again.Devin Barnes, 12, has two main goals ahead of the tournament: bringing home the big win and perfecting her pitching. “I’m really excited to be able to pitch in the World Series and to hopefully get a win for my team,”  she said.One of the things Sasha Wilson is looking forward to most is meeting other talented softball players across the country. “It’s a privilege and honor to be able to go up and compete against good teams in D.C., as well as other teams in Connecticut,” the 12-year-old left fielder and utility pitcher said.The girls will play in the fourth game of the tournament on Monday at 1 p.m. against the winner of the second game. If they win the regional championship, they’ll make even more history and have a real shot at the Little League World Series championship. The regionals will be broadcast on ESPN Plus."

But as they unloaded their luggage, a man leaving the airport warned them: “Good luck trying to get anywhere.”Inside, Aguilera encountered “outrageously long” security lines and food shortages at the airport cafes and restaurants, which she documented in two videos posted to TikTok. Her flight — initially scheduled to depart at 7 a.m. — was delayed seven hours, giving her barely enough time to make it to the show.Aguilera was among the countless people worldwide who were tangled by a software outage affecting Microsoft Windows users. The problem, caused by a bad update from the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, disrupted airports, hospitals, transportation systems and other businesses, creating a cascade of chaos and inconvenience.“I had never experienced any of the things that happened this morning,” Aguilera said.Stories to keep you informed

Two dead in listeria outbreak linked to deli meat. Here’s what to know.As the ripple effects spread from the massive IT outage, social media was flooded with posts from people grappling with the fallout. Billboard-sized screens in New York City’s ordinarily sleepless Times Square were left dormant.The nation’s hospitals had to contend with inaccessible machinery and medicines, as well as a swell of missed appointments and canceled surgeries. At a Kaiser Permanente hospital in San Jose, nurse Kim Brown noticed something was amiss Thursday night when the computers in her labor and delivery unit abruptly restarted and the screens turned blue. “Everything just went down,” she said.With a central monitoring system disabled, nurses had to go into patient rooms to check each baby’s heartbeat. A security guard was stationed at the entrance of the unit because the digital alarm system wasn’t working. Because the hospital’s systems were mostly restored by midnight, Brown said she and her colleague didn’t realize the scope of the problem. “We thought it was just us,” she said.But the scale of the CrowdStrike outage set in quickly at Providence Health and Services, one of the nation’s largest nonprofit health-care systems. Providence has almost 15,000 servers running primarily on Windows, and although it eventually restored access to most of its clinical applications, it hadn’t been able to update systems that support anesthesia machines as of Friday morning. The Renton, Wash.-based system had to cancel surgeries at its 50-plus hospitals across seven states, said B.J. Moore, Providence’s chief information officer. A Providence spokesperson later said fewer hospitals were impacted than originally thought, and the elective procedures will be rescheduled.One crucial lingering challenge for hospitals: Third-party vendors such as MRI image processors and blood-testing labs may take longer to apply the CrowdStrike fixes. “Patients are still impacted because other companies may not be remediated this quickly,” Moore said. “The blast radius of this impact is big.”Airline travelers, both domestic and international, faced serpentine lines from Philadelphia to Singapore as flight monitors lit up with thousands of delay and cancellation notices. In Baltimore, airport staff served water and cookies to exhausted travelers who had been stuck since the previous night. In Dallas, the outage forced some airport workers to draft boarding passes by hand.Andy Luten, an American expat living in Australia, had just boarded his red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Sydney when a delay notification flashed on his American Airlines app. He and his fellow passengers spent a couple of antsy hours on the tarmac before getting off the plane around 2 a.m.Inside the Los Angeles airport, Luten was struck by the “heaps of people all over, finding whatever free space to get some rest.” He got as far as the airline lounge, sleeping on the floor for a few fitful hours before rebooking his flight for Friday, nearly 23 hours after his original trip.8:12am The crowd continues to grow. Southwest Airlines is not impacted by this outage here at the BWI Airport. Airport staff is now starting to bring out water and cookies for travelers who have been camped out here since last night. @wjz pic.twitter.com/y6sMRAqbivRegan Brown, 23, canceled her trip to Charlotte after an hours-long wait on the tarmac early Friday in Phoenix. Though she made it onto her American Airlines flight shortly before midnight without issue, several 30-minute delays eventually forced her to deplane around 2:30 a.m. She attempted to rebook her flight or switch to another airline but found herself at a loss.“It was frustrating because they didn’t have any information for us about whether or not they would be able to rebook us or get us anywhere,” Brown said.As she left the airport, Brown saw dozens of people sleeping on the floor, while the monitors on the wall glowed with the Windows operating system’s bright “blue screen of death” everywhere she looked.Kiosks at the Delta ticket counter of DFW being restarted after showing the “Blue Screen of Death.”Long lines are backing up as several airlines deal with the #CyberSecurity outages. @wfaa pic.twitter.com/mkwjLx1LkTShreya Chudasam, associate director of data science for a telecom company, said she missed a Friday deadline because her work laptop was unusable from 8 a.m. until well into the afternoon. She had to limit herself to what she could complete on her work phone, texting with her boss and reviewing her team’s work through screenshots shared on Slack.“It was definitely frustrating,” Chudasam said of her workarounds. “If the work phone wasn’t there, I wouldn’t have gotten done half of the things.”Even the Paris Olympics organizing committee found itself waylaid by the outage as it continued preparations for the kickoff of the Games next week. The outage has had a “limited” impact so far, the panel said in a statement Friday, affecting “the delivery of uniforms and accreditations.” Some delegations were experiencing flight delays, it added.The Microsoft / CrowdStrike outage has taken down most airports in India.

WaPo_106,"A gauzy symbol of woundedness, triumph and whatever else it wants to be",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/19/trump-ear-bandage/,2024-07-20 01:28:02.809574,,"If you have to hit the floor while a would-be assassin tries to take your life, you should get to wear whatever kind of bandage you want for as long as you want to wear it with no judgment from anyone else. But I think at this point we can all also acknowledge that Donald Trump’s bandage became something in addition to a medical necessity at the Republican National Convention. It became a dominant symbol — of woundedness, of triumph, of the stories that Trump tells about himself, and the story he needs voters to believe about the country.What was it, physically? According to Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), the former White House physician who said he originally affixed the bandage to Trump’s ear, the bandage was “bulked up a bit because you need a bit of absorbent. You don’t want to be walking around with bloody gauze on his ear.” Ears “bleed like crazy,” Jackson told the New York Times, and his professional solution was what we all spent four days staring at from our televisions: a tidy white rectangle hovering on the former president’s ear.At any rate. People who were shot at get to wear what they want, but the story of the RNC ear bandages got weird when the bandages began appearing on the ears of attendees who had not been wounded in a shooting. I’m trying to think of a way to say this plainer, in case there is any confusion: uninjured supporters of Trump at the Republican National Convention spent the week taping white squares on their ears because, as one supporter told the BBC, she wanted to show Trump “how much we love him.”Her bandage was not clean and tidy, it was rumpled and improvised as if, seeking her own absorbent, she had turned to Kleenex or Kotex. News organizations assembled photo galleries: Another attendee’s pretend bandage seemed to be stuck to his hair, not his ear, and yet another’s looked like it was literally a piece of printer paper Scotch-taped to his head. There is a Spanish phrase, pena ajena, which doesn’t have a direct English translation, but which refers to the idea that someone else has done something so embarrassing that you feel humiliated on their behalf.The aesthetics of the original bandage were interesting, only because they seemed to be at odds with Trump’s usual presentation of strength, power, masculinity. The man is notoriously vain, and one imagines that if you have time, money and the resources of the entire Republican National Committee at your disposal, you could commission a bespoke flesh-colored bandage, maybe something contoured and discreet. On medical Twitter, doctors and nurses puzzled through the mechanics of Trump’s bandage in great detail: it didn’t have to look that way, they assured the rest of us.But instead, for four days running, Trump protected his ear with the most conspicuous dressing imaginable. If the bandage had instead been bedazzled with the Trump logo, even that would have been more expected — the showman has rarely missed a branding opportunity. The plain white gauze, though, was something else. It was distinctly un-Trumplike. It was clunky, it was pedestrian, it was awkward. Above all else, though, it was a reminder.The lasting, horrifying image from the Butler, Pa., rally last Saturday was of Trump, surrounded by Secret Service agents, shouting “fight” with blood smeared across his face.The bandage reminded us of those initial terror-filled moments, and of the way Trump had behaved during them. This man had long been dogged by insinuations of physical cowardice — he was protected from the draft by bone spurs — but now, under a hail of bullets, shedding blood in pursuit of public service, Trump had rehabilitated his origin story with a defiantly pumped fist. You could loathe the man, and still recognize that the optics of his instincts looked badass.I was wounded, the bandage said. Never forget that they tried to wound me.In this way, the bandage was a familiar message. It was, in fact, the message that, over the years has become one of Trump’s most revisited messages: that he has been uniquely and unfairly hurt. Persecuted and prosecuted by any number of nefarious villains: the liberal left, the deep state, the activist judges, lowly poll workers, Dominion voting machines, Barack Obama, Joe Biden.“He chose to endure abuse, slander and persecution,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate, from the convention center podium on Wednesday, as he described Trump’s political journey.“Nobody has endured more than what he’s been through,” said South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R).And so on, continuing with Thursday night’s convention speeches: “They’ve thrown everything at Donald Trump,” said Hulk Hogan, “… and he’s still standing and kicking their butts.”“They’ve tried everything to destroy his legacy, to destroy his family,” said Trump’s son Eric. “… He has been ruthlessly silenced, slandered and attacked by a corrupt administration.” At one point he addressed his father directly: “We know, and America knows, that they’re not just after you, they’re after all of us and you just happen to be standing in their way.”I have been wounded. We have been wounded. Never forget that what they do to me, they are doing to you, but I am the one who will take it.Trump’s bandage was medically necessary, his doctor said. But for the supporters who fashioned their own make-believe Band-Aids, I wonder if there was a different kind of necessity: the understanding that the world can be a scary place and the belief that they had found a man who would take on their grievances and make them his own.When Trump himself took the stage Thursday night, his speech began as more subdued than the ones that had come before it. He had promised it would be unifying, not divisive. In the hours leading up to it, moving excerpts were released. Talking heads on CNN speculated that maybe he was a changed man, transformed, as many are, by near death. And there were, indeed, many moving sections: “I shouldn’t be here,” he told the audience, describing the shooting.But then, slowly, the 1½-hour-long speech went off script and back into familiar territory, which is to say, bizarre and often angry territory. He talked about “crazy Nancy Pelosi.” He talked about immigration, crime, transgender athletes, taxes, the Yankees, Hannibal Lecter, and sweet Moses only knows what else before eventually petering out and greeting his wife, Melania, on the stage for the balloon drop. He talked about “the partisan witch hunt that I’ve been going through for the past eight years.”He had been through something life-altering, but it wasn’t clear how much he had been altered.For Trump, the wounds are always on display.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of South Dakota Gov.

WaPo_107,Bob Newhart was a gentle soul in a town that often crushes them,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/07/19/bob-newhart-death-obituary-how-old-was/,2024-07-20 01:20:02.809574,,"Bob Newhart was too gentle for Hollywood.His breakneck ascendancy in the 1960s violates every unwritten rule about fame, fortune and success. He didn’t test audience’s comfort levels or make bold political statements. He wasn’t loud or flashy or cruel or caustic or callous or cynical or angry or ruthless or power-hungry.He stammered.He wasn’t the everyman, despite what every obituary will claim, because no one is — and because most men are far less gentle.He was a blue-collar, Catholic kid from the Chicago area, with a business degree and two years in the Army, a law school dropout who worked as both an accountant and a copywriter.He made funny cassette tapes, mostly to pass the time. He was interested in showbiz, sure, but barely pursued it. Then, the whirlwind: A Warner Bros. executive heard and liked his tapes and asked him to record them live. So, Newhart climbed onto a nightclub stage — the Tidelands Club in Houston — for the first time and recorded “The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.”It quickly sold more than a million copies, becoming the first stand-up album to reach the top of the Billboard Charts — effectively inventing the modern stand-up special. It also launched one of the most formidable and influential comedic careers in the last century.This wasn’t the American Dream. This was a fairy-tale.Newhart’s stand-up — crisp, clean and observational, which put it at odds with the day’s popular acts like Lenny Bruce and Don Rickles — made him a buttoned-up star, playing college campuses across the country in a suit, as if he’d just strolled over from an accounting firm.With acclaim came road-weariness, so he jumped at the chance to work in television.“I’d been doing stand-up for 12 years, and being on the road while having three kids,” Newhart told me in 2018. “I wanted a home life, and Arthur Price asked if I’d be interested in a situation comedy, and I said yeah. It would give me a normal life.”We don’t live in a world, or a country, that often rewards kindness and gentleness with fame and fortune. But those qualities led the tributes that poured onto social media after Newhart died Thursday at 94.Billy Crystal called him “a gentle wonderful man.” Judd Apatow tweeted he was “the kindest most hilarious man” with a “gentle spirit.” Actor David Pressman tweeted he “was so unbelievably supportive and kind.”A theme emerges.Carol Burnett: “He was as kind and nice as he was funny.”Jason Alexander: He “was as kind as he was funny.”“Every time I met Bob Newhart, he was EXACTLY Bob Newhart: witty, graceful, low-key, and friendly,” wrote film critic Richard Roeper.Newhart would probably be uncomfortable with the lip service. So consider this anecdote, instead: During the rise of the #MeToo movement, my colleague Monica Hesse asked several women which celebrity, if discovered to be a predator, would most disappoint them. One woman said Bob Newhart.After the resulting piece published, Newhart read it and contacted Hesse and her source, telling them he was moved by their confidence, and that he promised not to disappoint them.That gentleness, that generosity of sprit — that almost radical kindness — infused his work.It seeped into the movie that made him a grandfather figure to a younger generation: the forever kindhearted holiday classic “Elf,” which also showcased to millennials a softer side of James Caan.But, first, it underpinned his sitcoms, particularly “The Bob Newhart Show,” which ran from 1972 to 1978. The show wasn’t outwardly progressive or political like some of its peers — “The Mary Tyler Show,” “All in the Family,” “M*A*S*H” — but it didn’t duck reality.This was especially true in its portrayal of the marriage between Newhart’s Dr. Bob Hartley and his wife Emily Hartley, played by Suzanne Pleshette. The show avoided the tired “dumb husband/nagging wife” tropes, but it was never saccharine. Instead, it was realistic and empathetic.The couple slept in the same bed, an unusual sight on television at the time, since it implied a sex life. The couple loved, admired and, most importantly, challenged each other — not out of some simmering hatred milked for laughs but out of a mature, mutual respect.It’s what drew me to the show, despite it going off the air nine years before I was born.It’s what led me in 2018 to write about “The Bob Newhart Show” on the 40th anniversary of its finale.“It was just good, kind, no-nonsense, mid-America comedy, turning things on its ear,” actor Fred Willard told me then. “It didn’t have that New York edge or that San Francisco hipness. His comedy isn’t hard-edge, bang-bang comedy.”Television’s role in American life has changed over the years. Now, the landscape of streaming services are strewn with shows desperately reaching for that coveted descriptor: prestige. This usually means convoluted or disturbing plots, a dollop of shock factor, and exhausting runtimes.But sometimes you just want to turn off your brain and chuckle. To hang out with your on-screen friends. To watch some clever antics while forgetting the stress of the day, of the world. Sometimes you don’t need Academy Award-winning acting on your small screen, or self-righteous subversion in your stand-up.Sometimes you want something warm.Sometimes you want something gentle.Sometimes you want something comforting. Something that, say, feels like a dream.That’s when you want Bob Newhart.Monica Hesse contributed to this report."
WaPo_108,Why is Tyra Banks serving ice cream in D.C.? Here’s the scoop.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/tyra-banks-ice-cream-shop-smize-dream-dc/,2024-07-20 01:19:02.809574,,"For her decades-long career strutting runways and hosting “America’s Next Top Model,” Tyra Banks was all about serving. With her new ice cream pop-up in Woodley Park, she’s taking “serving” a bit more literally.Banks founded Smize & Dream during the pandemic, selling prepackaged pints in Los Angeles before opening a pop-up in Dubai last year. This shop is her first bricks-and-mortar ice cream shop stateside, though the company has plans to expand to Australia and beyond soon, according to her team. The “Smize” part of the name is a nod to the term Banks coined in 2009, meaning “smiling with your eyes,” advice often given to competitors on “Top Model.” And “Dream” refers to a philanthropic offshoot of the venture.Washington is no New York City or Los Angeles when it comes to celebrity openings. Sure, television chef Gordon Ramsay has his fingers on a Wharf seafood joint, and then there was Michael Jordan’s short-lived steakhouse in the Ronald Reagan Building. But unlike the nation’s big entertainment cities, we’re not usually the go-to for stars trying to build an off-brand brand.So why D.C.? For one, it’s the home of Banks’s brother Devin, a 28-year Air Force veteran who works on Capitol Hill. “We’ve been in different parts of the world for decades,” Tyra Banks said in an interview Thursday at a news conference hosted at the pop-up. “So it’s nice to be here with him.”But more notably, it’s the city she has chosen to also launch the “Dream” part of her project: an educational center dedicated to teaching D.C. youths about entrepreneurship in hospitality (more on that later).The former model, also known for her television gigs on “Dancing With the Stars” and “America’s Got Talent,” says she’s “not just slapping her name” on the ice cream business.“I don’t go check in and go, ‘Oh, how’s it going? Let me take a picture,’” Banks says. “It’s the opposite. I’m so in the trenches that I’m not being the face enough, so I’m trying to be the face and work out loud.”The company, she says, is in many ways dedicated to her mother, Carolyn, with whom she recalls grabbing scoops of coffee-flavored Häagen-Dazs every week as a child. Her mom, Banks says, was working two jobs to afford a move from a one-bedroom Los Angeles apartment.The Woodley Park scoop shop, at 2653 Connecticut Ave. NW, will be open seven days a week, from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and until 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Prices are $7.49 to $11.49 for up to three scoops. Here’s what else you need to know before you visit.The company started in Los Angeles in 2021 and has since opened a pop-up “ice cream trunk” (more on that below) in Dubai. But the Woodley Park location is Banks’s first scoop shop with walls, on the lower level of the French-inspired neighborhood cafe Petit Monde. It has quite a different aesthetic from its pastel-walled neighbor: Bright yellow stairs lead down to a black-painted brick room with several iterations of the brand’s heart-and-eye logo. A sign outlines the pop-up’s rules: “no selfies unless you’re smizing,” and “pose in line like TyTy’s watching. Cuz she is.”The company started in Los Angeles in 2021 and has since opened a pop-up “ice cream trunk” (more on that below) in Dubai.

That’s why she created three “flavor zones” to ease your choice.
The first is “comfort,” which includes a classic vanilla and a rich Chocolate GooGoo Cake that has pudding-infused lava cake pieces — flavors that “taste like childhood,” Banks says. The second zone, “curious,” features such flavors as StrawNana Pudding and Purple Cookie Mon-Star. The “crazy” zone — the most experimental flavors — offers nods to the locale. Cap Hill Crunch infuses Cap’n Crunch cereal ice cream with toffee and Cap’n Crunch-encrusted French toast. That Woodley Park Thang is a bright lemon ice cream with shortbread cookies and blueberry jam. The only vegan flavor, Chocolate Cookies and Cream, is made with cashew and coconut milks.
The menu also features a rotating weekly flavor, teased by Banks on Instagram every Tuesday and available in the shop every Wednesday.Banks says she knows the feeling well — you’re standing in an ice cream shop, a wall of flavor options overwhelming your decision-making, as the line, to your eagerness and dismay, inches ever closer to the counter.

Choose among the Cookie Butta, dipped in semisweet chocolate and rolled in crushed Biscoff cookie; Chocolate Fudge Brownie, covered in dark chocolate with sparkly purple sugar; or the weekly rotating truffle.
“When I came up with the idea for this business, I was like, ‘How can I represent what my mom stands for in dreams and working hard to make her dreams the truth?’” Banks says. “And that’s when I came up with the ‘smize surprize.’ So when you’re digging, think about your dream — not weight loss — and where that comes from.”One of the store rules warns customers against asking for toppings — “cuz our flavors can’t be topped.” But each order comes with what Banks has dubbed a “smize surprize,” a truffle hidden at the bottom of the cup or cone.

Outside, you’ll find an “ice cream trunk” — not truck — to point people to the subterranean location. The oversize faux luggage, Banks says, is a nod to her “fashion side.” The trunk may soon open for additional seating, but for now, you can pose in front of its gold-decked exterior. On the side, it says: “Never too old to dream. Never too young to smize.”The pop-up may be in a dimly lit basement, but that doesn’t mean Banks hasn’t included several chances to snap a photo for your grid.

WaPo_109,CrowdStrike outage disrupts travel and business worldwide after faulty update,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/19/windows-outage-crowdstrike-cancellations-computer/,2024-07-20 01:00:02.809574,,"A defective update to an obscure piece of security software knocked out computer systems around the globe Friday, causing widespread disruptions to travel, medical care, government agencies and retailers.Airline passengers were stranded at airports as thousands of flights were canceled. Hospitals closed their doors to patients expecting routine appointments. Shoppers encountered self-checkout terminals showing the notorious Blue Screen of Death that pops up when Windows fails. Even the organizers of the upcoming Paris Olympics reported impacts to the delivery of uniforms.The problem traced to an update issued for Windows computers by security firm CrowdStrike, the company said in a blog post. The company said at 6 a.m. Friday the problem had been identified and fixed, but by that point the effects had rippled around the world.The effects of the outage were a reminder of how the global economy is dependent on computer systems that are vulnerable from everything from attacks by sophisticated hackers to bungled software updates. But while the problems were widespread, there was an element of randomness at play, too, depending on which companies in any given industry made use of the defective system.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.CrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz said he was “deeply sorry” to anyone affected by the global outage during an appearance Friday on NBC’s “Today” show and vowed to “make sure every customer is fully recovered.”Many CrowdStrike systems are recovering and will soon be operational, Kurtz said, but “it could take some time for some systems that won’t automatically recover.”The company’s problems follow a string of computer security incidents and service outages in recent years that have disrupted online services. Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the latest problem shows how brittle parts of the online world have become as companies have chased efficiency while sacrificing resiliency.“This is one of hundreds of companies you’ve never heard of that are essential to the functioning internet,” Schneier said. He compared the situation to a house built in such a way that nailing a picture to the wall puts it at risk of collapsing.CrowdStrike’s software is widely used around the world by businesses seeking to defend themselves from hackers. The problems Friday affected only computers running Microsoft’s Windows operating system, CrowdStrike said, leaving Apple computers and those using Linux unaffected.While Windows is the operating system for hundreds of millions of personal PCs, it also runs on the computers behind the scenes that are vital to the operation of airlines, digital payment systems, emergency services call centers and other organizations.Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X that his company was working with CrowdStrike and Windows users “to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”Some of the most visible early effects of the outage were at airlines. Budget U.S. carriers Frontier and Sun Country disclosed in the early hours of Friday that they were experiencing disruptions, and the problems spread to major airlines and affected airlines overseas.By 9 a.m. Eastern time, more than 2,100 flights had been canceled worldwide. More than 1,200 of those were flights operating into, within or out of the United States, according to FlightAware.com, an online flight-tracking website. More than 22,000 flights were delayed worldwide, with delays affecting more than 2,600 flights originating or ending in the United States.In the United States alone the impacts were similar to what might be expected during a major snowstorm. And even as airlines reported getting operations back up and running Friday morning, problems in the aviation system can take hours to fully resolve as crews and aircraft are left in the wrong cities.John Cox and his wife found themselves spending more than a day at Reagan National Airport as they tried to get a flight home to North Carolina.A technical issue Thursday evening prompted major airlines including Delta to delay service and reroute passengers. Then their 10:17 a.m. Friday flight to Charlotte was pushed to Saturday at noon. “It completely derailed our plans,” Cox said, slumped on a seat by the entrance of the airport.“We’re going to end up spending a lot more money hanging around in D.C. than if we were back at home,” Cox said, before reclining in his seat and sighing. “There should be some compensation for the immense inconvenience that so many people are enduring.”By Friday morning it had become clear that the effects were reaching a large number of industries and affecting government agencies.The effects on medical providers stretched from the United States to Israel, with doctors losing access to electronic medical records and some hospitals postponing elective procedures.Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit that operates one of the largest hospital systems in Massachusetts, said on its website that it was canceling all “non-urgent visits” at its hospitals and clinics Friday. The organization said its emergency departments remained open and were providing care for urgent appointments and procedures.Television news stations in several countries were knocked off the air. In Australia, the outage left ABC News unable to deliver its usual evening news update. Instead it showed a special report on the disruption at Sydney airports.Some emergency services also reported problems. The Alaska State Troopers reported that, starting at 9 p.m. Thursday local time, 911 call centers statewide were not working correctly. Service was restored around 4 a.m. Friday when dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or partnered with dispatch centers that had not been impacted, according to the Alaska Department of Public Safety.Officials in Washington said they were monitoring the situation and providing assistance. A White House official said that President Biden was briefed on the outage and that the administration was in touch with CrowdStrike and affected entities. The White House will get “sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,” the official added.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview on CNBC Friday that he expected airlines, ports and freight companies to be largely back on their feet by Friday. But he said the episode should prompt some soul searching about the vulnerability of the country to even seemingly minor technical problems.“We’re certainly in a new era in terms of these risks,” Buttigieg said. “I think there will be a huge amount of after action assessment, after the dust settles and things get back to normal.”Hannah Ziegler, Jeff Stein, Daniel Gilbert, Aaron Gregg, Adela Suliman and Julian Mark contributed to this report."

That was Friday.It was not quite a global catastrophe, since it was mostly just a lot of devices, gadgets, computers and machines failing to work right. But it was revelatory — and ominous.In today’s world, a single bad piece of software can wreak havoc on a global scale. And there’s more of this to come, according to experts who study and fret about our increasingly complex technological systems.“We have, as this shows, lots of infrastructure relying on single points of failure,” said Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus at New York University and author of the forthcoming book “Taming Silicon Valley,” on Friday. “Absolutely nothing guarantees that we won’t have an other similar incident either accidentally or maliciously.”As more information emerged about the cause of the outage, it seemed clear it was nothing more than an accident, one caused by faulty software in an automated update from an Austin-based company called CrowdStrike. The big headline was the vulnerability of major industries, such as aviation and banking. But it was a rough time for anyone with a computer that on Friday morning announced blandly and without further explanation that it was not working.Consumers of technology expect software to perform, and it usually does. But that invites complacency and digital illiteracy: We don’t remember anyone’s phone number because on a smartphone you just tap the name and the call goes through. We don’t carry cash because everyone takes plastic.Life in the 21st Century is pretty magical — until it’s not.Marcus fears that society will become even more vulnerable as we rely increasingly on artificial intelligence. On X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, he wrote: “The world needs to up its software game massively. We need to invest in improving software reliability and methodology, not rushing out half-baked chatbots. An unregulated AI industry is a recipe for disaster.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.The AI revolution — which did not come up a single time during the June presidential debate between President Biden and former president Donald Trump — is poised to make these systems even more interdependent and opaque, making human society more vulnerable in ways no one can fully predict.Political leaders have been slow to react to these changes in part because few of them understand the technology. Even technologists can’t fully understand the complexities of our globally networked systems.""It’s becoming clear that the nerve center of the world’s IT systems is a giant black box of interconnected software fully intelligible to no one,” Edward Tenner, a scholar of technology and author of the book “Why Things Bite Back,” said in an email Friday.“You could even say that it’s a black box full of undocumented booby traps.”What happened Friday brought to mind a threat that never fully materialized: Y2K. Twenty-five years ago, as we approached the turn of the century, some computer experts feared that a software bug would cause airplanes to fall out of the sky — along with all sorts of other calamities — the moment 1999 turned into 2000. Governments and private industry spent billions of dollars trying to patch up the computer problems in advance, and the big moment arrived with minimal disruption.But the question of how vulnerable — or resilient — the global information networks of 2024 are cannot be easily answered. The systems are too numerous, too interconnected, for anyone to have full battlefield awareness.Friday’s tech outage served as a fleeting reminder of the fragility of that invisible world, especially for those trying to catch planes, book surgeries or power up personal computers that had gone into a mysterious failure mode. Trending online all day was “Blue Screen of Death,” the nickname for the error message that appears when Microsoft Windows ceases operating safely. The Blue Screen of Death, people discovered, has in recent times taken on a gentler, less alarming shade of blue, as if someone had consulted a color theorist.It did not go unnoticed that CrowdStrike, a company that provides software to ward off cyberattacks, was responsible for the outage. Tenner, the author, points out that in the history of disasters, technologies meant to improve safety have often introduced new risks.“Lifeboats and their deck reinforcements installed after the Titanic destabilized a Lake Michigan excursion ship, the SS Eastland, in 1915. Over 840 people died in Chicago harbor when it capsized during loading,” Tenner said.And then there’s the safety pin: It was swallowed, open, by so many children that a surgeon developed a special tool to extract it, Tenner said.Brian Klass, author of “Fluke: Chance, Chaos, and Why Everything We Do Matters,” wrote on X after the tech outage that “we’ve engineered social systems that are extremely prone to catastrophic risk because we have optimised to the limit, with no slack, in hyper-connected systems. A tiny failure is now an enormous one.”Technological disasters can also be triggered by natural causes. Prominent on the minds of many natural security experts is the risk of a powerful solar storm knocking out the electrical grid, or damaging satellites crucial to communication, navigation, weather prediction and military surveillance.Such satellites also could be targeted by a hostile adversary. U.S. officials have expressed concern about the possibility that Russia could be developing the capability to deploy a nuclear weapon in space that would pose a threat to our satellites — and potentially create an exponential increase in space debris with catastrophic consequences.But Friday’s tech outage emerged without any geopolitical machinations, or anything as dramatic as a thermonuclear explosion. It was just the result of some bad code, a bug — a glitch in the system."
WaPo_112,Follower of far-right group who assaulted officer on Jan. 6 sentenced,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/brody-sentenced-jan-6/,2024-07-20 02:56:02.833596,,"A Fairfax County supporter of a white supremacist group was sentenced Friday to 18 months in prison for assaulting a police officer and destroying media equipment at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.Joseph Brody, 24, said in federal court in Washington that he “didn’t intend to harm any innocents.” He said he believed it would have taken “supernatural courage” to “do what is right in the moment” and “go against the crowd.” U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich said that she found his remorse lacking but that she was giving him a relatively light sentence because he had just turned 21 at the time of the attack. “I hope you will reflect on the impact this had,” Friedrich said.Brody was one of several young men who traveled to the Capitol together on Jan. 6 as supporters of Nick Fuentes, an online personality who founded the America First Foundation and whose followers call themselves “Groypers.” Fuentes — who has espoused racist and antisemitic views, denied the Holocaust and endorsed segregation — gained new prominence in 2022 when he dined with Donald Trump and rapper Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Brody was prolific in “America First” chatrooms, where he frequently made sexist, racist and anti-gay comments and fantasized about rape and murder, according to anti-fascist researchers who reviewed leaked chat files.Brody and his friends were among the first rioters to enter the Capitol, about 2:15 p.m. They then went into an office belonging to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Brody separated from them and went onto the Senate floor, where he photographed some documents he thought looked important, according to facts detailed in his plea agreement from February. After leaving the building, he shoved a bike rack into a police officer guarding the north side of the building, who responded by spraying Brody with a fire extinguisher. Brody then joined a group destroying media equipment on the Capitol grounds; he took apart a corded phone and pulled out an extension cord.Friedrich agreed with prosecutors that Brody was “a leader,” someone “taking charge” in the riot rather than just a follower of the crowd. But she called his pushing of the officer “kind of pathetic” and said many assaults were more egregious.Public defender Alexis Gardner described Brody in court as akin to “a young, dumb frat boy,” drunk on mob passion instead of beer.“They have the president behind them,” she said, referring to Trump. “They all feel that they’re on the right side of history.”Gardner argued that incarcerating Brody was counterproductive, given that the “neo-Nazi ideals” he had expressed are widespread in U.S. prisons and could prove persuasive again: “His brain still isn’t fully developed yet.”After Brody’s arrest, Fuentes — who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 but did not go inside — outed his former ally as the commenter “Broseph” on America First internet forums. While Broseph accused some far-right figures of alienating mainstream Republicans, according to chats leaked to the alternative media site Unicorn Riot, he also spoke against immigrants, journalists and Jewish people.“Easy to dehumanize immigrants when you’re forced to be around them,” one 2018 post reads. In another, Broseph wrote, “Journalists have names and addresses. … They should be worried about death squads coming for their lives.” He bragged about having Eastern European roots, saying his people “purged” Jews from the continent, and said he was sympathetic to a mass murderer who targeted young women. He occasionally commented on local Virginia politics; in 2018, he expressed support for state lawmaker Nick Freitas in the Republican primary to take on Sen. Tim Kaine (D).After the Jan. 6 riot, Brody briefly coordinated door-knocking efforts in Fairfax County for Glenn Youngkin (R) in his successful gubernatorial campaign. A spokesman for the Republican Party of Virginia said Brody was an employee for only about a month in 2021; he did not work for the Youngkin campaign.Brody was a football captain at Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Va., which was renamed for late congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis in 2020. After high school, while working various jobs to pay tuition at Northern Virginia Community College, Brody told the court, he “began getting more and more involved in politics … through online discussions and videos.” That content, he said, “led me down a path toward more and more fringe ideas.”He dropped out of school during the coronavirus pandemic, he said in court. In a letter to the judge, he said he then “started to get involved” with the Groyper movement and participated in “unfortunate” events, including the Jan. 6 riot. But, he said, “that was a phase in my life that has passed. For over two years now I have not been associated with those people.”Friedrich did not ask Brody about his engagement with white supremacist ideas; instead, she focused on his dropping out of college and his sporadic employment.“Most 24-year-olds aren’t just sitting at home being taken care of by mom or dad,” the judge said.The sentencing was split over two days several weeks apart, and in the interim Brody launched an outdoor handyman company. But Friedrich said Friday that she was still bothered by his “lack of motivation.” “I can’t help but be concerned by your inability to launch,” she told him.His mother, Maureen Brody, who has run for school board in Fairfax County and for a seat in the state legislature, has said that she was also at the Capitol on Jan. 6. On social media, she has promoted Fuentes’s work and false claims about human trafficking purportedly orchestrated by Democrats. She declined outside court to comment on her views."
WaPo_113,Biden’s appearances since debate have not stopped calls to dropout,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-events-after-debate-videos/,2024-07-20 02:43:02.833596,,"In the three-plus weeks since his halting debate performance, President Biden has ramped up his public appearances to assure Americans, including members of his own party, that he is up to the task of a second term.Biden took to the campaign trail after the debate, holding rallies, sitting for interviews and making campaign stops. He’s made impassioned speeches and shown off policy knowledge, but he has also at times stumbled over words, mixed up names and meandered in speech.With his candidacy on the line as members of his party continue to call for him to step down, each appearance has been a high-stakes moment for Biden. Polls show that most Americans, including a majority of Democrats, would prefer another candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket.Here are six snapshots of Biden’s public appearances over the past three weeks — including times he’s parried concerns about his age successfully and times when his attempts have failed.The day Biden tested positive for covid, he returned to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to isolate. He was experiencing cold symptoms, including a cough and malaise, according to the White House.When he landed at Dover Air Force Base, Biden paused twice on the stairs as he disembarked the plane. He took two steps down before stopping, waving and smiling, then two more before pausing and gesturing again. He then descended the rest of the stairs. Reporters traveling with him noticed that he was moving slowly.During a visit to Nevada the day before, Biden flubbed his announcement of a new proposal to cap rental costs. The proposed policy would cap annual rent increases at 5 percent for tenants of landlords who own more than 50 units. Biden mistakenly announced that the policy would cap rent increases at $55.Biden was forceful in other parts of the speech, and the campaign stop reflected a major push from the White House to respond to voter anger over high housing prices. It was also an effort to reach Nevada voters, who have seen among the biggest jumps in housing costs nationwide and whose electoral votes Democrats have grown increasingly worried they could lose to Trump in November.A few days before his Nevada stop, Biden spoke forcefully at a campaign rally in Detroit on July 12, delivering an energetic vow to stay in the race. “There’s been a lot of speculation lately: ‘What’s Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?’ Well, here’s my answer: I am running, and we’re going to win!” he shouted.He vowed to beat Trump again, insisting that he would stay in the race and making an impassioned case for his candidacy. He also spoke about what he would do in his first 100 days of a second term.“I’m the nominee,” he said to chants of support from the audience. “You the voters, you decided. No one else. And I’m not going anywhere.”Introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at an event during the mid-July NATO summit in Washington, Biden mistakenly called him “President Putin,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden stepped away from the podium, then immediately caught himself. “President Putin! He’s going to beat President Putin. President Zelensky,” he corrected himself.That evening, Biden held a news conference seen as vitally important for rescuing his candidacy. Taking questions from reporters for almost an hour, the president showed his command of a range of topics but mistakenly used some words and names. Most notably, he referred to Vice President Harris as “Vice President Trump.”A little more than a week after the debate, Biden leaned on a familiar tactic: He joked about his age. Speaking at a church service in Philadelphia, he quipped, “I know I only look like I’m 40 years old, but I’ve been around a little bit.”“All kidding aside,” he continued, “I’ve been doing this a long time, and I honest-to-God have never been more optimistic about America’s future — if we stick together.”The church visit was part of a swing through Pennsylvania as Biden worked to drum up support in the key swing state while Democrats privately debated whether he should step aside.Among the many missteps Biden made at the debate was a moment when he appeared to lose his train of thought when responding to a question from CNN moderator Jake Tapper about tax cuts for the very wealthy.Biden suggested that raising taxes on the very wealthy — for whom Trump enacted tax cuts — would help wipe out the national debt incurred by Trump. Biden then began listing ways that additional tax influx could strengthen the health-care system. He appeared to lose his way, however, in describing the last item on his list, making a few false starts before ending with, “look — if — we finally beat Medicare—” He was cut off by the moderator, and the “We finally beat Medicare” line became one of his most notable gaffes of the night, with Trump quickly seizing on it.Toluse Olorunnipa, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Michael Birnbaum, Cleve R.

WaPo_114,‘Hillbilly Elegy’ was almost universally praised. Times have changed.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/19/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-reviews/,2024-07-20 02:36:02.833596,,"The opening of “Hillbilly Elegy,” published in 2016, hits different now: “My name is J.D. Vance, and I think I should start with a confession: I find the existence of the book you hold in your hands somewhat absurd.” Then: “I am not a senator, a governor, or a former cabinet secretary.”Six years later, Vance was elected senator, and last week, Donald Trump selected him as his 2024 running mate, prompting many to revisit the memoir that catapulted Vance into public life — including critics that heaped praise on the book when it was published.In retrospect, many view the book as having been designed as a springboard into a political career. (“J.D. Vance for President?” asked Vogue in 2017.) Yet when Emily Esfahani Smith filed her review to her editor at the Wall Street Journal that summer, she didn’t think of the book as particularly political.“I just thought it was a really compelling story,” she said. Only during the editing process did Smith add a quick reference to how the book had been published “during an election in which much has been promised to white working-class voters.” Her review happened to run the week that Rod Dreher’s interview with the author crashed the website of the American Conservative, and as the book took off, “I had to come to the conclusion that, wow, this book is touching on a nerve.”During the election and its immediate aftermath, critics declared Vance’s personal account of his impoverished childhood in Ohio an urgent sociological text. The memoir was nearly (nearly) universally praised, becoming a staple of university reading programs and critics’ best-of lists. “Hillbilly Elegy” wasn’t just good; it was “essential.”Vance was “a palatable messenger for information that people were sort of starting to figure out that they needed in that time. They needed to understand the Trump base, the Trump voter,” recalled Meghan Daum, who reviewed the memoir for the New York Times.Within a couple of years — before Vance declared his intent to run for office in 2022, and even before Ron Howard’s film adaptation came out in 2020 — the public mood seemed to sour on the book.“At a certain point, everyone just turned on it,” Daum said. “It’s hard to say why, though. People were mad at him because he was sort of doing the ‘up by the bootstraps’ thing. And showing any kind of understanding at all of people from those communities was suddenly so taboo.”The criticism was bipartisan, Smith said. “I think on the right, it was more like, ‘Oh, wait, it’s just too simple and glib to say that J.D.’s book explains Trump. The Trump supporter isn’t just living in Appalachia.’”As the Republican National Convention unfolded this week, some critics noted Vance’s shift away from the beliefs he’d espoused in the book.Slate critic Laura Miller wrote Tuesday: “All the qualities that made ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ one of the best books I read in 2016 — its brutal honesty, its challenges to the self-delusional and self-defeating aspects of hillbilly culture, its mournful ambivalence about the identity he’s only partially left behind — have been shamelessly jettisoned by Vance for the sake of his political career.” She added: “Nowhere in the book does Vance express concerns about immigrants, documented or otherwise, or the perfidy of the deep state.”“He’s a very good writer. I have to say he’s a lot better writer than he is a speaker,” said Financial Times columnist Edward Luce, speaking over the phone the morning after Vance’s acceptance speech.“Probably one of the reasons why ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ hit a chord was because he did in that book the opposite of what he did last night,” Luce said. “In 2016, it was, ‘We are to blame for a lot of our own predicament.’ Last night he was a victim, and they were all victims, of neoliberalism on Wall Street and the larger forces of capitalism and indifference to middle America. That was a complete U-turn from the moral of the story of ‘Hillbilly Elegy.’”Their opinions of the author aside, do the critics think that “Hillbilly Elegy” still had something to say to America in 2024?“It was an inspiring story. I learned a lot about a segment of America that I didn’t know very much about before I read the book. Those things totally still stand,” Smith said.“It’s a good story. I think there’s a lot of people who don’t realize that this stuff goes on. Unfortunately, we’re in a moment that once you start talking about this demographic, people just shut down immediately,” Daum said, later adding, “I mean, this is not Tobias Wolff, okay? But there are a lot worse books.”The vice-presidential nomination appears to have drawn in many new readers: “Hillbilly Elegy” surged to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list following Trump’s announcement Monday. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)But any who wish to wade into the literary debate may have to wait, at least on one platform: Goodreads temporarily blocked anyone from posting new ratings or reviews."
WaPo_115,The main similarity of QAnon and ‘BlueAnon’ is that they rhyme,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/qanon-blue-anon-trump-shooting-conspiracies/,2024-07-20 02:34:02.833596,,"The attempt on Donald Trump’s life last Saturday has spawned a flurry of conspiratorial claims, ranging from the motivations of the shooter to theories on Trump fortuitous escape from serious harm. As The Washington Post’s Taylor Lorenz documented, many of those claims emerged on the left — a pattern jokingly referred to as “BlueAnon” in a nod to the QAnon conspiracy theory that was the subject of broad coverage during Trump’s presidency.There are a few reasons that false or unsupported claims about the assassination attempt have found traction on the left. The most obvious is that Democrats simply don’t trust Donald Trump and his allies to be honest. That’s a function of years of well-documented dishonesties from the former president. Another is that the shooting occurred, as Lorenz notes, as some on the left were already theorizing about purported efforts to undermine President Biden and his candidacy.To someone looking for a conspiracy, it’s easy to find evidence. Oh, the Secret Service just happened to fumble the ball? A shot just happened to wound but not seriously injure the former president? He just happened to react in a way that his supporters could rally around?The answers are easy: the ball was fumbled, the miss was a matter of chance, the celebrated photo of Trump raising his fist is one of a series that also includes Trump looking distinctly alarmed. But “it was staged” is a more compelling way of thinking about it than “mistakes were counteracted by luck.”A recent poll suggested that a fifth of Americans thought it was credible that the incident could have been staged, with a third of Biden supporters — and 1 in 8 Trump supporters — holding that view. Most respondents, of course, said it wasn’t a credible claim.But those numbers provide an opportunity for one of the right’s favorite rhetorical tactics: whataboutism. At last, here was a moment the left was exploring the terrain of politically motivated fantasy. Or, as the conservative Free Beacon put it:“The findings show that large swaths of the Democratic base have fallen prey to the phenomenon known as ‘BlueAnon,’ a play on the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory that once gripped portions of the Republican base and served as an obsession of the mainstream media throughout the first Trump administration,” Andrew Kerr wrote on Thursday. ""[T]he Morning Consult poll shows that BlueAnon adherents among the Democratic base far outnumber their QAnon counterparts on the right.”The appeal of this comparison is obvious. Unfortunately for Kerr, it's also comparing apples with satanic oranges.Kerr’s comparison is rooted in 2021 polling from PRRI that measured belief in core tenets of QAnon. Only 21 percent of Republican respondents agreed with one of those tenets — but the tenet was “the government, media and financial world in the U.S. are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation.” That’s what a fifth of Republicans agreed with. It should be a point of relief that the figure was lower than the percentage of Democrats who said that the idea the shooting was staged is “credible.”A way we might view those PRRI poll numbers as less alarming is to consider that it’s much more common to be willing to claim to adhere to an extreme form of anti-elitism than it is to actually adhere to it. Some of those respondents offered agreement because they liked the idea of indicating how distasteful they found “the government, media and financial world.” Some of the Democrats who said the shooting conspiracy theory was credible likely said that because it expressed that they wouldn’t put such a thing past Trump and his allies.The effort to draw a partisan contrast between QAnon and the shooting conspiracy theorists is hobbled in another significant way: A different conspiratorial perspective on the shooting is rampant on the right.This is most obvious in the repeated pronouncements that “they” shot Trump. This was the reason that wrestler Hulk Hogan gave for agreeing to speak at the Republican convention during a Fox News interview on Friday morning, that “they tried to kill” the former president. The hosts, perhaps failing to even recognize Hogan’s framing as aberrant, didn’t ask him to explain how the sole shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, constituted a “they.”Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) has given several interviews this week in which he not only refers to the attack as originating from a “they,” but also that the ability of the shooter to target Trump “seems intentional.” Not that the attack was staged, in other words, but that it was perhaps allowed to occur.There were other rampant claims made about the shooter on the right, too: that he was antifa, for example (as promoted by One America News’s Chanel Rion) or that he was trans (which originated on the anonymous message board 4chan). The lack of an identified motivation on Crooks’s part — and the possibility that it wasn’t ideological at all — led to various efforts to fit the shooting into preexisting belief systems, even if that fit was clumsy or imprecise.Researcher Kate Starbird of the University of Washington describes the confused aftermath of a major news story as a period of “collective sensemaking.” Our efforts to make these things make sense center on the frames through which we view the world.“Frames help us give meaning to evidence. They shape how we interpret evidence, how we connect different pieces of evidence, and also which evidence we focus on and which evidence we leave out,” Starbird explained in an email to The Post. “Frames basically help us decide what the problem is, what caused it, and what might remedy it” — but they “also have a moral dimension.”“[A]mplifying specific evidence may cause people to select one frame rather than another,” Starbird wrote. “For example, noting the party identification of the suspect might invoke a frame suggesting their motivations were political.”Crooks was a registered Republican, which is one reason the application of the partisan frame has been so fraught.There’s one more salient point when comparing the aftermath of the shooting to QAnon. The former occurred less than a week ago, as of this writing, and was even more recent when the poll was conducted. There remain numerous unresolved questions, meaning that it is easier to shift from “I don’t know” into “therefore, I think.” That’s not the case with QAnon. It wasn’t a response to a lack of information but an embrace of overtly bad information.It’s easy to see why “the Democrats have their own QAnon” is appealing. It fits into a well-established existing frame for people on the right (for example, “they do bad stuff, too”).But the primary parallel between “BlueAnon” and QAnon is that they rhyme. Beyond that, it’s a stretch."
WaPo_116,Trump has a lock on 2024. But the race for 2028 is already underway.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/republicans-trump-2028-jd-vance-republican-convention/,2024-07-20 02:28:02.833596,,"MILWAUKEE — Prayer breakfasts. Prime-time television speeches. Meetings with early state delegations. Panels with grass-roots groups.Delegates, lawmakers and party officials at this week’s Republican National Convention were all in for Donald Trump and his 2024 campaign for the White House. But that doesn’t mean they weren’t already looking ahead to 2028. Over four days in Milwaukee, some state delegates took a break from celebrating Trump to think about whom they might support in a future presidential election.Call it the shadow campaign for the post-Trump era, with many of the GOP’s biggest names — whose stars have been somewhat dimmed by Trump’s all-encompassing aura in recent years — trying to make their mark with the party faithful as early as they can. The positioning among next-generation leaders happened both publicly on the convention floor and behind the scenes as Trump’s vice-presidential pick — Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), 39 — sparked talk of who comes next.A handful of prominent potential future candidates made the rounds here, including the governors: Florida’s Ron DeSantis, Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin, Arkansas’ Sarah Huckabee Sanders and South Dakota’s Kristi L. Noem, as well as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. There were also the senators: Vance, Marco Rubio (Fla.), Tim Scott (S.C.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.).Some would-be 2028 contenders spoke from the main stage and threw their weight behind Trump, including 2024 Trump rivals DeSantis, Haley and Scott. Rubio, whom Trump seriously considered as his veep pick, also scored a speaking slot and sat next to Trump on Wednesday in his box in the convention arena.Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) concluded that based on speeches from many of the rising GOP stars Tuesday night, “the 2028 Republican nomination is not secure.”“I mean there are a lot of people starting with Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley who clearly, clearly aren’t done and shouldn’t be and who are widely accepted,” he said. “Do I think people are positioning? For sure.”Haley, who was viewed by Never Trumpers as their best bet during the 2024 primaries, did end up in Milwaukee after a last-minute schedule change. Despite their rivalry, she encouraged voters to back her former foe in a prime-time speech and gave him her “strong endorsement, period.”Haley, however, did no other public events at the convention.Noem and Youngkin addressed a breakfast hosted by an influential evangelical group. Tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who also ran in 2024, mingled on the convention floor with delegates Thursday night before Trump’s speech. Sanders spoke at a lunch hosted by the National Federation of Republican Women.The interest in the future was evident on the patio of an elegant Italian villa overlooking Lake Michigan on Wednesday, where DeSantis reintroduced himself to Iowa Republican voters. (He placed second in their caucuses this year).Iowa delegates lunched alongside Sen. Joni Ernst and other high-ranking Republicans, chatting about the past two days and abuzz about the Vance speech they were anticipating later that night. DeSantis then walked onto the grand terrace. He was a familiar face who had crisscrossed their state for months, braving all manner of weather to deliver a message about how great Florida was under his leadership.Many Iowans said they had voted for Trump in their caucuses, but it wasn’t because they disliked DeSantis. It just wasn’t his time.DeSantis didn’t talk about the Trump-Vance ticket. Instead, he touted his accomplishments: passing a bill to reduce government spending, overhauling the higher education system and squashing pro-Palestinian protests on campuses. He complimented Iowa’s conservative bent, comparing it to Florida.“It’s not just about winning the election,” he said. “It’s like all we talk about is like the horse race and all this stuff. The most important thing is going to be doing the job.”Ernst insisted there’s “no heir apparent” to Trump.“Everybody will come and everybody will compete, and that’s a really important thing,” she said.The 2028 jockeying may begin especially early because Trump can only serve one four-year term after already clocking four years in the White House, if he wins in November. Vance is closely aligned with Trump’s populist message, and his allies argue that by picking him, Trump has essentially anointed the heir apparent and successor to his MAGA movement. Some Republicans also see Trump’s decision to choose Vance as a sign that the “America First” version of the GOP is here to stay, even when he is no longer the leader of the party.Trump “picked the candidate four years from now, and that’s a significant part of all of this,” said Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who is running for Senate. “J.D. Vance is now the front-runner to be the president after Donald Trump.”Trump’s decision to elevate Vance cements the Ohio Republican’s meteoric political rise after the former venture capitalist and “Hillbilly Elegy” author has served in the Senate for less than two years. Yet there’s no guarantee that Trump and Vance will have the same relationship in four years. Trump broke with his former vice president Mike Pence after he refused to overturn the 2020 election results, and many of Trump’s former aides have warned against a second Trump term.Republicans also note that many rising GOP stars, including those who ran in 2016, passed on a 2024 run because of Trump’s decision to seek another term.“There’s going to be a lot of pent-up energy, and it could be a very crowded 2028 race on the Republican Party because so many took a pass this time,” said Terry Sullivan, who was Rubio’s 2016 campaign manager. “It’s highly unusual that folks who ran in a previous cycle didn’t run.”Many of the big names hit the early state circuit in Milwaukee, making it a point to meet with delegates and speak to influential conservative organizations. Youngkin, for example, attended a breakfast with the South Carolina delegation.New Hampshire GOP Chair Christopher Ager said that while potential 2028 contenders focused many of their public comments on backing Trump, they are meeting with delegates in early primary states to introduce themselves.He referenced one joint event with delegates from New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, key states in any nominating contest, with some possible 2028 candidates, although he declined to say who those people would be. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who also ran against Trump, and Ramaswamy were spotted walking into the event.“We’re meeting with people who could be seen as prospective candidates while we’re here,” Ager said. “Everyone knows that it will be an open seat in 2028, so it’s not too early to quietly lay the groundwork.”Republican aides and strategists cautioned that it’s too early to predict where the country will be four years from now and noted the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic ticket in 2024.Several early state delegates cautioned that while potential candidates may soon be descending on their state, they want to see what the prospective candidates will do next. And after witnessing the hard-fought battle for the 2024 GOP nomination, they realize that some may need to mend some wounds.“It’s not pleasant when anyone loses,” Iowa alternate delegate April Melton said. “They need time to recover.”Some convention attendees supported the argument that Trump’s decision to pick Vance could be an obstacle for other future contenders because he would have the upper hand with the party’s base. GOP delegates named him first when asked about 2028, at this week’s convention.“I love the idea of Trump mentoring this young man,” said Kathleen Winn, an alternate delegate from Arizona in her 60s. Like others, she took note of Vance’s forceful defenses of Trump. “People start to say, ‘Oh, he got indicted, or whatever,’” she said. “J.D. has been able to break it down from an unemotional, legal point of view.”Leanna Derrick, a delegate from New Mexico, called DeSantis one of her “heroes” as she left a Milwaukee panel where he spoke. Derrick has no problem with DeSantis running in 2028 but said Vance is the obvious successor.“That’s what I’d like to see — provided he doesn’t pull a Mike Pence,” she said."

And Herrin had a note of caution for all of us: We may not be out of the woods yet.Herrin said the computer outages — which experts largely attributed to a glitch in a software update to Windows computers from the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike — was so unusual that there could be unexpected and lingering problems with websites and computer systems for a few days.“This will not be a normal week,” Herrin said. “Bake a little flexibility into your plans.”But Frank Dickson, group vice president of security and trust at the technology research firm IDC, said CrowdStrike quickly dispatched a fix to its software error.

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.If you paid a bill online in the past day, placed an online shopping order, booked a travel reservation, made a medical appointment or were waiting for a direct deposit of your paycheck, Herrin said it’s a good idea to double check that what you expected to happen actually did happen.If you’re one of the Windows computer users who saw a “blue screen of death,” or BSOD, on Friday — the cheeky nickname for a Windows error message that can keep computers stuck in a loop of restarting — I’m sorry.If it’s a work computer, know that everyone in your company’s IT department is having a terrible day trying to fix the problem. CrowdStrike and Microsoft said they are working with businesses to restore affected computers to normal working order.If it’s your personal computer, my colleague Tatum Hunter wrote that your best bet is to restore your computer to a version before the update.To do so, press the power button on your PC — but before it starts up, press and hold the power button to turn it back off. Do this three times in a row. After the third time, you should see some advanced settings appear. Go to “advanced options,” then “system restore.”In Manila, Herrin eventually was able to rebook the flight and extend his hotel stay. He joked that he planned to enjoy his unexpected extra time in the Philippines, maybe by doing “analog” activities like taking walks."

Dutch airline KLM said before 11 a.m. that its flight disruptions had been “almost completely resolved.” Delta said it had resumed some flights and issued travel waivers to would-be passengers, which they could use to rebook their flights within the next several days. But United Airlines warned that “schedule disruptions may continue.”Delta has resumed some flights after a vendor technology issue impacting airlines and businesses globally. We’ve issued a travel waiver and customers can monitor and manage their itineraries on https://t.co/oAYy2BBlGo or the Fly Delta app. For more info: https://t.co/GSbpUNpU9dSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg posted Friday on X that officials are continuing to monitor the impact of the IT outages on transportation systems across the country.“Many flights are impacted as systems recover — passengers should check with their airline for updates and visit our website for more on passenger protections,” he wrote.Several hospitals and health systems around the world reported technology issues Friday, forcing some to pause procedures or encourage patients to stay home if they could.Massachusetts General Hospital posted on X that “all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits” were canceled Friday. Its emergency rooms remained open.In England, the National Health Service said the outage was causing issues with its patient record systems at general practitioner offices. “The NHS has long standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP,” it wrote in a statement.

WaPo_119,Democrats at impasse as Biden digs in amid mounting calls to drop out,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/democrats-biden-withdraw-clash/,2024-07-20 02:07:02.833596,,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — President Biden’s team reiterated Friday that he is fully committed to staying in the presidential race, while the largest group yet of additional Democrats publicly urged him to step aside, setting up a pivotal clash that is expected to intensify this weekend and could reach its culmination next week.Biden is “absolutely” staying in the race, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” calling him the “best person to take on Donald Trump” and suggesting that the growing angst among top Democrats about Biden’s candidacy does not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.Less than two hours after O’Malley Dillon’s appearance, four more House Democrats released a joint statement calling on Biden to “pass the torch,” the broadest collective effort from Congress thus far — and a move some officials said was representative of a larger, growing groundswell against Biden among lawmakers that could erupt into view if Biden does not step aside over the weekend.“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,” Reps. Jared Huffman (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Tex.), Jesús “Chuy” García (Ill.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) told Biden in the statement.Not long after, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-Nev.) became the third Democratic senator to publicly call for Biden to step aside, highlighting an unmistakably ramped-up push in Congress to oust the president from the ticket. The number of congressional Democrats urging the president to bow out has now risen past 30, about 12 percent of all Democrats in Congress.The increasingly intense impasse between supporters and skeptics of the president suggests there is no end in sight to the Democratic infighting that has surrounded Biden’s candidacy as both sides have grown more obstinate, and more willing to allow the standoff to play out in public.It is clear they see this moment very differently. Some people close to Biden are urging Democrats to give him the time and space to end his candidacy on his own, to end his half-century of political life with grace. Other Democrats say they have spent weeks giving the president every opportunity to leave with dignity on his own terms, only to see them all rebuffed.Yet others are fully backing the president’s continued candidacy. O’Malley Dillon has told campaign aides privately that recent reports that Biden is considering imminently dropping out of the race are far removed from reality, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Top White House adviser Anita Dunn has echoed that sentiment, giving some campaign aides confidence that Biden remains committed to being the Democratic nominee even as he appears to be losing the confidence of significant portions of his party.Yet the pressure to push Biden aside was only intensifying Friday ahead of what some officials described as a crucial weekend, given that the Democratic National Convention is a month away — and the party is planning a virtual nominating process sooner to lock in the nominee.That has fostered a “now or never” mood on Capitol Hill, with multiple lawmakers discussing a public effort to oust Biden from the race. A new Political Action Committee called “Pass the Torch” announced Friday that it was launching ads in Washington and Rehoboth Beach, Del., urging Biden to end his reelection bid. A group of Democratic delegates gathered via Zoom on Friday to discuss how an open convention would work.All the while, Biden remained behind closed doors at his home in Rehoboth Beach, where he is self-isolating after testing positive for the coronavirus and experiencing mild symptoms earlier this week. In a statement Friday, Biden said he planned to return to the campaign trail next week.“The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” Biden said in the statement, a response to Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. “Together, we will win.”The makeup of the four lawmakers behind Friday’s joint statement is significant, since they are all member of larger groups that have expressed support for Biden. Pocan is the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has largely stuck with Biden. Garcia is a member of the Hispanic Caucus, whose leadership endorsed Biden last week. Veasey is a member of the Black Caucus, whose leadership has also stood with the president.“Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they wrote.Both Huffman and Veasey directly raised concerns to the president about his ability to win during separate calls that lawmakers held with Biden last weekend.Heinrich, the New Mexico senator, suggested Biden could not win against Trump. “The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy,” he said. “We must defeat him in November, and we need a candidate who can do that.”Heinrich is running for reelection in New Mexico, a state that Biden won by 11 points in 2020, but aides say the presidential race is tied in the state.More lawmakers are expected to follow suit in coming days, as polls appear to be solidifying with Biden trailing Trump in important battleground states. That would create the spectacle of a party torn apart and publicly at war with its leader, but a growing number of Democrats are concluding there could be little alternative.“There’s been a gradual shift — it may be accelerating somewhat — with a few more obviously, speaking publicly, and a good number privately,” said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues and the White House. “I think also the mood in the White House or the campaign also seems to be shifting somewhat, so I think the two trends are complimentary.”But Biden’s team is showing no sign of shifting.On Friday, Biden campaign aides pointed to support the president had received from key figures including liberal lawmakers like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). During a lengthy Instagram Live session Thursday night, Ocasio-Cortez told supporters that ousting Biden would lead to chaos and harm the party’s chances of defeating Trump. Sanders, speaking on “Morning Joe” offered a full-throated endorsement of Biden, saying the president could help Democrats win “in a big way.”Campaign officials said they were planning multiple press events and volunteer events in the coming days, aiming to showcase that Biden’s candidacy was forging ahead.The campaign also touted Friday’s endorsement of Biden by BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The group said in a statement that Biden and Vice President Harris “have delivered for the Latino community.”But not all members of the PAC or the Hispanic Caucus are supportive of Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket. Reps. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Mike Levin (D-Calif.) are among House Democrats who have called for the president to leave the race. The group had agreed to endorse Biden before Biden’s debate performance on June 27, which rocked the president’s candidacy after he struggled to complete his sentences, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.Members of BOLD PAC, which includes a majority of Hispanic Democrats in Congress, were only alerted shortly before the release went out.More House Democrats are in discussions about how and when to publicly call on Biden to step down. Some believe there is no need to participate in sinking an already waterlogged ship, others want to give Biden the weekend and still more, like the four who jointly spoke out Friday, believe it is important to keep up the pressure.In the Senate, a group of Democrats is also discussing whether to come forward as a group to call on Biden to step aside. They are also discussing the timing — where to do it after the weekend or sooner, according to three people familiar with the discussions.The mood among Democrats senators has shifted against Biden’s candidacy just in the last few days, according to multiple senior aides. Last week, Democratic senators were divided. But as new polling has shown that states he easily won in 2022, including New Mexico and Virginia, are now essentially tied, Democrats are increasingly fearing they could lose if Biden heads the ticket.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is in a tough reelection in a conservative state, added his name to the calls to withdraw on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and his lieutenants spent the week continuing to hear from concerned members. They have not warned members against coming out against Biden, as they did in the days immediately after the debate. Instead, they are telling their colleagues to do what is best for their campaigns.Jeffries told reporters Friday he was continuing to support the Biden as “our nominee,” though his remarks were little changed from previous public comments, in which he has suggested the president needs to make a decision about his candidacy.Some in the president’s orbit suggest the mounting pressure campaign is counterproductive.“Message to everyone trying to affect the president’s decision about whether to pass the torch: GIVE JOE BIDEN THE SPACE & TIME TO PROCEED AT HIS OWN PACE.” Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School who has spoken to Biden since the debate, wrote on X on Friday. “Stop pressuring the man. He has earned the right to your respect.”The debate over Biden’s candidacy became even more tense in the aftermath of the Republican National Convention, which ended with a lengthy, meandering and at times dark speech by Trump. The display convinced several Democratic officials that Trump could be beaten if the party has the right candidate.“Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans,” Biden said in a statement after the speech. “Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.”Many in the party remain unconvinced. The 30-second ads by “Pass the Torch” feature Democratic voters in Pennsylvania urging Biden to step aside. Delegates Are Democracy, another newly formed group, held a Zoom for delegates to the Democratic National Convention to inform them how an open primary would work if Biden were to step aside.Elaine Kamarck, an expert on presidential nominations and a member of the Democratic National Committee, told the gathered delegates that if Biden were to bow out of the race, the road to an open convention could be fast-moving and “fascinating.”“Basically, think of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,” she said.Amy B Wang and Mariana Alfaro contributed to this report."
WaPo_120,"In Trump’s bandage, gauzy symbols abound",https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/2024/07/19/trump-ear-bandage/,2024-07-20 02:00:02.833596,,"If you have to hit the floor while a would-be assassin tries to take your life, you should get to wear whatever kind of bandage you want for as long as you want to wear it with no judgment from anyone else. But I think at this point we can all also acknowledge that Donald Trump’s bandage became something in addition to a medical necessity at the Republican National Convention. It became a dominant symbol — of woundedness, of triumph, of the stories that Trump tells about himself, and the story he needs voters to believe about the country.What was it, physically? According to Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Tex.), the former White House physician who said he originally affixed the bandage to Trump’s ear, the bandage was “bulked up a bit because you need a bit of absorbent. You don’t want to be walking around with bloody gauze on his ear.” Ears “bleed like crazy,” Jackson told the New York Times, and his professional solution was what we all spent four days staring at from our televisions: a tidy white rectangle hovering on the former president’s ear.At any rate. People who were shot at get to wear what they want, but the story of the RNC ear bandages got weird when the bandages began appearing on the ears of attendees who had not been wounded in a shooting. I’m trying to think of a way to say this plainer, in case there is any confusion: uninjured supporters of Trump at the Republican National Convention spent the week taping white squares on their ears because, as one supporter told the BBC, she wanted to show Trump “how much we love him.”Her bandage was not clean and tidy, it was rumpled and improvised as if, seeking her own absorbent, she had turned to Kleenex or Kotex. News organizations assembled photo galleries: Another attendee’s pretend bandage seemed to be stuck to his hair, not his ear, and yet another’s looked like it was literally a piece of printer paper Scotch-taped to his head. There is a Spanish phrase, pena ajena, which doesn’t have a direct English translation, but which refers to the idea that someone else has done something so embarrassing that you feel humiliated on their behalf.The aesthetics of the original bandage were interesting, only because they seemed to be at odds with Trump’s usual presentation of strength, power, masculinity. The man is notoriously vain, and one imagines that if you have time, money and the resources of the entire Republican National Committee at your disposal, you could commission a bespoke flesh-colored bandage, maybe something contoured and discreet. On medical Twitter, doctors and nurses puzzled through the mechanics of Trump’s bandage in great detail: it didn’t have to look that way, they assured the rest of us.But instead, for four days running, Trump protected his ear with the most conspicuous dressing imaginable. If the bandage had instead been bedazzled with the Trump logo, even that would have been more expected — the showman has rarely missed a branding opportunity. The plain white gauze, though, was something else. It was distinctly un-Trumplike. It was clunky, it was pedestrian, it was awkward. Above all else, though, it was a reminder.The lasting, horrifying image from the Butler, Pa., rally last Saturday was of Trump, surrounded by Secret Service agents, shouting “fight” with blood smeared across his face.The bandage reminded us of those initial terror-filled moments, and of the way Trump had behaved during them. This man had long been dogged by insinuations of physical cowardice — he was protected from the draft by bone spurs — but now, under a hail of bullets, shedding blood in pursuit of public service, Trump had rehabilitated his origin story with a defiantly pumped fist. You could loathe the man, and still recognize that the optics of his instincts looked badass.I was wounded, the bandage said. Never forget that they tried to wound me.In this way, the bandage was a familiar message. It was, in fact, the message that, over the years has become one of Trump’s most revisited messages: that he has been uniquely and unfairly hurt. Persecuted and prosecuted by any number of nefarious villains: the liberal left, the deep state, the activist judges, lowly poll workers, Dominion voting machines, Barack Obama, Joe Biden.“He chose to endure abuse, slander and persecution,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump’s running mate, from the convention center podium on Wednesday, as he described Trump’s political journey.“Nobody has endured more than what he’s been through,” said South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R).And so on, continuing with Thursday night’s convention speeches: “They’ve thrown everything at Donald Trump,” said Hulk Hogan, “ … and he’s still standing and kicking their butts.”“They’ve tried everything to destroy his legacy, to destroy his family,” said Trump’s son Eric. “ … He has been ruthlessly silenced, slandered and attacked by a corrupt administration.” At one point he addressed his father directly: “We know, and America knows, that they’re not just after you, they’re after all of us and you just happen to be standing in their way.”I have been wounded. We have been wounded. Never forget that what they do to me, they are doing to you, but I am the one who will take it.Trump’s bandage was medically necessary, his doctor said. But for the supporters who fashioned their own make-believe Band-Aids, I wonder if there was a different kind of necessity: the understanding that the world can be a scary place and the belief that they had found a man who would take on their grievances and make them his own.When Trump himself took the stage Thursday night, his speech began as more subdued than the ones that had come before it. He had promised it would be unifying, not divisive. In the hours leading up to it, moving excerpts were released. Talking heads on CNN speculated that maybe he was a changed man, transformed, as many are, by near death. And there were, indeed, many moving sections: “I shouldn’t be here,” he told the audience, describing the shooting.But then, slowly, the 1½-hour-long speech went off script and back into familiar territory, which is to say, bizarre and often angry territory. He talked about “crazy Nancy Pelosi.” He talked about immigration, crime, transgender athletes, taxes, the Yankees, Hannibal Lecter, and sweet Moses only knows what else before eventually petering out and greeting his wife, Melania, on the stage for the balloon drop. He talked about “the partisan witch hunt that I’ve been going through for the past eight years.”He had been through something life-altering, but it wasn’t clear how much he had been altered.For Trump, the wounds are always on display.An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. The article has been corrected."
WaPo_121,"Biden wants government to stop buying single-use plastics, including soda bottles",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/19/single-use-plastic-pollution-biden/,2024-07-20 03:58:02.964619,,"The Biden administration Friday announced a commitment to phase out single-use plastics across the federal government, marking a significant step in tackling the growing plastic pollution crisis.As part of an expanded strategy to combat plastic pollution in the United States, the administration set a goal to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.The federal government is the largest buyer of consumer goods in the world and this action could “significantly impact the supply” of these ubiquitous plastic products, according to an 83-page report detailing the administration’s plan. The administration also wants tougher regulations on plastics manufacturers, a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The report highlights that more than 90 percent of plastic is made from fossil fuels.By leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power, the administration hopes its latest effort will help reduce air pollution, protect public health and shift markets toward more sustainable plastic alternatives.“Tackling plastic pollution and its associated impacts will require unprecedented action at every stage of the plastic life cycle — from reining in the pollution from petrochemical production … to reorienting infrastructure to ensure dramatic increases in recycling and reuse,” wrote Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Ali Zaidi, White House National Climate Advisor, in a letter attached to the report.The move to reduce plastic use domestically comes as the world is grappling with how to manage the staggering plastic waste problem.Upward of 460 million metric tons of plastic are produced every year, equivalent to the weight of more than 300,000 blue whales, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Much of the plastic that becomes waste are single-use products that can end up polluting land, waterways and oceans. As the hardy material breaks down in the environment, it creates microplastics — tiny particles smaller than five millimeters that have been found everywhere from Antarctic snow to inside human bodies.The Biden administration’s new report “so clearly lays out the severity and urgency of this crisis for our oceans, for our climate and for our communities,” said Anja Brandon, associate director of U.S. plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit group.“The fact that it calls for comprehensive action throughout the full life cycle of plastics is a new recognition that we can’t solve this crisis without taking upstream action to reduce the amount of plastics we’re making and using in the first place,” Brandon said.She added that the federal government’s commitment to phase out single-use plastics is a “monumental” step.“When they throw their weight behind something, we know they can significantly shift the market,” she said.Biden’s commitments, however, come with a caveat. If former president Donald Trump returns to office following the election in November, it is widely anticipated that his administration would roll back a number of existing environmental and climate rules.Some environmental advocates emphasized the need for action and implementation following Friday’s announcement.“While commitments are important, the ‘how’ is essential,” Erin Simon, vice president and head of plastic waste and business at World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. She noted that the new report “provides the strategic analysis needed to meet these goals.”“We’re heartened to see this report doesn’t shy away from the negative impacts that plastics have on human health and analyzes the problem through the full life cycle of plastic,” Simon said. “Cleaning up the global plastic mess must start at home. And today under President Biden and Vice President Harris’ leadership, the U.S. government is doing exactly that. The world is watching; now is the time for bold commitments and concrete action on plastic.”Representatives from oil and petrochemical industries did not immediately respond on Friday to the report."
WaPo_122,The Republican convention was weird. Then they played Beethoven.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/19/melania-trump-beethoven-convention-entrance/,2024-07-20 03:57:02.964619,,"In an evening full of supremely weird moments, this was one of the weirdest: the long, arcing line of Beethoven’s greatest Adagio, the third movement of his Ninth Symphony, creating a sense of wonder and expectation as former first lady Melania Trump made her entrance at the Republican National Convention. The vast majority of the music heard at the four-day event in Milwaukee was pop, rock, rap or country, sonic Americana with a tendency to fist-pumping, headbanging aural fervor. And then the recorded notes of an orchestra playing Beethoven began to filter out of the amped-up sound system.Simply as a moment of drama, it was effective. Beethoven’s majestic but tender slow movement unfolds over more than 15 minutes, with melodic lines and variations that soar ever higher as they unfold. The hymn-like first theme gathers around it faster-moving motifs, like beauty personified collecting ever more acolytes and worshipers. The Adagio clears away the clouds and ruckus of the preceding two movements, setting the stage for the finale, with its choral Ode to Joy, perhaps the greatest symphonic music ever written.The dramatic effectiveness on Thursday night was similar to an actor beginning a monologue in a hushed voice. It quieted the room (at least a little). The striking contrast with everything heard earlier — not just the music but the blood-and-guts oratory — was bewildering, and in the midst of the temporary bewilderment, Melania emerged in her trim, bright-red skirt suit.Some things on the program of the final evening were jaw-droppingly weird, like Hulk Hogan’s speech, with its shirt-tearing reveal of a Trump T-shirt, a fanatical mashup of confessional, coming-out and Superman’s quick change. Other things, like the choice of Beethoven, were deeply weird, tapping into the subterranean depths of the surreal that are fundamental to the aesthetic of the Republican Party now under the absolute control of Donald Trump.The last movement of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 includes a setting of a Friedrich Schiller poem, the Ode To Joy, which is an extended paean to love, brotherhood and belonging. An instrumental setting of its famous melody serves as the anthem of the European Union, and the symphony is often played at moments of great hope and sometimes sorrow. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Leonard Bernstein performed it in Berlin, with an orchestra of musicians from both sides of the Iron Curtain. That remains one of the most spectacularly moving performances of the piece — or any work of music — of the last half century at least.Few other works of music are as effective at creating the incredibly dangerous but ecstatic feeling that many politicians and all demagogues hope to stir in their followers. It melts away the ego lines between individuals, creating a sense of collective rather than individual identities. In any decent performance of the symphony, you may feel yourself broadly in love with everyone around you during the tender passages used for Melania’s entrance.Serenading an audience fresh from four days of divisive rhetoric, immigrant bashing and attacks on LGBT people with music from a sonic icon of Europe’s post-World War II quest for peace and dignity was either brilliant in its perversity or perversely hypocritical. Ordinary political advisers, those steeped in decades of the American political process, might have advised against music that underscores Melania’s Slovenian origins. Given the GOP’s isolationism, they might have bristled at the idea of anything that suggests connection to Europe, with its NATO alliance and its opposition to the territorial ambitions and militarism of Vladimir Putin. Sensitive to any accusation of elitism, they might have avoided use of classical music entirely, given its long (but mostly baseless) association with listeners who are rich and educated.There were many good reasons not to use this music. Even the few good reasons to use it — among them the failed efforts by some in the convention to suggest a new, unifying tone — don’t really explain it. The larger associations of Beethoven’s symphony were almost certainly lost on the. audience. Even knowledgeable listeners would need first to recognize the excerpt of the third movement and then recall the larger message of the whole symphony.But Trumpian aesthetics work through a particular type of co-option, the appropriation of culture not to own it, but to neutralize it. Beethoven will never become Melania’s theme music, but its brief appearance at the convention makes it just one more surprise, one more dizzying moment. When the double-takes just keep coming, nothing surprises or shocks anymore. Trumpworld chews through the bizarre like Joey Chestnut devours hot dogs.The surreal is essential to this. When everything is weird, nothing is normal. When everything is an exception to the rule, then there are no rules. Melania Trump has consistently been the exception to almost all the received rules of what it means to be a first lady, from her fashion choices to her weirdly postmodern gothic Christmas decorations to her more recent extended disappearance from the public stage. The music used for her entrance indicates that will continue, underscoring how she remains central to the Republican Party by consistently standing aside from it in symbolic ways.That raises larger questions about how rank-and-file Republicans process the deluge of dissonance from events like this one. A political party whose biggest applause line is Trump’s promise to execute the largest deportation in American history turning to Beethoven’s message of brotherhood and compassion? If no one senses the oddity of that, it’s only because there was so much competition from other odd, hyperbolic and hypocritical extremities of rhetoric.Schiller embedded in his poem, and Beethoven set to music, one line that stands apart from the rest. All those who cannot participate in this collective identity, says Schiller, should “slink away from this gathering in tears!” For a few more months, the right to slink away is still protected by the Constitution."
WaPo_123,At least 40 Haitian migrants killed in boat fire,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/haiti-migrants-boat-fire/,2024-07-20 03:32:02.964619,,"At least 40 Haitian migrants were killed and scores were injured after the boat they were traveling on caught fire off the northern coast of Haiti, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Friday.The boat, which was carrying at least 80 people and headed to Turks and Caicos, left the northern city of Cap-Haïtien around 4 a.m. Wednesday. It caught fire a short time later near Labadee. The Haitian coast guard rescued more than 40 survivors, the IOM said.“This devastating event highlights the risks faced by children, women and men migrating through irregular routes, demonstrating the crucial need for safe and legal pathways to migration,” Grégoire Goodstein, the IOM’s chief in Haiti, said in a statement.The fire came the same week that a second contingent of Kenyan police officers arrived in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince as part of a U.N.-backed international security mission to beat back the heavily armed gangs that control at least 80 percent of the city and to allow new elections.Gangs killed at least 3,250 people in Haiti from January to May, the U.N. office in Haiti reported last month, up more than 30 percent from the previous five months. The violence has forced more than 570,000 people to flee their homes.The security challenges have exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in a country long saddled with endemic poverty and where roughly half of the people suffer from acute hunger.“Haiti’s socioeconomic situation is in agony,” Goodstein said. “The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more.”Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.More than 86,000 migrants have been forcibly returned to Haiti this year by neighboring countries, the IOM said.In the weeks since several hundred Kenyan police officers arrived in Haiti, they have joined the Haitian National Police on street patrols, but they have not yet started operations to pacify gang-controlled neighborhoods.Dennis B. Hankins, the U.S. ambassador to Haiti, said he expects those operations to begin “within the next few weeks.”As the violence has worsened, Haitians have often taken to the sea to seek refuge elsewhere, many of them making risky trips on rickety boats or other makeshift vessels that are not fit for such voyages. The Turks and Caicos Islands, a British overseas territory, is a common destination. Others head for the Bahamas or the Florida coast.The U.S. Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defense Force on Thursday announced that they were suspending the search for 60 Haitian migrants that may have left the Bahamas for Florida on July 4 on a boat that was experiencing engine issues.The IOM says that collecting figures on the number who die at sea is challenging because of “the remote nature of maritime routes, the secrecy in which boats set out and the lack of information on trajectories.”“Many, many boats leave [Haiti],” said Antoine Lemonnier, an IOM spokesman in the country. “Many are intercepted by foreign coast guards … and probably many are dying and we will never know about it.”"

Vance’s anti-woke ideology on foreign affairs,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/19/jd-vance-leaked-memo-state-department/,2024-07-20 03:27:02.964619,,"Before J.D. Vance became Donald Trump’s pick for vice president, he was known in the most powerful offices of the State Department as the single biggest obstacle to confirming career ambassadors in the Senate.Armed with a questionnaire on hot-button social issues about gay and lesbian rights, gender transition care and hiring practices related to diversity, equity and inclusion, Vance (R-Ohio) held up for more than a year the nominations of dozens of diplomats assigned to serve in posts across the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.1/5A copy of Vance’s questionnaire, obtained by The Washington Post and published here for the first time, asked would-be ambassadors if they would increase the number of “gender-neutral bathrooms” in U.S. embassies, boost resources for “gender dysphoria and gender transition care” and raise the “Progress flag” during “regional Pride celebrations.”“The publics of many of our allies, and those countries we seek to build stronger relationships with, have traditional Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu moral values,” Vance wrote in the questionnaire he provided to all nominees. “If confirmed, how would you explain to them what the United States’ promoting ‘human rights for LGBTQ people’ would look like in their country?”Vance’s memo and intensive scrutiny of President Biden’s ambassador nominees reflects his view that cultural elitism has infected America’s diplomatic corps and needs to be rooted out through extraordinary vetting efforts, said U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door meetings.Neither Vance’s Senate office nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment for this story.For many conservatives, Vance’s oversight was a welcome response to long-standing concerns within the GOP that the United States has elevated left-leaning social values at the expense of American interests and alienating partners in more conservative regions of Africa, Latin America or Asia.Many liberals saw the move as a bid to prioritize his conservative agenda in a way that delayed qualified nominees from taking assignments critical to maintaining U.S. standing in the world.For career diplomats, the questionnaire forced a tricky dance as they tried to assuage the Ohio senator without contradicting President Biden’s assertion that LGBTQ rights were “human rights.”“It puts career diplomats in a bind to be asked to go on the record commenting on how they would support policies that are favored by the current administration but may not be by the next,” said Barbara Stephenson, a former ambassador to Panama who served in senior positions under both Republican and Democratic administrations.“One party may support climate change agreements or DEI, and another may not,” she added. “Those career diplomats are required to support the policy of the administration in power, even when that means changing positions they have previously argued for or against.”A year of back-and-forth discussions between Vance and the State Department eventually led to the senator releasing most of his holds in April.At the height of his campaign, Vance placed holds on more than 30 nominees for Senate-confirmed positions at the State Department. The effect of a hold slows the confirmation process and forces the party in power to call for individual votes instead of the faster method of moving nominations through unanimous consent. The delay leaves vacancies at embassies that are filled temporarily by lower-level officials who don’t enjoy the same status as presidential nominees.Vance, a Midwest native and best-selling author of the memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” has said the Iraq War played a formative role in the development of his worldview. He was in high school during the 2003 invasion and decided to enlist in the Marines because he “believed the propaganda of the George W. Bush administration that we needed to invade,” he said in an April speech on the Senate floor.After deploying, he realized that the architects of the war had “lied” and the “promises of the foreign policy establishment of this country were a complete joke,” he said.Vance brought that suspicion of the establishment into his discussions about ambassadors with Biden’s senior aides, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his top congressional adviser, Assistance Secretary of State Naz Durakoğlu.None of the nominees whom Vance held up drew his ire like Stephanie S. Sullivan, a career diplomat chosen to be Biden’s envoy to the African Union.Vance accused Sullivan, the former ambassador to Ghana who had overseen an embassy that flew the Pride flag, of being “woke” and promoting a “progressive social policy” on gender identity.“Why do we have a diplomatic corps that is taking a hotly contested issue in an American political context and demanding the African nations follow the lead of the far-left instead of doing what they think that they should do?” he said in remarks on the Senate floor.The State Department said Sullivan’s decades-long career in the Foreign Service were “exemplary” and Vance’s “unfounded criticism against her work do not accurately reflect her service to our country.”Liberal critics of Vance question his opposition to the U.S. playing an active international role on LGBTQ issues.“The United States has a responsibility to champion human rights around the globe — and that includes the freedom for LGBTQ+ people to live and love without fear,” said Brandon Wolf, a spokesman with the Human Rights Campaign. “Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are cut from the same anti-LGBTQ+ cloth and have made clear that, should they get the keys to the Oval Office, they will demolish America’s values on the world stage.”Vance’s defenders say his efforts will help make U.S. diplomacy in the developing world more successful.“It is not out of line to insist that ambassadors are professionally-suited to focusing on the job at hand, as opposed to trying to push what, in most of these countries will be viewed as ultraradical social issues,” said Wade Miller, vice president of the conservative think tank Center for Renewing America. “Vance is in the upper tier of Republicans who have been talking about these issues and taking them on seriously.”The State Department said the Biden administration stands by its efforts to “ensure that every person, everywhere, can live free from violence and discrimination, with their equal rights respected.” The White House has vowed to push back against the GOP’s anti-woke efforts, including by repealing a provision in a government spending bill that essentially bans rainbow Pride flags from being flown above U.S. embassies.Politico reported last July that Vance had sent the questionnaire to nominees but did not obtain a copy of the document and Vance declined to provide it. Unlike other GOP firebrands known for holding up presidential nominees like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) or Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), Vance’s extensive efforts were unique in that he does not sit on the committee that oversees the nominations — in this case, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.While Vance’s skepticism of Biden’s nominees ran deep, officials said he asked sincere questions about the threats and challenges in various countries. By April, Vance and State Department personnel broke through the year-long logjam after he felt confident that the administration would not place ideology over national security considerations, said the officials familiar with the discussion.At that point, he let roughly 30 nominations go forward except for two: Sullivan and David Kostelancik, Biden’s pick for ambassador to Albania.Last month, Sullivan was confirmed through a Senate procedure known as cloture. Kostelancik still awaits confirmation."
WaPo_126,Why do we blush? Research subjects watched their own karaoke to find out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/karaoke-singing-blushing-study-amsterdam/,2024-07-20 03:21:02.964619,,"Research participants faced a question when they arrived at an Amsterdam laboratory in 2020: Would they rather sing Adele’s “Hello” or “Let It Go” from the movie “Frozen?”The songs were among four options offered by European scientists who asked volunteers to perform what some consider a nerve-racking activity: karaoke. Many participants smiled coyly, fidgeted and scratched their arms while singing, Milica Nikolić, one of the researchers, told The Washington Post.But the scientists weren’t done embarrassing the volunteers. In the weeks after singing, the participants returned to the lab to watch a video of their performance while an MRI exam studied how much they blushed and which parts of their brains activated that blushing.The resulting study, published Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that most of the 40 participants blushed while watching themselves sing due to increased activity in the cerebellum, an area of the brain that has been found to help process emotions. The researchers said that the blushing was probably an automatic emotional response to feeling exposed.Most people have blushed while feeling self-conscious, embarrassed or ashamed. Biologist Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, once called blushing “the most peculiar and the most human of all the expressions.”Research has found that people blush when they watch videos of themselves that they find embarrassing. Nikolić, a professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Amsterdam, and her fellow scientists thought participants might feel vulnerable while watching themselves sing karaoke. They selected a subject group with ages 16 through 20 because research has found that people in that age group are more likely to feel self-conscious about how they’re perceived.For the music, they sought out songs that are hard to sing so that participants would be more likely to make a mistake and feel embarrassed, Nikolić said. Researchers also wanted the music to be popular among the subject group, she said, so the singers would notice their mistakes. They consulted music experts, who helped them rule out songs that might be too old for their subjects to spot those mistakes, such as ABBA’s 1975 hit “Mamma Mia.”The researchers settled on four songs: “Hello” by Adele, “Let It Go” by Idina Menzel, “All I Want For Christmas Is You” by Mariah Carey and “All The Things She Said” by Russian pop duo t.A.T.u.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.When the study began in the summer of 2020, participants visited the University of Amsterdam’s behavioral science lab, put on a pair of black headphones and sang the lyrics that appeared on a screen. Meanwhile, a camcorder filmed them.The participants returned in the following weeks to lie in an MRI machine that examined their brains and the temperature of their cheeks. Blood flow to the face increases during blushing, causing the temperature of the skin to increase and the skin to become redder.Before participants entered the tight MRI tube, researchers told them that other volunteers would also watch their singing performance, hoping that might make them more embarrassed.While undergoing the MRI, participants watched a video of themselves singing and a video of another participant singing on a screen above them. They wore headphones to block the loud beeping noises the machine produced.“We didn’t know if we would really be able to evoke any kind of blushing in a very small, dark room where there’s no audience,” Nikolić said.But researchers found that many participants’ cheek temperature increased by about one degree while they watched the videos of themselves singing — an indication that they were blushing. When viewing videos of other participants singing, most of the volunteers didn’t blush, Nikolić said. The cerebellum was most active when participants watched themselves sing, leading researchers to believe they were most engaged then and blushed as a spontaneous reaction.There’s still more to learn about blushing, Nikolić said. To better comprehend the behavior, she next plans to research blushing in young children who haven’t developed the cognitive skills to consider what other people think of them."
WaPo_127,‘The Originalism Trap’ is a cutting critique of the judicial theory,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/19/originalism-trap-madiba-k-dennie-review/,2024-07-20 03:18:02.964619,,"One of the more striking questions raised by the Supreme Court’s controversial recent decisions — such as its partial shielding of former president Donald Trump from criminal liability for his efforts to overturn the legitimate result of the 2020 presidential election — is how they square with the court’s embrace of originalism as a theory of constitutional interpretation. The court’s immunity decision, for instance, was mainly non-originalist in its reasoning, despite the fact that seven justices, including the liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, have shown some affinity for originalist interpretation.Originalism is the assertion that judges should be guided and limited in interpreting the U.S. Constitution solely by something original in it, although that “something” has shifted over time — from the original intent of its framers, to the original public meaning of its text, to the original law at the time of its adoption, with various sub-theories now debated. The theory has been sharply criticized. For one thing, skeptics say, its adherents have abandoned their search for the intent of the framers, a quixotic task that can lead only to indeterminate answers. Originalism as currently practiced is a modern invention whose methods have little to do with how the founding generation conceived of the Constitution or its method of interpretation, as recent historical research has shown. The theory’s advocates claim objectivity as one of its strengths, but the court relies on it haphazardly: It’s invoked when its purported results align with the priorities of conservative Republican activists — about individual gun rights, for instance — and ignored or modified when, to take two examples, the court wishes to invalidate affirmative action or strike down protections for the voting rights of minorities.In “The Originalism Trap: How Extremists Stole the Constitution and How We the People Can Take It Back,” Madiba K. Dennie, a civil rights lawyer and legal commentator, offers a trenchant, sharply worded critique of originalist theories — and a call  for a popular revolt against them. This is a timely project given that the number of Supreme Court justices who espouse such theories could increase if Donald Trump is elected to the White House again this fall.As Dennie puts it, “Originalism deliberately entombs historically marginalized groups’ legal claims to liberation.” She charges that its proponents tend to valorize the founding era, when Blacks, women and poor people were not covered in full, or in some cases at all, by the order that the Constitution created. By contrast, originalists have traditionally downplayed the importance of Reconstruction, the post-Civil War period when the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments were adopted, guaranteeing freedom, equality, citizenship and, to a lesser extent, voting rights for many Americans.Dennie isn’t the first to note this tension between originalism and the group identities of those who were excluded from the original compact. “The Originalism Trap” locates the theory’s origins in the debate over Brown v. Board of Education, during which the court asked lawyers in the case to evaluate the status of school segregation in the late 1860s, when the 14th Amendment was framed and ratified. Dennie shows that the segregationist congressmen who in 1956 signed the Southern Manifesto, which condemned the Supreme Court’s decision that segregated schools were unconstitutional, grounded their arguments in the “original” meaning and intent of the Constitution and its 14th Amendment. The state of Virginia did also when it defended its ban on interracial marriage, which the court struck down in Loving v. Virginia. It’s  true that the tradition of invoking the intentions of the founders and framers in constitutional discourse has a much longer (and not always ignominious) history, but Dennie is correct that the origins of our current fixation on originalism and the nature of the debate lie in the reaction to Brown and its legacy.“The Originalism Trap” critiques one recent court decision after another, covering gun rights, abortion, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, the census and other subjects. The Supreme Court and conservative advocates have blatantly manipulated and sometimes conveniently ignored originalist methods, Dennie argues, with the consistent result of making life worse for traditional outsider groups. For instance, she harshly critiques Chief Justice John Roberts’s summoning of the “equal [state] sovereignty” principle out of thin air to invalidate part of the Voting Rights Act when he couldn’t find a constitutional provision that would do the job, and shows that the decision is better explained by the chief justice’s long-standing hostility to the act as a matter of policy. “It was a lawless and racist decision,” she writes.But sometimes she lumps things into originalism’s penumbra that don’t quite fit, such as the court’s decision to uphold the Trump administration’s travel ban in Trump v. Hawaii, in which it credited the government’s assertion that the ban had nothing to do with prejudice against Muslims, and several other Trump-era cases about the census and apportionment of House seats. In these cases, some conservative activists did resort to specious originalist reasoning, but Dennie’s critiques aren’t primarily about applying or avoiding originalist methods. Her real concern seems to be that the court, and activists in a Trump-captured Republican Party, are pursuing fundamentally anti-democratic objectives.Dennie has no truck with those liberals, such as Justice Jackson, who have sought to reclaim originalism from conservatives. She concludes that “progressive originalists” and their methods, while preferable in their aims, “still constrain our constitutional imagination to an era where much of America was much worse off” and, in any event, are unlikely to convince conservatives. In lieu of any originalist camp, she propounds her own theory, which “emphasizes the transformative goals of the Reconstruction Amendments.” Dennie calls it “inclusive constitutionalism.”She argues for a method that emphasizes the “pro-democracy and antisubordination goals of the Reconstruction Amendments.” It’s not clear that her method is entirely distinguishable from that of the liberal originalists. She does focus on the text of the Constitution and the intentions behind it — in this case, the post-Civil War amendments — although she is more interested in the broad principles encompassed in those amendments than the constraints of text, intentions and context that occupy originalists. But originalist scholars, in both their liberal and conservative variants, have also recently attempted to make peace with the Reconstruction Amendments and the need to read their commands broadly.The true stakes of “The Originalism Trap” might be viewed from words contained in its subtitle: “We the People,” taken from the Constitution’s famous Preamble. Dennie’s book is best read as a critique of a court that seems hellbent on aggrandizing its own unaccountable power to decide partisan issues at the expense of the other branches of government and the American people. Appropriately enough, Dennie ends her book with a catalogue of the ways that lawyers, activists and ordinary Americans can  oppose a court whose anti-democratic impulses might one day be further reinforced. Whether or not readers agree with all of her analysis, those who fear that result will take solace and motivation from this strongly argued book.Kenneth W. Mack, a historian and a professor of law at Harvard, is the author of “Representing the Race: The Creation of the Civil Rights Lawyer” and a co-editor of the forthcoming “In Between and Across: Legal History Without Boundaries.”How Extremists Stole the Constitution and How We the People Can Take It BackBy Madiba K.

WaPo_129,Behind the scenes as Joe Biden lost control of the Democratic Party,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-democrats-drop-out/,2024-07-20 03:12:02.964619,,"The president of the United States had spoken — with 24 million Americans watching on TV. Every Democratic leader knew Joe Biden would continue his campaign. Statements like that used to mean something.But two days after that July 11 NATO news conference, the president found himself hunched in front of a stone fireplace in his Rehoboth Beach, Del., home, losing his temper. A war hero had just questioned the toll that age took on his ability to lead.“Tell me who enlarged NATO. Tell me who did the Pacific basin,” Biden snapped over Zoom at Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a decorated, retired Army Ranger, according to a recording of the virtual meeting with House Democrats. “Tell me who did something that you never done with your Bronze Star — and your — like my son — and, you know — proud of your leadership. But guess what? Well, what’s happening? We got Korea and Japan working together.”Crow was not the problem, however. He was the tip of the spear.Significant parts of the president’s campaign and White House team were saying privately that, after a disastrous debate performance on June 27, they no longer believed. Big donors were withholding money, demanding change. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) sat down with Biden after the news conference to warn the president that his candidacy imperiled Democratic hopes of taking back the House. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) shared the same warning days later. Delegates and party members sketched out a Plan B.Just a month earlier, all of those people had been united behind Biden, focused on the threat they saw in former president Donald Trump — the felon, Capitol riot agitator, election denier, self-proclaimed “day one” dictator and provocateur. The mantra of former House speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — “Diversity is our strength. Unity is our power” — still governed Democrats in June.But now even Pelosi was saying Biden needed more time to decide what he said he had already decided. Former president Barack Obama, Biden’s old running mate and governing partner, told allies that the path to victory had diminished. House Democrats, who had planned to cast Republicans as “chaos agents” in the fall, edged toward revolution. Seven more called for Biden to step aside on the day of his NATO news conference.The sudden collapse of Biden’s control over the party he brought to power, just four months before a presidential election, is without obvious historical precedent. Behind the scenes, people working inside the bowels of Democratic politics and government described the first three weeks of July: too extraordinary to be real, too unexpected to be believed.This story of Biden’s shrinking political power is based on interviews with more than three dozen people who played behind-the-scenes roles, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe painful private events and respond frankly to even more astounding public ones.The terrible Biden debate was followed by a far more terrible attempted assassination of Trump on live television July 13, from which the former president rose triumphant — fist in the air, blood streaked across his face. Biden’s polling, which held steady at first, began to erode.Then the 81-year-old president, traveling to campaign events to try to prove his vigor, contracted covid again. As Trump welcomed his new running mate this week in Milwaukee, video footage showed a delicate Biden struggling to get up the short stairs to Air Force One on his way to further isolation. Aides passed along the footage in dismay, a person familiar with the messages said. More than half a dozen Democratic House members called on Biden to step aside Friday after the conclusion of the Republican nominating convention, meaning that more than 30 lawmakers have now called on him to leave the race.Biden and his campaign team still maintain that nothing has changed. Even Jeffries continues to state publicly, as he did Friday, that Biden has “the ability, the capacity, and the track record to make a case to the American people that will result in us being successful in November.”“I don’t want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times we can answer that,” principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said Thursday morning.But Fulks spoke those words on behalf of a president no longer backed by an entire party. Two-thirds of the country, including 56 percent of Democrats, said in a Washington Post-ABC-Ipsos poll in early July that Biden should drop out. Biden is testing how far a president can lead when his followers go astray.“This is a brand-new political problem,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the Democratic group Third Way. “It is the wickedest of political problems because one, no one knows if there is a solution. And two, there’s no one to coalesce around. And three, everyone has their own theory of the case, so it’s just incredibly, incredibly complicated.”The first week after the debate had not gone well. No one, not even Biden, contested that. He needed to get out more, to prove his mettle, to replace the images of the doddering debate night in everyone’s mind. History will record that as things got worse, Biden fought harder.A long interview with Complex magazine, another with BET, a third with Lester Holt of NBC News. Over a 48-hour period, he had calls with the Congressional Asian American Pacific Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose political arm endorsed Biden on Friday. Lawmakers confronted him repeatedly to ask him to reconsider.The White House circulated a list of about 20 other elected leaders or union officials the president had spoken with on the plane or while traveling. About 75 members of Congress have reiterated their support for him. He rallied another raucous crowd in Detroit. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) closed ranks.“Can you hear the helicopter in the background?” Biden shouted through the phone to the Rev. Al Sharpton as he boarded a plane for Nevada, according to Sharpton. “We’ve got to keep going, Al.”Biden wanted Sharpton’s help to let his base know he would not give up. The debate over Biden’s future had become its own wound, Sharpton argued. “It undercuts potential enthusiasm. It confuses people who want him to fight,” he said. “If he steps down, then what? If you have an open convention, couldn’t that be a disaster?”One lawmaker who recently flew on Air Force One described only recently realizing the change in the president, after meeting with him several times over the last four years. Biden was speaking in hushed tones and could barely be heard across the table. Another lawmaker who spoke with Biden in the last few weeks described him as trailing off at times and calling the lawmaker by the wrong name, even as he seemed sharp at others.And a third lawmaker who recently interacted with Biden described him as mentally sharp, if frail, and serious about staying in.“He believes he can still win,” this person said. “I don’t think he is even spinning. He really thinks that everyone has always counted him out, and he has a chip on his shoulder, and he thinks he can win.”Trump advisers and operatives in key states began discussing how they could help keep Biden in the race, believing he is a weaker candidate than other options for Democrats. “If Democrats want to win Georgia, they’d be better off with a potted plant at the top of their ticket,” said Cody Hall, a top adviser to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), describing the current environment there.At the White House, officials stoked the fires they could control. The policy shop began to fast-track plans that had long been in the works, including a blueprint to create term limits for the Supreme Court and impose new ethics rules on the justices — catnip for the liberal base. Propeller heads finalized a plan for legislation to take away tax rebates from corporate landlords who increased rent by more than 5 percent a year, a potentially massive new federal intervention to reverse a major driver of inflation.Advance teams set up the big moment Tuesday at the NAACP National Convention in Las Vegas, where Biden would show he could paint the contrast with Republicans and debut his 5 percent rent cap.But reading from a teleprompter, he lost his way.“What I am about to announce,” he told the crowd. “They can’t raise it more than —” he trailed off. A pause. “Fifty-five dollars,” he finally said, for reasons that are not clear. The crowd cheered anyway.Inside the West Wing, informal camps formed and pressure mounted. At times, it seemed the code of loyalty that had long followed Biden’s operations was coming undone. Some engaged in black humor. Some advisers shifted their focus from planning a second term to planning ways to lock in the policy wins they had achieved before Trump would take over, according to a Biden administration official briefed on the work. Other officials said more effort was still being put into planning a future agenda. The preparations for a Trump takeover, they added, had begun months earlier, as a normal course of business.Some sought to rally the troops. “Keep the faith,” senior deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates posted on social media Thursday.Someone inside the White House anonymously texted Politico blaming “green badge staffers,” who do not have direct access to the West Wing like their “blue badge” peers, for the critical blind comments to the press. “This is out of line,” shot back Saloni Sharma, a top adviser to White House chief of staff Jeff Zients. “We are all a team and in this together.”Among those working on the Biden campaign effort, things were not much better: work hard, panic in private, take nothing personally.“The Republican Convention should light a fire under every American who wants to beat Trump and the Project 2025, and it certainly does for our campaign,” campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said Friday. “It reaffirms just why President Biden is in this fight.”One campaign aide said that junior and even some senior staff were in the dark about how Biden wanted to forge ahead. Text messages flew between Capitol Hill, administration officials and others, trying to figure out what was going on. Hungry journalists began reporting the impressions of their sources, who offered guesses about what might happen on the assumption that something different had to happen.“It has been intriguing to learn how many ‘Biden insiders’ seem to exist all of a sudden, who just happen to sound identical to the people who’ve been giving blind quotes doubting us for five straight years, during win after win after win,” Bates responded.Access to Biden, in calmer times, had been a stove-piped affair. Now people worried to each other that the future of the world order could be at stake. White House senior staff let it be known that their doors were open to underlings if anyone needed to talk through the difficulties.White House staffers did not contest that Biden was spending more time with two of his longest-serving, most loyal advisers: Mike Donilon, senior campaign adviser, and Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president. They argued that their expertise was more in demand. Both had argued that polling had become less meaningful.Some advisers traded accusations, without evidence, that top aides had misplaced loyalties, selfish interests, personal ambitions. Those aspersions even made it onto MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” the president’s favorite cable talkfest, days later.“The anger I hear are at the people that are keeping  him in a bubble or who may have their own interests, some financial, in keeping him in the race,” co-host Joe Scarborough said, laying out for the world the ugliness growing in Biden’s world. “That is anger from inside his own political camp, and it is widespread. It is widespread. Joe Biden deserves better.”It was a remarkable breakdown.As his NATO news conference concluded, Biden laid down a gauntlet. He would get out, he said, only if his advisers came to him and said, “There’s no way you can win.”“I thought he bought us some time with the NATO news conference,” one campaign adviser said. “There was a sigh of relief that night. If that had gone poorly, I think we all thought it was over within 24 hours.”Like others, this person said there had been lots of mistakes: Jill Biden’s Vogue photo shoot, a family meeting at Camp David, defensive Zoom calls, a sometimes polarizing communications strategy. There were increasingly dismal polls — and a sense the campaign might not last.“The polling isn’t good, and it feels like things are just getting worse every day,” the campaign adviser said.Political polling and analytics deal in probabilities, not absolutes like “No way.” They create snapshots in time, out of focus. Biden won in 2020 by 4.5 percentage points nationally, but he now trailed Trump by about 2 points, according to a Washington Post average of polls. Public surveys since the debate showed him down slightly in the must-win Northern swing states and by larger margins in Western and Southern states he hoped to win.Democratic House polls showed him polling significantly behind his 2020 margins in key districts. Senate polls showed him trailing statewide Democrats by double digits in battleground states.The campaign has been comforted by internal data showing that most of the people Biden has lost since the debate are unlikely to vote for Trump, suggesting they may come back. Most of them had not even watched the debate. But polling matters little when your party infrastructure is not behind you.Democratic strategists outside the campaign argued that if Biden were an incumbent senator or congressman running at around 40 percent in a five-way ballot test, as Biden has been doing in some surveys, he would get only symbolic financial support from the Democratic Senate or House campaign committees and their affiliated super PACs.Even before the debate, approval of Trump’s remembered presidency was running well ahead of Biden’s current one. Democrats assumed that Trump would get a bump out of his convention and probably a further boost in favorability once the trauma of the failed assassination was digested by voters.The fate of the Democratic Party now hinged on the gut sense of a man who has spent the last 52 years working in national politics. “This is just purely emotion. It is not a vigorous data-driven exercise,” said one Democratic strategist, describing the decision Biden had already made and would have to make again.“The truth of the matter is the decision is all in the hands of President Biden; there is not a practical way to prevent him from being the nominee if he wants to be the nominee,” said Jeff Weaver, the former political strategist for Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaigns. “If he were to demur, then the question becomes: What’s the process after that? Is it a coronation of Kamala Harris, which a lot of people are making the case for, or do we have some sort of truncated process?”Donors dreamed of a sort of reality TV show at the convention in August — a bake-off for the history books. Many had withheld tens of millions of dollars from Biden. Big-money people tried an escrow account for a new candidate, new polling about replacements for the nomination, money bombs for elected leaders who called on Biden to go. There was even a slogan: “No more dough until no more Joe.”The campaign budget had been built on the assumption that tens of thousands of people who are not yet engaged would give millions of dollars. There is no survey data to say whether they will show up in September with $10 or $25 checks. There is no poll to predict whether the party comes back together. Trump remains unpopular, opposed by large shares of voters. But at the moment he is more popular than Biden.James Carville, the Bill Clinton strategist who had long called for Biden to get out, worked the phone from a cruise ship off the coast of Alaska, trying to divine what happens next and get his party to a better place. He echoed others when he said he was not sure how Biden finds a way out of the spiral in which he is caught — a constant questioning about the path to victory that only makes the path to victory harder.“What they are asking is, ‘How are you going to win this?’” he said of the people he had spoken to. “No one is over it, and we are moving ahead anyway.”Paul Kane and Marianna Sotomayor contributed to this report."
WaPo_130,Biden’s appearances since debate have not stopped calls to drop out,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/biden-events-after-debate-videos/,2024-07-20 03:00:02.964619,,"In the three-plus weeks since his halting debate performance, President Biden has ramped up his public appearances to assure Americans, including members of his own party, that he is up to the task of a second term.Biden took to the campaign trail after the debate, holding rallies, sitting for interviews and making campaign stops. He’s made impassioned speeches and shown off policy knowledge, but he has also at times stumbled over words, mixed up names and meandered in speech.With his candidacy on the line as members of his party continue to call for him to step down, each appearance has been a high-stakes moment for Biden. Polls show that most Americans, including a majority of Democrats, would prefer another candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket.Here are six snapshots of Biden’s public appearances over the past three weeks — including times he’s parried concerns about his age successfully and times when his attempts have failed.The day Biden tested positive for covid, he returned to his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., to isolate. He was experiencing cold symptoms, including a cough and malaise, according to the White House.When he landed at Dover Air Force Base, Biden paused twice on the stairs as he disembarked the plane. He took two steps down before stopping, waving and smiling, then two more before pausing and gesturing again. He then descended the rest of the stairs. Reporters traveling with him noticed that he was moving slowly.During a visit to Nevada the day before, Biden flubbed his announcement of a new proposal to cap rental costs. The proposed policy would cap annual rent increases at 5 percent for tenants of landlords who own more than 50 units. Biden mistakenly announced that the policy would cap rent increases at $55.Biden was forceful in other parts of the speech, and the campaign stop reflected a major push from the White House to respond to voter anger over high housing prices. It was also an effort to reach Nevada voters, who have seen among the biggest jumps in housing costs nationwide and whose electoral votes Democrats have grown increasingly worried they could lose to Trump in November.A few days before his Nevada stop, Biden spoke forcefully at a campaign rally in Detroit on July 12, delivering an energetic vow to stay in the race. “There’s been a lot of speculation lately: ‘What’s Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?’ Well, here’s my answer: I am running, and we’re going to win!” he shouted.He vowed to beat Trump again, insisting that he would stay in the race and making an impassioned case for his candidacy. He also spoke about what he would do in his first 100 days of a second term.“I’m the nominee,” he said to chants of support from the audience. “You the voters, you decided. No one else. And I’m not going anywhere.”Introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at an event during the mid-July NATO summit in Washington, Biden mistakenly called him “President Putin,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden stepped away from the podium, then immediately caught himself. “President Putin! He’s going to beat President Putin. President Zelensky,” he corrected himself.That evening, Biden held a news conference seen as vitally important for rescuing his candidacy. Taking questions from reporters for almost an hour, the president showed his command of a range of topics but botched some words and names. Most notably, he referred to Vice President Harris as “Vice President Trump.”A little more than a week after the debate, Biden leaned on a familiar tactic: He joked about his age. Speaking at a church service in Philadelphia, he quipped, “I know I only look like I’m 40 years old, but I’ve been around a little bit.”“All kidding aside,” he continued, “I’ve been doing this a long time, and I honest-to-God have never been more optimistic about America’s future — if we stick together.”The church visit was part of a swing through Pennsylvania as Biden worked to drum up support in the key swing state while Democrats privately debated whether he should step aside.Among the many missteps Biden made at the debate was a moment when he appeared to lose his train of thought when responding to a question from CNN moderator Jake Tapper about tax cuts for the very wealthy.Biden suggested that raising taxes on the very wealthy — for whom Trump enacted tax cuts — would help wipe out the national debt incurred by Trump. Biden then began listing ways that additional tax influx could strengthen the health-care system. He appeared to lose his way, however, in describing the last item on his list, making a few false starts before ending with, “look — if — we finally beat Medicare—” He was cut off by the moderator, and the “We finally beat Medicare” line became one of his most notable gaffes of the night, with Trump quickly seizing on it.Toluse Olorunnipa, Yasmeen Abutaleb, Michael Birnbaum, Cleve R.

By midday Friday, many airlines said flights were starting to resume. Dutch airline KLM said before 11 a.m. that its flight disruptions had been “almost completely resolved.” Delta said it had resumed some flights and issued travel waivers to would-be passengers, which they could use to rebook their flights within the next several days. But United Airlines warned that “schedule disruptions may continue.”Delta has resumed some flights after a vendor technology issue impacting airlines and businesses globally. We’ve issued a travel waiver and customers can monitor and manage their itineraries on https://t.co/oAYy2BBlGo or the Fly Delta app. For more info: https://t.co/GSbpUNpU9dSecretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg posted Friday on X that officials are continuing to monitor the impact of the IT outages on transportation systems across the country.“Many flights are impacted as systems recover — passengers should check with their airline for updates and visit our website for more on passenger protections,” he wrote.Several hospitals and health systems around the world reported technology issues Friday, forcing some to pause procedures or encourage patients to stay home if they could.“Just about every major health system in the world is using some level of Microsoft product, and they’re getting that blue screen of death,” said Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a firm focused on digital risk to the health care sector. “I’ve not seen anything of this magnitude and impact in my career of 30 years.”Massachusetts General Hospital posted on X that “all previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits” were canceled Friday. Its emergency rooms remained open.In England, the National Health Service said the outage was causing issues with its patient record systems at general practitioner offices. “The NHS has long standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP,” it wrote in a statement. Seattle Children’s Hospital closed its outpatient clinics Friday, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said it was pausing the start of procedures with anesthesia.

In a statement to The Washington Post, United said it was restoring its Friday schedule after a “major” software disruption that affected systems used for calculating aircraft weight, check-in services and call support centers.
Customers were encouraged to change their travel plans on the airline website. Per a waiver issued, travelers can reschedule trips with no change fees or fare differences, as long as the ticket is for a United flight between July 18 and July 25 and is booked in the same cabin and between the same cities.
Delta
Delta has issued a travel waiver for all customers who have booked flights departing Friday. It allows customers to manage their own travel changes via delta.com and the Fly Delta app. The fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before July 24, in the same cabin of service as originally booked. If travel is rebooked after July 24, any difference in fare between the original ticket and the new ticket will be collected at the time of booking. Customers can monitor and manage their itineraries on Delta.com or on the Fly Delta app.
American
While American Airlines reestablished their operations by 5 a.m. Friday, per an X post, customers scheduled to fly from or to certain airports, including DCA, can have their change fees waived if they travel between July 18 and 25.

Southwest
Southwest told The Post in a statement that the outage “did not directly affect our operations.” Travelers reported delays Friday morning, but there are no travel advisories or notice of waivers on Southwest’s website or app related to the outage.
Frontier
Frontier wrote on X Thursday night: “During this time booking, check-in, access to your boarding pass, and some flights may be impacted.” In a subsequent post, they referred affected customers to the airline’s travel advisory page.
Frontier customers whose flights were delayed over three hours, or canceled, are eligible for rebooking on the next available flight for no extra charge, or cancellations for full airline credit or full refunds to the original form of payment, per the page. Customers affected are not eligible, however, for hotel, ground transportation vouchers, meals or other accommodations, as the airline says online since the “event was beyond Frontier’s control.”
Spirit
In a social media post Friday morning, Spirit said due to the outage, they are “currently unable to rebook Guests whose travel plans have been disrupted.” Travelers whose flights were impacted were told to wait until service was restored for guidance.
JetBlue
In an email statement to The Washington Post, JetBlue said their operations remain normal, without any systemwide cancellations or delays.

Next in line were Chicago O’Hare (nearly 200 cancellations), LaGuardia (over 30 percent of outgoing flights delayed) and Minneapolis-Saint Paul (over 150 cancellations).
Internationally, Amsterdam Schiphol had more than 40 percent of outgoing and incoming flights delayed, and Berlin-Brandenburg had almost a third of departing flights canceled.According to FlightAware, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was the most affected by the outage.

Passengers who are caught up in Friday’s travel woes should also be entitled to meal vouchers or hotel accommodations, depending on how long they’re stuck due to delays or cancellations. The DOT’s customer service dashboard at FlightRights.gov spells out what airlines have promised to do for passengers in case of “controllable” delays. The department confirmed that Friday’s outage-related cancellations and delays are considered controllable.
All major airlines, for example, will rebook passengers on the same airline and provide meals or vouchers if passengers are waiting three hours or more. All but Frontier promise hotel accommodations and transportation to a hotel in case passengers are stranded overnight. Several airlines will rebook passengers on a partner carrier if needed.
Passengers who expect to ask for reimbursement should keep all their boarding passes and receipts to help move claims along, Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of air passenger rights company AirHelp, said in a statement.Fliers who don’t travel due to a significant delay or cancellation are entitled to a prompt refund, but will need to request one on airline websites; a new rule that forces airlines to refund travelers automatically will not go into effect until later this year.Passengers who are caught up in Friday’s travel woes should also be entitled to meal vouchers or hotel accommodations, depending on how long they’re stuck due to delays or cancellations.

Especially in a time of mass delays, it is a good idea for you to do as much as you can yourself.
If you have more complex needs, travel experts say it’s a good idea to try to get in touch with a real person over the phone. “Especially for the American companies, for the most part, the agents are good. They will help you,” said Eric Hrubant, founder and president of CIRE Travel. Hrubant said that while you will probably be at “the mercy of the callback” — and may have to wait up to an hour or more for help — agents at U.S. airlines often prove very helpful.
Be aware that airline customer service lines can be quickly overburdened. According to Lida Behnam of D.C.-based travel agency Lida Travel, it can be difficult for customers to get in touch with a live representative at any time of the year, but especially during widespread problems like an outage.
If you’re only looking for basic services or answers — like what seat or terminal you have — it can be a good idea to use chatbots or in-app support.
As a traveler, you can also try DMing the airline on social media platforms like X, where it’s more likely you can be connected with a representative faster.On Friday, airlines affected by delays from the outage recommended travelers keep up to date with delays and change their flights directly on websites or apps.

Hrubant, of CIRE Travel, said he always starts by Googling his flight number and inputting it into the website FlightAware.
“There,” he said, “you can see where your plane exactly is,” including when it lands, when it’s supposed to leave and where your specific plane is on a map.
You should also be sure to frequently check the app for your specific airline. Experts recommend linking your email and phone number to your reservation so you get updates straight to your phone.
“Airlines are pretty good at sending alerts,” Benham said. “If anything, they send too many.”
It’s important to remember that even if after tracking and checking in on your flight it looks like it’s delayed, that can always change. Getting to the airport on time regardless of apparent delays can be the difference between making or missing a flight.
“Don’t dilly-dally, because believe it or not, flights will get ‘undelayed’ or will move up … and if you’re still at your house, you will be in trouble,” Hrubant said.If you’re not sure whether your flight is delayed, proactively tracking your plane and route can be a good idea.Hrubant, of CIRE Travel, said he always starts by Googling his flight number and inputting it into the website FlightAware.“There,” he said, “you can see where your plane exactly is,” including when it lands, when it’s supposed to leave and where your specific plane is on a map.You should also be sure to frequently check the app for your specific airline.

InsureMyTrip CEO Suzanne Morrow said in a statement that travelers should hold on to receipts and bills for all their expenses, unused travel tickets and proof of payment for those tickets. They should also file a claim right away due to an anticipated high volume of requests using their insurance provider’s online portal.
Radchenko, of AirAdvisor, also said it’s worth checking to see if the credit card passengers used to book their flight comes with a travel insurance policy.

WaPo_133,Bangladesh imposes curfew after dozens killed in anti-government protests,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/19/bangladesh-demonstrations-police-hasina/,2024-07-20 03:03:02.964619,,"NEW DELHI — Bangladesh announced a nationwide curfew on Friday evening after clashes between police and various student groups killed dozens of people amid a violent backlash to a new policy to reserve a portion of government jobs for descendants of the nation’s freedom fighters.In the capital, Dhaka, protesters attacked the state television headquarters and set fire to police booths Thursday as they called for a “complete shutdown” of the country. Running street battles between security forces using rubber bullets and tear gas and crudely armed protesters forced life in several neighborhoods to a halt, with streets emptying of traffic and even the cabinet canceling its meetings, Bangladeshi media reported.More than 150 students were being treated at a Dhaka hospital for injuries after being hit by rubber bullets, Agence France-Presse reported. There were also reports of clashes between protesters agitating against the job quotas and the student wing of Hasina’s ruling party, the Awami League.Nayeemul Islam Khan, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told AFP on Friday that the military would also be deployed to enforce the curfew, which began immediately. Hasina has backed the new policy on government jobs.Schools and universities have been closed indefinitely before the curfew, and authorities have cut mobile internet services nationwide, citing the need to curb disinformation. NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, said live network data showed the country plunged into a near-total internet shutdown late Thursday. The websites for several leading Bangladeshi newspapers were either not updated since Thursday or altogether inaccessible. Television channels have also been taken off the air.As of late Thursday, before communications were fully severed, news outlets reported conflicting numbers of casualties, although most put the number of dead in the dozens. The leading newspaper, Prothom Alo, reported 29 killed and 1,500 injured Thursday, while AFP put the day’s death toll at 32, citing a police spokesman.The protests, which have simmered for weeks but ratcheted sharply in recent days, represent the most serious challenge to Hasina, 76, and her Awami League in years. Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, helped form the Awami League in 1949, which led the country’s bloody independence struggle against Pakistan in 1971. Hasina has argued that families who participated in the liberation war should be compensated with jobs, but her critics say the scheme unfairly benefits families close to the Awami League at a time of economic distress.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Although Hasina has been credited with boosting Bangladesh’s textile export industry and improving public infrastructure over her more than two decades in power, the country has recently been racked by inflation topping 9 percent and stagnant growth. Government positions are often seen as the most secure and coveted option by young jobseekers, but more than half of the slots are reserved for various groups, including residents in remote areas and women.The 30 percent quota for the descendants of freedom fighters existed until 2018, when it was canceled by the Hasina government amid violent protests. Last month, a Bangladeshi court reinstated the policy, and Hasina continued to argue in its favor.At a news conference Sunday, Hasina said she was open to lowering the quota but argued that some form of the policy should exist. She used a politically charged term — “razakar,” referring to the violent mobs that collaborated with the Pakistani army in 1971 — in a comment that reverberated around the country and led to student groups hitting the streets in anger.“Why do they have so much resentment toward the freedom fighters?” Hasina asked. “If the grandchildren of freedom fighters don’t get quota benefits, should the grandchildren of razakars get them?”Hasina has won every election since 2009, including several that have been criticized as unfair, and has come under criticism for her increasingly heavy-handed leadership style. In the run-up to the most recent election in January, her government jailed thousands of opposition figures and won unopposed after rival parties boycotted the polls.The Supreme Court has temporarily suspended the quota policy and said it would make a ruling on its legality on Aug. 7. During her last public appearance Wednesday, Hasina pleaded for “patience” and said she believed “our students will get justice from the court.”"

Within months, the General Assembly passed legislation granting him the power to pursue such cases and providing funding, beginning with $1 million in fiscal 2024.The civil rights division was launched in January and has begun investigating patterns of violations across the state, said Brown, who called his “justice and equity” agendas top priority.Brown’s office undertook the case against Sessoms in partnership with Maryland Legal Aid, which had been pursuing cases against Sessoms for other alleged tenant-rights violations and brought the sexual harassment claims to the civil rights division’s attention.Sessoms and his business, Mt. Vernon Group, operate at least 23 single family homes, many of which have been rented to women “at risk of imminent homelessness,” Friday’s complaint says. It details allegations by five women, including one who said Sessoms explicitly requested sexual acts from her in exchange for reduced rent.Sessoms exploited the woman’s “economic vulnerability and her need for housing,” the complaint says. She agreed to Sessoms’s advances to keep her home, the complaint says, but when she later rebuffed him, he retaliated by evicting her.The complaint, filed in Wicomico County Circuit Court, seeks a judge’s order prohibiting Sessoms from working as a residential landlord, among other relief.“Justice will be served, certainly, when we remove defendant Sessoms from this line of work,” as well as obtain restitution for the victims, Brown said.The suit asks for civil penalties and awards for damages exceeding $75,000.Civil rights violations can be reported to the Maryland Attorney General’s Office by email at civilrights@oag.state.md.us or by calling 410-576-6300."
WaPo_135,Nats’ Josiah Gray out for the season after partial UCL tear needs surgery,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/josiah-gray-injury-surgery/,2024-07-20 04:41:02.845041,,"Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray needs surgery to repair a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, the 26-year-old said Friday, a procedure that will end his 2024 season. Gray, who was an all-star for Washington last year, will likely miss a significant portion of the 2025 season as well.Gray landed on the injured list in April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm and had been working toward a return, but his rehab start with Class AAA Rochester on June 30 prompted a closer look. His velocity dipped and he allowed seven runs over three innings. Afterward, Washington shut him down and sought another opinion on his arm. “Obviously it will end the year and take away some of next year, but I’m going to fight tooth-and-nail to get back here as soon as possible and help these guys win some games,” Gray said.Gray is set to undergo surgery Wednesday, though he remained unsure whether he would have Tommy John, an internal brace procedure or a hybrid of the two — it depends on how significant the tear is. He plans to return to Washington to rehab afterward so he can remain around the team.“Obviously I can’t go out there and suit up and get strikeouts,” Gray said. “But I’ll hopefully be an encouraged as much as possible. I’m just grateful for that and grateful to be here.”Gray arrived in Washington in 2021 as part of the trade for ace Max Scherzer and star shortstop Trea Turner. After a 2022 campaign in which he allowed an MLB-worst 38 home runs and walked a National League-leading 66 batters, Gray took a step forward in 2023.   He pitched to a 3.91 ERA and earned his first all-star appearance, though he struggled in the second half. Manager Dave Martinez showed his confidence in Gray this spring, though, and named him Opening Day starter.Gray made two starts this season, posting a 14.04 ERA over 8⅓ innings. He hit the injured list in mid-April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm. Gray made five rehab starts in June and after the fourth — an outing where he allowed one run over six innings — Gray seemed poised to join the big league rotation again. Then came his fifth start, which didn’t go as expected.“I felt like I was oh-so close to getting back here in this clubhouse and contributing to wins,” Gray said. “Unfortunately, hit the hardest setback of all.”Gray has already talked with some of his fellow pitchers within the Nationals organization as well as Andrew Jackson, who was previously part of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization with Gray and now plays in Japan. All helped give him a positive mind-set  as he looked ahead. “Honestly I’m at peace with it,” Gray said. “I’ve understood that a lot of people have setbacks in their careers and unfortunately mine is this year, 2024. I want to come back stronger and better for it.”"
WaPo_136,She smiled. And that was enough.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/she-smiled-that-was-enough/,2024-07-20 04:36:02.845041,,"Melania Trump smiled. And smiled. And smiled.She appeared in Milwaukee at the Fiserv Forum on the final night of the Republican National Convention and didn’t utter a single public word. She wore a bright red Dior suit, tailored with precision. Her long hair was streaked with golden highlights. She glided down her makeshift runway and she offered the cheering crowd a wave. A perfectly calibrated smile spread across her face. That was enough for the crowd, for the moment and, perhaps, for the future.Perhaps her refusal to step into the character of the eagerly supportive spouse, the one who takes to the microphones to tell warmhearted stories about the candidate’s home life, his foibles and his eccentricities, will let other political spouses reject the role if that is their preference. But more importantly, perhaps it will allow the public — the voters — to dispense with the notion that the relationship between the people who live and love (or not) inside a marriage has anything to do with the relationship between a candidate and their constituents, between a candidate and their ego, between a candidate and their ambition.The former first lady chose not to speak at the convention. What could she possibly have told viewers about the man who has already served one term in the White House and is now in the midst of his third presidential campaign and who set a record for long-windedness with his 90-minute speech accepting this nomination? What could she say in the aftermath of an assassination attempt on her husband that she had not already put in a lengthy written statement on social media? What could she say to those who find Trump abrasive and narcissistic to convince them that they shouldn’t believe their eyes and ears and that knot in the pit of their stomach? And what more could she add to heighten his godlike status among his acolytes?The candidate’s granddaughter told the convention crowd that he was the sort of grandpa who called her at school just to chat and who gave her candy despite her parents rules against it. But that personal warmth doesn’t change the fact that Donald J. Trump — as the convention speakers insisted on calling him — refers to migrants and refugees as murderers and escapees from insane asylums. Donald J. Trump is also a man who denigrates and sexually assaults women. All these things are simultaneously true.Melania Trump has made it clear that she’s not the public’s conduit to understanding her husband’s aspirations and fears. She may well be intimately familiar with them, but she is no one’s interpreter or messenger.Perhaps this is a bit of wisdom helpful to Usha Vance, who took on the task of introducing her husband, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), before he accepted the nomination as Trump’s running mate. An accomplished lawyer, she walked onstage dressed in a cobalt blue dress and block heels. Usha Vance was restrained. She spoke slowly and quietly. Her audible intakes of breath suggested she was a bit nervous.She expressed her admiration for her husband and indicated that perhaps his beard was not her favorite characteristic. She recalled his curiosity and acceptance of their differences as they became friends. In her reminiscences of their time together at Yale Law School, J.D., as she called him, sounded like a genial, nonjudgmental man. Sen. Vance has characterized women seeking an abortion as murderers.The relationship between individuals, as they describe it, may tell you something about what those people think of each other: that they respect each other’s independence, that they revel in their contradictions. It gives little guidance on how a candidate deals with voters who they neither know individually nor have to engage with intimately and daily.Melania Trump has recused herself from litigating her husband’s case, as well as that of voters. She does not appear to be an unwilling participant in Trump’s political ambitions as much as a disinterested one. He rhapsodized about her in his speech: “I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful.”She had not rhapsodized about him in her letter. And that was fine. What would doing so have accomplished?Trump voters who claim uneasiness with his rhetoric or have concern with just how far-right he will go or how much of a dictator he aspires to be — just for one day? or two? or four years? — aren’t looking to Melania Trump for answers or clues. When she is present, she is part of the tableau. She is flowers on a stage.Historically, political wives have misled voters with words. They have actively prettied up dire circumstances. They've been enablers. Melania Trump is a reminder that voters are rarely deprived of vital information because a candidate’s spouse simply stands down, because they decline to speak on the office-seeker’s behalf. Jill Biden has told voters that the president is as sturdy and capable as he ever was. All the while, voters’ eyes and ears tell them just the opposite. Some argue that a candidate’s spouse is the person who knows them best. But often the vision of a spouse is clouded by time, familiarity and emotion. Sometimes, the best view is the fresh one. Sometimes, the most revealing picture is the one taken from a distance, one filled with context and the unruly and clarifying clutter of daily life.It may be that the most eloquent and honest thing for a spouse to do is remain silent, and let a candidate’s words and images tell voters everything they need to know."
WaPo_137,New judge in Young Thug trial signals testimony could resume next month,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/young-thug-trial-new-judge/,2024-07-20 04:32:02.845041,,"ATLANTA — An Atlanta-area judge appointed this week to take over the criminal racketeering and gang conspiracy trial of rapper Young Thug signaled Friday she hopes to resume testimony in the case next month but acknowledged she first needs to consider defense motions for a mistrial that could still halt proceedings.In a 90-minute status hearing with attorneys in the case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Paige Reese Whitaker said she hopes to bring jurors back on Aug. 5, at the earliest — nearly two months since they last heard testimony in the case. She repeatedly warned both prosecutors and the defense that she didn’t want to waste any time getting the proceedings back on track.But Whitaker also nodded to defense attorneys who are pushing to scrap the existing trial and start again — motions that she plans to take up in a series of hearings later this month to tackle all pending issues over the trial, witnesses and evidence before she orders the jury to return to work.“I would like for us to, if we’re going to be moving forward with this case, to be able to move forward with it and have all of whatever this is going to be out of the way,” Whitaker said.In what was her first appearance on the bench since being assigned to the case Wednesday, Whitaker repeatedly suggested that if the trial does proceed, it will move at a brisker pace than before, emphasizing the need to be “efficient” and to stop “wasting” the jury’s time.“I mean, this case has been going on for how long?” Whitaker said at one point, with a laugh.The answer is 18 months and counting, making this the longest-running criminal trial in Georgia history.Whitaker was assigned to the case two days after Judge Ural Glanville, who had presided over the case for two years, was removed mid-trial amid complaints he and prosecutors held an improper meeting with a key prosecution witness.She was the third judge tapped to take on the case. The matter was originally transferred Monday to Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram, but she abruptly recused on Wednesday, pointing to an earlier drama in the case in which her courtroom deputy was accused of having a romantic relationship with one of Young Thug’s co-defendants.The deputy was later fired and arrested, and the co-defendant, Christian Eppinger, saw his case severed from Young Thug’s. But Ingram said in a written order the possibility that her former deputy could be called as a witness in the case could “undermine the public’s confidence in the impartiality of the proceedings” because of their former connection.Whitaker is a former Fulton County prosecutor who also previously worked for the Georgia attorney general’s office. She was appointed to the bench by then-Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) in 2017 and has twice been reelected to full four-year terms.There had been some speculation about whether Whitaker would remain on a case that has been riddled with endless drama since the rapper’s arrest more than two years ago. On Wednesday, word circulated that several attorneys involved in the case, including Young Thug’s lawyer Brian Steel, had sponsored a fundraiser for Whitaker’s 2022 reelection campaign. But prosecutors have not raised any objections.The case has been slow-moving with jury selection that dragged on for 10 months, weeks-long breaks in testimony and other delays. Eight months after opening statements, prosecutors were only halfway through their witness list of more than 200 people when Glanville abruptly halted proceedings on July 1 in response to defense motions that he recuse. The jury last heard testimony on June 17.Several attorneys involved in the case as well as outside legal experts have questioned the impact of that long break and whether jurors have been able to avoid coverage about the disruption in the case, which has been major news in Atlanta.Steel has filed numerous motions for a mistrial, and he and other attorneys have renewed those motions in recent days. Late Thursday, Steel again filed a motion to remove Adriane Love, an assistant Fulton County district attorney who is leading the case, and another prosecutor who were in last month’s secret meeting with Glanville and Kenneth Copeland, a former Young Thug associate and key witness.In a motion last week, Steel gave notice that he plans to call Glanville and Love as defense witnesses to question them under oath about the meeting with Copeland and any other private meetings related to the case that he says defendants should have been privy to.An immediate question is whether Whitaker will proceed with the current jury and continue with the case or start over — as some defense attorneys have argued, citing issues with Glanville’s handling of the proceedings. If the trial is further delayed, Steel and other attorneys are expected to press for their clients to be released on bond — a move that is likely to be vigorously opposed by prosecutors.In the hearing Friday, which was not attended by Young Thug or any of his co-defendants, Whitaker asked all of the attorneys to introduce themselves and to inform her about their pending motions as she seeks to quickly get up to speed on the case.She declined to take up any of the “substantive” issues, including the motions for mistrial, pushing consideration of those requests to a series of hearings beginning July 30 when she said she wants the attorneys to “litigate” any remaining conflicts that could delay the proceedings if they ultimately resume.Some defense attorneys are seeking to have Whitaker revisit some of Glanville’s past rulings, including on evidence, but she suggested Friday she is not inclined to look back — a move that could be fodder for the defense as they seek to halt proceedings.“Obviously, I’m parachuting in, and I’m just going to have to pick up from that. I am not going to go back,” Whitaker said. “I cannot go back and reconsider every evidentiary ruling that’s already been made.”While she postponed major decisions in the case, Whitaker strongly signaled she plans to run the courtroom far differently than Glanville, who was known for rarely starting court on time. Whitaker, who began Friday’s hearing two minutes early, admonished attorneys that court would begin each scheduled day at 8:45 a.m. and that she would not put up with tardiness. She also lectured the parties on eating in the courtroom. “We’re not at a movie. We’re not going to be eating popcorn,” she said.In what seemed to be an order directed at Young Thug, who often attends court in elaborate outfits, Whitaker ordered defense attorneys to clean out courthouse closets where their clients’ trial attire was being stored, saying their wardrobe had grown too unwieldy. “We shouldn’t have 20 outfits for everybody,” she said.Whitaker also banned Young Thug and his co-defendants from using headphones to listen to music during proceedings. When a defense attorney told her they’d been doing that to combat “boredom” in the courtroom, Whitaker smiled, and replied, “Well, we won’t be bored from here on out.”The Young Thug prosecution is one of two high-profile criminal racketeering cases being led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis (D). Last summer, the veteran prosecutor brought charges against former president Donald Trump and more than a dozen of his associates, alleging that they criminally conspired to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss in Georgia.That case is now frozen, as Trump and others appeal a judge’s decision to allow Willis to continue prosecuting the case amid complaints that she had an improper romantic relationship with the former lead prosecutor she appointed to the case. There have been growing concerns among supporters of Willis that the Young Thug case might also be derailed, providing more ammunition to her political critics in a year where she’s seeking reelection as Fulton County’s top prosecutor.Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams, and 27 associates were charged in May 2022 as part of a sweeping grand jury indictment that alleged the rapper and his co-defendants were members of a violent criminal street gang in Atlanta.Prosecutors have alleged Young Thug was head of the gang, known as YSL, or Young Slime Life, and have charged him with criminal racketeering, gang conspiracy, and drug and weapons charges, while others were charged with other violent crimes, including murder and attempted armed robbery.Young Thug’s attorneys have contended that YSL is merely a record label and have attacked prosecutors for introducing Young Thug’s lyrics as evidence at trial, arguing that his rhymes were merely artistic expression, not literal recountings of criminal acts.The rapper is standing trial with five co-defendants, after others had their cases severed. All have pleaded not guilty.On Friday, Whitaker suggested to both prosecutors and defense attorneys that they might use the weeks before the jury returns to reconsider plea offers. “That might be fruitful,” she said."

But once again the iconic character’s parent company is saying she’s no feline.“Hello Kitty is not a cat,” Jill Cook, the director of retail business development at Sanrio, told the “Today” show Thursday ahead of the brand’s 50th anniversary celebrations. “She’s actually a little girl born and raised in the suburbs of London. She has a mom and dad and a twin sister Mimmy — who is also her best friend.”The character has a boyfriend and has her own pet cat, named Charmmy Kitty.“So if shes a little girl, how come her head is cat shaped?” one commenter wrote on YouTube.That sentiment was found across social media platforms as fans expressed playful disbelief.“I can’t believe I’m being gaslit into thinking that’s not a cat. It’s a cat and it’s been a cat all my childhood,” a person wrote on X. On the same thread, someone else wrote, “That’s like saying Peppa Pig is not a pig but a girl.”On Facebook, users would not accept that Hello Kitty isn’t a feline, even going so far as to call it “blasphemy.”“You can’t change our minds this late in the game. She’s a cat. Keropi is a frog ... and so on,” one person wrote on Thursday. Then another person said, “I don’t care what anyone says. You’re not stealing my childhood. That’s it the END!”Despite fans’ surprise, this week was not the first time Hello Kitty was identified as a human child.Anthropologist and Hello Kitty expert Christine R. Yano told the Los Angeles Times in 2014, “She’s a cartoon character. She is a little girl. … She’s never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature.”Back then, social media users were also stunned. “The world is crumbling before my eyes,” wrote one person.Hello Kitty’s British, human storyline originates from the mid-1970s, when Sanrio, the Japanese toymaker, promoted her to Japanese women who admired Britain.According to the company, her real name is Kitty White and she was born on Nov. 1 in the London suburbs. She is a third-grader who enjoys making new friends, traveling and eating cookies.Unlike many popular characters, Hello Kitty didn’t originate from a television show, movie or comic book. Her image started appearing on products in 1974, and her massive audience has grown since. The company says her trademark character is on about 50,000 products sold across 130 countries.Singer Katy Perry has a tattoo of Hello Kitty on a finger. There’s been a Hello Kitty float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for several years. Fans can visit the Hello Kitty Land theme park in Tokyo. This weekend, Van Leeuwen Ice Cream is releasing a limited-edition Hello Kitty ice cream flavor, to coincide with National Ice Cream Day on Sunday.Last month, at a state banquet speech celebrating Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako’s visit to Buckingham Palace, King Charles gave Hello Kitty a special birthday greeting.“Raised in a London suburb with her twin sister, a self-made entrepreneur worth billions of dollars, and a UNICEF Children’s Ambassador on top of all that,” the royal said. “So I can only wish a very happy birthday to … Hello Kitty!”Despite the uproar over Hello Kitty’s identity, Cook, the director at Sanrio, said her purpose has remained the same for half a century: “Her core message is friendship, kindness and inclusivity.”"
WaPo_139,"Biden wants government to stop buying soda bottles, other single-use plastics",https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/07/19/single-use-plastic-pollution-biden/,2024-07-20 04:02:02.845041,,"The Biden administration Friday announced a commitment to phase out single-use plastics across the federal government, marking a significant step in tackling the growing plastic pollution crisis.As part of an expanded strategy to combat plastic pollution in the United States, the administration set a goal to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.The federal government is the largest buyer of consumer goods in the world and this action could “significantly impact the supply” of these ubiquitous plastic products, according to an 83-page report detailing the administration’s plan. The administration also wants tougher regulations on plastics manufacturers, a source of greenhouse gas emissions. The report highlights that more than 90 percent of plastic is made from fossil fuels.By leveraging the federal government’s purchasing power, the administration hopes its latest effort will help reduce air pollution, protect public health and shift markets toward more sustainable plastic alternatives.“Tackling plastic pollution and its associated impacts will require unprecedented action at every stage of the plastic life cycle — from reining in the pollution from petrochemical production … to reorienting infrastructure to ensure dramatic increases in recycling and reuse,” wrote Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Ali Zaidi, White House National Climate Adviser, in a letter attached to the report.The move to reduce plastic use domestically comes as the world is grappling with how to manage the staggering plastic waste problem.Upward of 460 million metric tons of plastic are produced every year, equivalent to the weight of more than 300,000 blue whales, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Much of the plastic that becomes waste are single-use products that can end up polluting land, waterways and oceans. As the hardy material breaks down in the environment, it creates microplastics — tiny particles smaller than five millimeters that have been found everywhere from Antarctic snow to inside human bodies.The Biden administration’s new report “so clearly lays out the severity and urgency of this crisis for our oceans, for our climate and for our communities,” said Anja Brandon, associate director of U.S. plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit group.“The fact that it calls for comprehensive action throughout the full life cycle of plastics is a new recognition that we can’t solve this crisis without taking upstream action to reduce the amount of plastics we’re making and using in the first place,” Brandon said.She added that the federal government’s commitment to phase out single-use plastics is a “monumental” step.“When they throw their weight behind something, we know they can significantly shift the market,” she said.Biden’s commitments, however, come with a caveat. If former president Donald Trump returns to office following the election in November, it is widely anticipated that his administration would roll back a number of existing environmental and climate rules.Some environmental advocates emphasized the need for action and implementation following Friday’s announcement.“While commitments are important, the ‘how’ is essential,” Erin Simon, vice president and head of plastic waste and business at World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. She noted that the new report “provides the strategic analysis needed to meet these goals.”“We’re heartened to see this report doesn’t shy away from the negative impacts that plastics have on human health and analyzes the problem through the full life cycle of plastic,” Simon said. “Cleaning up the global plastic mess must start at home. And today under President Biden and Vice President Harris’ leadership, the U.S. government is doing exactly that. The world is watching; now is the time for bold commitments and concrete action on plastic.”Representatives from oil and petrochemical industries did not immediately respond on Friday to the report."

But campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday that Biden is “absolutely” staying in the presidential race, calling him the “best person to take on Donald Trump.” The efforts come as the Republican ticket hits the campaign trail, with former president Donald Trump and his new running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), planning an appearance together at a rally in Michigan on Saturday. Biden continues to isolate in Delaware after testing positive for the coronavirus."
WaPo_141,Biden donor Reid Hoffman splits with top adviser over strategic differences,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/hoffman-mehlhorn-biden-trump/,2024-07-20 05:59:02.903464,,"LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, one of the Biden campaign’s biggest donors, is separating from his chief political strategist, Dmitri Mehlhorn, after both men apologized publicly for comments before and after the assassination attempt of President Trump, the two announced Friday in a note.Mehlhorn said he plans to work with a smaller group of donors on projects with the Lincoln Project, a sometimes controversial group of political strategists opposed to the reelection of Donald Trump.The announcement was made after a 3 p.m. call with top Democratic donors, including Hoffman’s network, and featured an appearance by Vice President Harris. Investing in US, a donor network co-founded by Hoffman and Mehlhorn, will continue its work with Hoffman under the direction of other members of its leadership team, the statements said.“I firmly believe that Trump is an existential threat to democracy and rule of law, and I am more committed than ever to preventing a second Trump term,” Hoffman said in his statement. “I wish Dmitri success in his next efforts, and expect that his new initiatives complement our efforts and amplify our impact as we work in our different lanes to preserve America’s future.”Mehlhorn said in his note that the split was required because his work had begun to alienate people involved in Hoffman’s orbit.“Our venture approach requires us to work with a political ecosystem that often is alienated by my strategic assessments. As our portfolio has evolved and integrated into the anti-Trump ecosystem, my views have become more of a distraction. Over the past month, the tension has become too great to sustain,” Mehlhorn wrote. “With this I hope to be clear that I speak for myself and Reid speaks for Reid, and we will both be explicit if we agree.”Hoffman has remained a vocal supporter of Biden in the weeks after his disastrous debate performance last month in Atlanta. Mehlhorn has been an even more outspoken defender of Biden’s continued campaign, appearing last week at an online debate with New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg to make the case for Biden’s candidacy.Mehlhorn sent an email Saturday night to allies after the attempted assassination Saturday of former president Donald Trump that asked others to consider the possibility that the event might have been “staged.” He later apologized.“Last night, I sent an email I now regret. I drafted and sent it without consulting my team,” he said of that email in a statement. “I have apologized to them directly. I also want to apologize publicly, without reservation, for allowing my words to distract from last night’s central fact: political violence took yet another innocent American life.”Hoffman also clarified remarks he made before the assassination attempt at a business conference with investor Peter Thiel, who has supported Trump in the past. At the event, Thiel described the decision by Hoffman and Mehlhorn to fund a successful civil libel lawsuit against Trump by E. Jean Carrol was “turning a clown into a martyr,” Hoffman said.“In that context, I replied that I wished that Trump would martyr himself — meaning let himself be held accountable — for his assaults on and lies about women,” Hoffman said in a July 14 post on X. “Of course I meant nothing about any sort of physical harm or violence, which I categorically deplore.”“I am horrified and saddened by what happened to former president Trump and wish him a speedy recovery,” Hoffman added.Carroll won her suit against Trump after a New York Jury found that the former president had sexually abused Carroll in a New York department store and later defamed her when she spoke about it.Investing in US, under Mehlhorn’s leadership, has been known for an entrepreneurial and adventurous approach to political spending.The group, with Hoffman’s backing, has funded a wide variety of efforts to help Democrats and hurt Trump, including the funding of niche online news sources in the hopes of mobilizing voters and recently backed a set of groups aimed at creating parties, giveaways and other cultural events in the hopes of increasing voter turnout among young people in major metropolitan areas."
WaPo_142,"In the 1970s, a poetry prize changed with the times",https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/19/national-book-awards-1970s/,2024-07-20 05:39:02.903464,,"The National Book Awards will celebrate its 75th anniversary at this year’s ceremony, on Nov. 20. To mark the occasion, The Washington Post has collaborated with the administrator and presenter of the awards, the National Book Foundation, to commission a series of essays by National Book Award-honored authors who will consider (and reconsider), decade by decade, the books that were recognized and those that were overlooked; the preoccupations of authors, readers and the publishing industry through time; the power and subjectivity of judges and of awards; and the lasting importance of books to our culture, from the 1950s to the present day. In this essay, Carl Phillips — a four-time finalist for the poetry award — looks back at the 1970s.I’ve often said that being a poet means leaving a record of what it meant and felt like to have lived in a human body for a particular time on Earth. The fact that no one person can represent all of the human condition means there’s a need for as many voices as possible, to provide an accurate history of a given period. But the history of poetry, in this country at least, was for so long marked by a narrowness of definition — basically the poetics represented by the White male English canon — and by a narrowness of “suitable” content, reflective of a Puritanism that has never entirely gone away from life in the United States: no sexual candor, therefore, no racial unrest, no room for voices that might question the status quo by demanding inclusion, by refusing silence.When I agreed to write about the 1970s National Book Awards in poetry, I fully expected to see a list of straight White male winners, with perhaps a token nod to the historically marginalized here and there. Yes, the 1970s came right on the heels of the Stonewall riots, the women’s liberation movement and the civil rights movement, but I assumed the White male poets would close ranks in response, rather than admitting “outsiders.” I am surprised, and gratified, to be wrong about this. Just as these movements reshaped the music scene and the visual arts, they asserted their influence on poetry as well; and though the judges for the National Book Awards in poetry remained largely male and White during this time, the lists of finalists they arrived at suggest at least an awareness of the need to evolve.Only three straight White men won the award for poetry in the 1970s: A.R. Ammons, Richard Eberhart and Howard Nemerov. To my surprise, eight queer poets, most of them openly queer, won the award: Allen Ginsberg and Adrienne Rich (who tied in 1974), Marilyn Hacker, John Ashbery, James Merrill, Elizabeth Bishop, and Howard Moss and Frank O’Hara (another tie, in 1972). There’s a fair representation of queerness among the decade’s finalists as well: Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, May Swenson and Robert Hayden.I’m interested, too, in how the range of poetic strategies within this group seems an accurate reflection of the range of what it can mean to be queer. Bishop and Hayden, for example, never really spoke openly of queerness in their poetry, nor did they seek to overthrow the canon. I have argued elsewhere that Hayden’s braiding of English prosody with Black history (in poems like “Middle Passage”) was its own political gesture, but a quiet, somewhat academic gesture. Hayden and Bishop, in their poems at least, were more closeted compared with the decidedly iconoclastic O’Hara, Ginsberg and Rich, each of those three not only open in terms of content but formally restless, in search of a free verse that might accommodate queerness without necessarily being exclusive to it, ever in pursuit of what Rich called “the dream of a common language.” And then there are writers like Hacker and Merrill, almost exclusively formal poets — but unlike Hayden’s and Bishop’s, their content was unabashedly queer. Their poems didn’t express a desire to smash the system but insisted on being honestly oneself within it; which is to say that they forced the system to accommodate their queerness.Another welcome surprise to me was the number of Black poets represented. There were eight instances of Black finalists: Hayden (twice), Lorde, Walker, Ishmael Reed, Sherley Williams, Carolyn Rodgers and Michael Harper. It wasn’t until 1999, though, 49 years after the prize was first given, that a Black poet (Ai) won the award. (It was 33 years between the first Pulitzers and the first Black winner in any category, poet Gwendolyn Brooks.) Is it too easy — or just accurate — to say this seems reflective of American society’s continued grudging acceptance of Black people at the proverbial table, coupled with an instinctive resistance to letting us sit and eat there on equal terms? Is it? Either way, I remain impressed with the representation — it does reflect the decade’s political changes in race relations; indeed, given how narrow the canon had been for so long, it feels radical.The first two winners of the poetry award in the 1970s were women: Bishop and Mona Van Duyn, with Hacker and Rich winning later in the decade, and women consistently appeared among the finalists. Two low points, however, were in 1972, when there were 11 finalists for the award but no women, and again in 1973, with no women among 12 finalists. My first assumption was that the judges must all have been men, but in 1972 Swenson was one of five judges, and in 1973 Muriel Rukeyser and Helen Vendler were among the five. But having served as the single Black judge for this award in 2005, a year when no Black finalists appeared on the list, I know that being a judge doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a particular poet onto the list; and there’s also the quandary about responsibility/expectation: Must being a woman, for example, mean that you insist on a book by a woman? Does it mean your favorite book that year can’t have been by a man? Is aesthetic diversity as valid a form of diversity as racial and sexual diversity, as I asserted at the time, though I thought even then that I was hoping to justify what I felt — and still feel — was a failure of our committee to reflect not just the range of poetry that year but the varieties of people in this country?It is impossible for any list of books (even 11 or 12 of them!) to represent all aspects of a nation as diverse and populous as ours. At the same time, when I bring all the poetry lists of the 1970s together, I can’t deny that a considerable diversity is represented in terms of race, gender, sexual orientation, social class and poetics. The lists suggest a country grown restless with inequality, ambivalent about war and not yet clear as to how to reconcile a sometimes reluctantly admitted need for change with an understandable fear that to evolve from tradition might mean losing that tradition forever. If, given the subjective nature of art and individual taste, I’m not always in agreement with which book won in certain years, I can also honestly say that each winning book represents excellence; that’s rare, I find, when studying the history of a prize.There are omissions, of course. The largely California-based Language poets, like Lyn Hejinian and Susan Howe, who resisted a lyric model that embraced narrative, clear argument, resolution and the poetic line as understood for centuries — none of them appear here, unsurprisingly, since the judges in this decade are pretty much unanimous in their allegiance to that same model. Meanwhile, though Black writers appear, there’s an unignorable absence of writers of Latin, Indigenous and Asian backgrounds.It is easy, though, to criticize a lack of enlightenment from the hindsight of what we consider our more enlightened selves — who’s to say what readers in 50 years will think of who we are right now? The National Book Awards in poetry for the 1970s show more openness than I expected. It is likewise easy in hindsight to call out errors, or at least to imagine that things might or should have gone otherwise. Nevertheless, I’ll conclude by doing that very thing. It seems a shame that Robert Hayden never won the National Book Award, though I acknowledge his being a finalist both in 1972 and 1979 (just months before he died). Hayden was famously criticized by the leaders of the Black Arts Movement, most notably Amiri Baraka, for not turning from the traditions of T.S. Eliot to a more populist, race-conscious and “accessible” form of poetry. At the same time, while the mostly White critics acknowledged Hayden — in large part because he worked within a poetics they shared — his insistence on showcasing Black history may well have given these same critics pause; too political for them, yet not political enough for Baraka? Hayden was easily among the finest poets writing in English in the 20th century, one whose work has already in the decades since shown more stamina, more lasting power, than many of the other names that appear on the lists from this decade.But the National Book Awards aren’t intended as predictions of what will be read in the future. They represent what appealed in a given year to a select group of human beings, each one fallible, fickle and absolutely an individual. It seems an achievement, ultimately, that to read the books represented in the 1970s is to have an incomplete but nevertheless not inaccurate sense of the richness and variety of American poetry at the time. I can sense a country beginning to reckon with its many selves more seriously than it has before, because now it has to.Carl Phillips is a poet, critic and translator. His 17 books of poetry include four finalists for the National Book Award and “Then the War: And Selected Poems, 2007-2020,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2023."
WaPo_143,Nats’ Josiah Gray out for season after partial UCL tear that needs surgery,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/josiah-gray-injury-surgery/,2024-07-20 05:00:02.903464,,"Washington Nationals right-hander Josiah Gray needs surgery to repair a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament, the 26-year-old said Friday, a procedure that will end his 2024 season. Gray, who was an all-star for Washington last year, probably will miss a significant portion of the 2025 season as well.Gray landed on the injured list in April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm and had been working toward a return, but his rehab start with Class AAA Rochester on June 30 prompted a closer look. His velocity dipped, and he allowed seven runs over three innings. Afterward, the Nationals shut him down and sought another opinion on his arm.“Obviously it will end the year and take away some of next year, but I’m going to fight tooth and nail to get back here as soon as possible and help these guys win some games,” Gray said.Gray is set to undergo surgery Wednesday, though he remained unsure whether he would have Tommy John, an internal brace procedure or a hybrid of the two — it depends on how significant the tear is. He plans to rehab in Washington so he can remain around the team.“Obviously I can’t go out there and suit up and get strikeouts,” Gray said. “But I’ll hopefully be an encourager as much as possible. I’m just grateful for that and grateful to be here.”Gray joined the Nationals in 2021 as part of the trade package for ace Max Scherzer and star shortstop Trea Turner. After a 2022 campaign in which he allowed an MLB-worst 38 home runs and walked a National League-leading 66 batters, Gray took a step forward in 2023.   He pitched to a 3.91 ERA and earned his first all-star appearance, though he struggled in the second half. Manager Dave Martinez showed his confidence in Gray this spring, naming him Washington’s Opening Day starter.Gray made two starts this season, posting a 14.04 ERA over 8⅓ innings. He hit the injured list in mid-April with a strained right flexor muscle near his forearm. Gray made five rehab starts in June, and after the fourth — an outing in which he allowed one run over six innings — Gray seemed poised to join the big league rotation again. Then came his fifth start, which didn’t go as expected.“I felt like I was oh, so close to getting back here in this clubhouse and contributing to wins,” Gray said. “Unfortunately, hit the hardest setback of all.”Gray already has talked with some of his fellow pitchers in the Nationals organization as well as Andre Jackson, who was previously part of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization with Gray and now plays in Japan. They helped give him a positive mind-set.“Honestly, I’m at peace with it,” Gray said. “I’ve understood that a lot of people have setbacks in their careers, and unfortunately mine is this year, 2024. I want to come back stronger and better for it.”"

But campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday that Biden is “absolutely” staying in the presidential race, calling him the “best person to take on Donald Trump.” The efforts come as the Republican ticket hits the campaign trail, with former president Donald Trump and his new running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), planning an appearance together at a rally in Michigan on Saturday. Biden continues to isolate in Delaware after testing positive for the coronavirus."
WaPo_145,A fatal program update: How CrowdStrike crashed global computer systems,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/19/bosd-outage-microsoft-crowdstrike/,2024-07-20 05:03:02.903464,,"A botched update from one of the world’s preeminent software security companies wreaked more havoc on global business in one day than all but the very worst of hacking groups have ever managed to inflict.CrowdStrike built its name and a more than $70 billion market value by catching and publicly identifying malicious electronic campaigns by Russian and Chinese spies and organized criminal gangs that take in hundreds of millions of dollars.But the company depends on deep access to millions of computers to defend them against new attacks, and instructions CrowdStrike sent to those machines running Microsoft’s Windows operating system overnight rendered them useless by Friday morning.As banking, airline and 911 emergency call systems struggled to recover, CrowdStrike apologized and blamed an error rather than a hacking attack on its internal systems.“This was not a cyberattack,” CrowdStrike said on its blog. The Austin-based company said it identified the problem and provided a fix for customers to help their employees get working again.Yet the failure was so extensive and its impact so profound that not all security experts were convinced it was merely human error. CrowdStrike has grown rapidly in the last year and just last month joined the S&P 500 index of top publicly traded companies. But it has made worldwide enemies by calling out hacking operations such as those by Russian intelligence that stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair in 2016.“I doubt this was accidental. Too many shortcomings,” said Matthew Hickey, founder of Hacker House training company. He said the offending file contained random data, had not been digitally signed and had not been adequately tested.A U.S. federal official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters said there was no evidence of sabotage or foreign involvement.Stories to keep you informed

Social anxiety can be limiting. There are ways to get relief.Some analysts said they were waiting to hear more from CrowdStrike and that the complexity of state-of-the-art hacking defenses made them dangerously fragile.Jake Williams, a onetime hacker for the National Security Agency, said “endpoint detection” products like CrowdStrike’s Falcon tool often send out not just updated identifiers for malicious programs to block but also lines of active code to foil more complicated attack scenarios. He said it was possible that CrowdStrike’s systems for testing code before installing it everywhere might not have been “sufficiently diverse” to catch the mistake.While computer network outages aren’t unusual, experts were stunned Friday that one company’s error rippled through so many systems.“We haven’t seen a cascading failure like this — maybe ever,” said Chuck Herrin, an executive with the digital security firm F5 Inc.The sheer extent of the tech crashes around the world Friday exposed the risks inherent in the sort of security software that many see as essential for businesses to ward off ransomware and other devastating hacks.To be effective, such programs need to be able to see everything that is happening on a machine. But that access can make their failure catastrophic, as it was Friday, and the fix the company later provided was complex: Many organizations had to manually reboot each machine one at a time and delete the bad update file.That privileged access also makes security programs a top target for spies and ordinary hackers. Just last month, U.S. officials banned Russian anti-virus software company Kaspersky Lab from new business in the country, after it was accused of playing a role in the theft of secrets from NSA employees and others.Friday’s problems canceled or delayed thousands of flights and forced hospitals to postpone operations. The worst cyberattacks, such as the Russian NotPetya assault on Ukrainian businesses and the North Korean WannaCry virus, have done more lasting damage by permanently damaging computers. But not even those spread so rapidly and so far.The extent of the financial damage from the outages, as well as who will bear those costs, will not be known for some time. Most software providers are free from legal liability for the harm caused by their programs, which are licensed instead of being sold. But they typically have service agreements with their largest customers that could require help with remediation, discounts or other compensation.The failure at CrowdStrike is striking in part because the company’s executives have been among the industry’s most prominent voices faulting Microsoft for repeated security lapses. The software giant was blamed for recent major intrusions at U.S. agencies, including the theft of email last year from officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. A scathing April report by the Cyber Safety Review Board, which is led by an official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, cited “corporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.”Beyond those lapses at Microsoft, CrowdStrike has said that company’s dominant market position in operating systems and productivity software imparts any weakness with a potentially catastrophic impact.As one of the few top security companies, some experts are now saying the same about CrowdStrike, one of a small set of network security companies with such broad reach and power.“Obviously this is very serious, it’s going to be weeks. You have to get hands on keyboards,” said Bryan Palma, chief executive of rival security company Trellix. “This speaks to the need for redundancy and defense in depth.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it was helping with recovery efforts and warned that criminals pretending to be from CrowdStrike were trying to talk customers into downloading malicious programs or giving up access to their computers.Marie Vasek, an assistant professor at University College London’s computer science department, said the widespread computer meltdowns showed how reliant global technology systems are on a small number of companies’ software, including that of Microsoft and CrowdStrike.“The issue here is that Microsoft is a standard bit of software that everybody uses, and the bug in CrowdStrike is deployed to every single system,” she said.Vasek said technology networks have become so sprawling, complex and interrelated that it increases the odds of one botched line of software code bringing down entire computer networks.This defect only affected computers that use Windows, which powers hundreds of millions of personal computers and many back-end systems for airlines, digital payment, emergency services, call centers and much more.In a statement, CrowdStrike said it is “working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.”Some companies affected by the CrowdStrike glitch, including banks and emergency service centers, said Friday that they had implemented CrowdStrike’s repaired software and were starting to recover.Vasek said both Microsoft and CrowdStrike need to examine their procedures to prevent a repeat of such widespread technology failures.She said CrowdStrike should consider how to safely update its software to many millions of computer networks. And Microsoft, she said, needed to do more to ensure that updates to software from other companies don’t cripple Windows machines.“Microsoft needs to think about how to check that software is as it should be,” she said.Microsoft didn’t directly address that criticism but said in a statement that the company is “actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.”The company had also reported outages with some of its popular web-connected software for corporate and government technology networks.It wasn’t immediately clear how many of Friday’s computer network collapses resulted from the defective CrowdStrike software update and which were the result of problems that started Thursday with Microsoft online services and its corporate cloud computing service, Azure.A spokesman for Microsoft said the company didn’t believe the CrowdStrike software bug was related to the outage that impacted a “subset of Azure customers.” It has been resolved, he said."
WaPo_146,"Friday heat was near July’s average, and cool by comparison",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/19/weather-summer-heat-dc-average/,2024-07-20 07:49:03.062297,,"Often extremes get all the attention, and the average is ignored. But Friday’s heat in the D.C. came close to average, and in such a month as this one, that seemed alluring.After four consecutive days of temperatures above 100 degrees, neither Thursday nor Friday even touched 90 in the District.That made them welcome, even if it did not make them uncommonly cool. Both days had highs of 89 degrees, which is obviously as close to 90 as can be without actually touching it.But even to seem to scorn a day in the 80s in July in the nation’s would appear to show meteorological ingratitude. July’s claims to thermal infamy do not rest solely with the four days of 101 degrees and higher.As a prelude to those notorious times, July can lay claim to nine other days with temperatures of 94 or greater.All this is to say that any excesses of enthusiasm for Friday (and Thursday) might seem pardonable, although each day reached the thermal pinnacle of the 80s.Friday’s 89, as was Thursday’s, was a single degree below the average daily high for the District at this time of year. So both of those days could be regarded as generic sorts of summer days, and they also seemed welcome for that.In addition, Friday was not without humidity, but it did not seem to be present in insufferable excess. The heat index, the feels-like temperature did not exceed the actual temperature.Just as the actual temperature never touched 90, the hourly heat index also remained below 90.It is not quite 30 days since the summer solstice, and the sun of Friday, July 19 was strong. Sometimes clouds, thick or thin, and often gray, shielded the city’s streets from the direct heat of the sun.But sometimes the unmitigated infrared energies of July sunshine beamed with full force on the District.It is a fact of summer life, that at such times, in the sunshine, it can feel far hotter than the 89-degree thermometer reading.As a result, seeking shade might seem an act of summer survival that is performed almost without thinking, in deference to innate instinct.But many streets for much of the day did have a shady side, which helped enhance the almost exhilarating sensation of comparative comfort provided by high temperatures only in the 80s.With their 89 degree highs, Friday and Thursday proved to be this month’s first two back-to-back days below 90 since July 2 and 3, when each day was 88.Those two early July days may be only dimly recalled across the searing stretch of time since then.That has made a day like Friday, though its maximum heat registered merely one degree below average, worthy of enshrinement as part of the still-being-created legend of this month."
WaPo_147,Afghanistan War Commission opens inquiry of America’s longest conflict,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/19/afghanistan-war-commission/,2024-07-20 07:31:03.062297,,"Against the backdrop of America’s roiling political landscape and two raging foreign wars, a coterie of former U.S. government officials and academics on Friday opened what will be an extensive examination of the United States’ 20-year foray in Afghanistan — the nation’s longest conflict.“Today we make history,” said Shamila N. Chaudhary, co-chair of the Afghanistan War Commission. “Never before has the United States commissioned such a wide-ranging independent legislative assessment of its own decision-making in the aftermath of a conflict.”The mission is daunting. The 16-member bipartisan panel has been tasked by Congress with determining what went wrong and what U.S. leaders could do differently the next time the United States goes to war. Their mandate encompasses policies and actions taken by four presidential administrations, the U.S. military, the State Department, U.S. allies, and many other agencies, organizations and people.The commission has 18 months to carry out its research and until August 2026 to deliver a final public report.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 ended the war, but delivered the country back into the hands of the Taliban, an enemy Washington spent trillions of dollars trying to vanquish beginning in the aftermath of 9/11. The bloody and chaotic exit resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and scores of Afghans; left thousands of American allies behind to an uncertain fate; triggered broad, bipartisan outrage; and gave rise to bitterly politicized congressional inquiries and hearings.The Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee is expected next month to deliver a final report detailing the findings of its investigation of the withdrawal. That inquiry has featured hours of heated and sometimes emotional testimony from Biden administration officials, military commanders, veterans and their families. The committee next week intends to interview Jen Psaki, President Biden’s White House press secretary at the time of the withdrawal.The war commission’s 4½-hour discussion Friday, held in the Washington headquarters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, featured former ambassadors, military officers and CIA personnel as witnesses. It drew a small crowd of observers, many of whom were also connected to the war.Chaudhary and her co-chair, Colin F. Jackson, a former Defense Department official, are cognizant of the charged atmosphere that surrounds their undertaking. The commission itself was borne of the collective outrage that followed the withdrawal three years ago.But they stressed that they seek a dialogue that is thoughtful and apolitical, even if commission members were handpicked by Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the heat of national anguish. “We are bipartisan in our composition, but our work is nonpartisan,” Chaudhary said.It’s hard to ignore the issue of blame, they concede. It “keeps coming up in our conversations,” Chaudhary told the panelists. People want to know if the commission will name and shame; if it will deliver some measure of justice by calling out the leaders who made the worst critical decisions in the war.The commission will try not to do that, while at the same time endeavoring to produce “a full, objective, rigorous, unvarnished and unflinching account of our performance as a government and a military,” Jackson said. “We owe it to the generation that served in Afghanistan, and the generation that will serve somewhere else.”It isn’t just an assessment of the war’s failures. The commission’s report will include guidance, they said: practical advice that could be applied to other wars the United States is involved in, such as those ongoing in the Middle East and Ukraine, or to wars that have yet to happen, but someday will.If the first hearing can serve as a guide for what commissioners are likely to conclude, it’s that so many different things went wrong.Consecutive administrations failed to address the critical role that Pakistan — an ostensible U.S. ally — played in sustaining and shielding the Taliban, said Nader Nadery, a witness who served as a senior Afghan government official. U.S. leaders also often prioritized short-term military goals over longer-term values, and sometimes employed rhetoric that undermined the Afghan government’s credibility, he said.There were convoluted chains of command throughout the war; disruptive personality clashes between American decision-makers and agencies; and commanding officers served tours of duty that were so short as to represent “the institutional equivalent of a frontal lobotomy,” said another witness, Ronald Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan and the author of “The Other War: Winning and Losing in Afghanistan” — published 11 years before the U.S. withdrawal.There was a terribly devised system for parliamentary elections that invited fraud, said Noah Coburn, a political anthropologist who provided testimony Friday. There was too much public meddling in Afghan politics by U.S. leaders, and too little policy input solicited from the Afghans. Poor U.S. decisions when it came to security partners, development and investments fueled corruption, which spread mistrust of the government and support for the anti-government Taliban, said Coburn. Civilian casualties, abusive warlords and poor security did that too.It’s not that no one was saying this during the war. Much has been written. Experts and documentation of on-the-ground events were ample as they were happening, commissioners and panelists acknowledged. But often, U.S. officials failed to absorb the information, and consecutive administrations failed to use that knowledge to change course.“A fair question,” Jackson, the co-chair, said, “is, but what decisions are you going to look at?”“The easy answer is we’re going to consider a much larger set of decisions than we can possibly cover in detail, and there will be a very difficult winnowing process,” he said.Among the obvious points of interest, Jackson said, will be the decision to invade Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The commission will examine the decision to surge U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009. They will look at the decision-making that went into negotiations with the Taliban. And of course, they will look at decisions related to the withdrawal.The commissioners acknowledged that their mandate has become vast — to cynics, perhaps, so ambitious as to be almost impossible. What started as a mission to understand and to educate is also partly an exercise in collective therapy, the commissioners said, an opportunity not just for government officials, but for the larger population, and particularly veterans, to come to terms with what happened.“For so many of us, the war still lingers in our minds. We carry the moral, physical and emotional injuries in our daily lives,” Chaudhary said. “Closure may not be possible for everyone.” But a space is needed for “civic discourse,” she added."
WaPo_148,These Maryland siblings were skeptical about summer camp. It won them over.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/20/summer-ymca-camp-letts/,2024-07-20 07:29:03.062297,,"Katie Garcia couldn’t believe it. Five nights in the woods, and no cellphone? How would she stay in touch with her boyfriend? What about her TikTok streak? Plus, it was going to be hot and there would be bugs.Her mom, Jessica, had just dropped off Katie, 13, and her brother Johann, 12, at Camp Letts in Edgewater, Md. It was an hour’s drive from their home in Silver Spring, but it may as well have been five hours. The kids had never been to sleepaway camp before, and they weren’t particularly excited to be there — especially after they learned of the camp’s no-phone policy.Jessica pulled her two kids into her arms.“This is going to be super fun,” she assured them.As they said goodbye, Katie looked at her mom with doe eyes. Please, Mom? she seemed to say.Johann grabbed her arm.“Let’s go Katie,” he said. “It’s a week.”Katie and Johann weren’t convinced they’d have any fun. Sitting together at check-in on the first day, they agreed that neither of them were particularly interested in trying to make friends.They already knew how hard it was to say goodbye. The kids had switched schools so many times that they had to count on their fingers keep track of how many they had attended.“I’m not going to cry, like I did this school year, ” Johann said.Katie lugged her suitcase up the stairs to a cabin tucked into the woods. She stretched a navy blue sheet over the thin mattress on the last available bottom bunk. Then she realized that she hadn’t packed a pillow.She didn’t know she’d need one.A counselor assured her they’d find one.Sticky summer air and an awkward silence filled the cabin as five 13-year-old girls sat in a circle making name cards for their bunks. Aside from the best friend duo who came to camp together, they were all strangers.There were first-time campers like Katie, and others who had been coming there for years.
“Wear lots of sunscreen,” a camp veteran advised. “And do all the waterfront activities.”
Katie listened as a counselor listed the activities: kayaking, archery, ziplining, paddleboarding, paintball, high ropes.
“High ropes?!” Katie’s face lit up. “Oh, that’s cool.”
Maybe, just maybe, that one part of camp could be fun.
That night, Katie and her cabin mates sat around an unlit firepit as counselors taught them team chants that they would use the rest of the week. The girls joined in hesitantly.Katie and Johann had never been away from home for longer than a few days. Camp Letts is run by the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington and offers scholarships through its “Send a Kid to Camp” program, which funded their trip.Despite their hesitation, Garcia thought it would be good for the kids to connect with nature and get out of the house for a bit. She wanted her kids to experience a cornerstone of American childhood: canoeing on the lake, singing around the campfire, making fast friends, crafting bracelets.Katie and Johann started every morning with paddleboarding, then swam in the pool, then headed back to the waterfront to kayak. They ate lunch, then played tennis and volleyball and other activities in the afternoon. At each meal, the cabin groups burst out into loud songs about being the best crew at camp, banging tables and stomping so hard the whole floor would shake.By the middle of the week, Katie was fitting in. She bragged about being the only girl in her cabin who didn’t fall off the Banana Boat, a rubber raft pulled by a motorboat. Her nails were stained purple from tie-dyeing T-shirts. As she walked to the pool, she rehearsed the camp songs she’d learned.She had even made friends, a lot of them. They bought matching bandannas at the camp store and planned to exchange phone numbers.On the last day, tears streamed down Johann’s cheeks as he said goodbye to his counselors and new friends. He and Katie wore matching Camp Letts T-shirts printed with the word “campsick” — a play on “homesick” — as they boarded the bus back to Silver Spring where their mom awaited them.Katie didn’t cry. But she said the week had surprised her.She may even go back next year for another five nights in the woods.Without a cellphone."
WaPo_149,"V. Craig Jordan, father of breast cancer drug tamoxifen, dies at 76",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/19/v-craig-jordan-breast-cancer/,2024-07-20 07:00:03.062297,,"V. Craig Jordan, a medical researcher who changed the course of cancer treatment — and helped save the lives of millions of women — with his discovery that the drug tamoxifen could stop and even prevent the development of breast cancer, died June 9 at his home in Houston. He was 76.His death was announced by the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston, where Dr. Jordan was a professor. He had renal cancer, his daughter Alexandra Noel said.Dr. Jordan, who grew up in England and held dual British and U.S. citizenship, once told an interviewer that he had “barely made it out of grade school” with his lackluster grades.Not reflected on those early report cards, however, was the curiosity, persistence and talent that would make him, in time, one of the most significant cancer researchers of the second half of the 20th century, one known as the “father of tamoxifen.”When Dr. Jordan began his research in the late 1960s, as a doctoral student at the University of Leeds in England, cancers deemed treatable were attacked in three principal ways: through surgery to remove tumors and through radiation and chemotherapy to kill cancer cells.Breast cancer patients had historically been subjected to radical, often disfiguring operations to remove the breast and surrounding tissue.Radiation opened new pathways for treatment but came with serious side effects. Chemotherapy, the latest development in oncological care, represented a revolution in medical science but was often brutal on the patient.“There was an obsession with the idea [that] combination chemotherapies were going to cure all cancers,” Dr. Jordan told the website Oncology Central in 2019.“It felt like we were trying to swim upstream,” he added, when he and his colleagues tried to push scientists to look beyond chemotherapy regimens, which mounted relatively indiscriminate attacks within the body, and to consider the possibilities of drugs targeted to specific cancer cells.Dr. Jordan demonstrated the potential of his idea in an unexpected way, on the anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen that began its pharmaceutical life as an experimental contraceptive.As a contraceptive, tamoxifen worked beautifully in rats. In women, it was a spectacular failure and “almost guaranteed,” Dr. Jordan said, “that the woman who took it would conceive a child.”“During the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the last thing you needed was everybody getting pregnant,” he told the Chicago Tribune in 1998.However, Dr. Jordan saw another use for tamoxifen and undertook further study. For years, it was understood that patients with some forms of breast cancer — those with estrogen receptors — responded favorably to the removal of their ovaries, which produce estrogen.An anti-estrogen drug, Dr. Jordan surmised, might have a similar positive effect. In 1973, he demonstrated that tamoxifen could prevent mammary cancer in rats.By the following year, human testing was underway in the United States. In 1977, the Food and Drug Administration approved tamoxifen for use in advanced cases of breast cancer.The following decade, it was approved for treatment of earlier-stage cancer in conjunction with surgery. And in 1998, the FDA approved tamoxifen for use in high-risk but still healthy patients to prevent the onset of the disease.After Dr. Jordan’s death, the Prevent Cancer Foundation credited him with discovering “the first FDA-approved drug to prevent cancer.”Tamoxifen carries risks, including, in some cases, the development of uterine cancer or blood clots. But it remains one of the most prescribed drugs in cancer treatment and ranks on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines.Tamoxifen is what is known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Other SERMs include raloxifene, another subject of Dr. Jordan’s work, which is used for the prevention of osteoporosis as well as breast cancer.Dr. Jordan was born Virgil Craig Johnson in New Braunfels, Tex., on July 25, 1947. His mother, who was British, and his biological father, who was from Dallas, met while his father was serving in the U.S. military in England during World War II.The couple had moved to Texas after the war but divorced when Craig, as Dr. Jordan was always known, was a toddler. He and his mother moved to England, where he grew up in Bramhall, near Manchester. He was raised by his mother and his stepfather, who adopted him, and who gave him the surname Jordan.Despite his poor academic performance, Dr. Jordan developed an early love for chemistry.“I converted my bedroom into a chemistry laboratory, but it was a real chemistry laboratory, not one of those kid’s kits, with the things I’d gotten from the pharmacy and liberated from school,” he recalled years later.“There were multiple life-threatening moments when my experiments exploded or caught fire, and I had to throw things out the window,” he continued. “But my mother would always say, ‘at least we know where he is.’”He ultimately enrolled at the University of Leeds, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1969 and a PhD in 1973, both in pharmacology, writing his doctoral dissertation on tamoxifen. The university awarded him a doctor of science degree in 1985.At the University of Leeds, Dr. Jordan joined the Officers’ Training Corps of the British army. He later served in the Intelligence Corps and the Special Air Service and remained for years in the reserve.In his scientific career, he worked at institutions including the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia and the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University Hospital before joining the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2014.Dr. Jordan’s marriages to Marion Williams, Monica Morrow and Julia Jauch ended in divorce. Survivors include two daughters from his first marriage, Alexandra Noel of Stillwater, Minn., and Helen Turner of Salt Lake City, and five grandchildren.As he became known as the “father” of a lifesaving breast cancer drug, Dr. Jordan regularly encountered people, he told the Houston Chronicle, who said to him, “My mother is on tamoxifen, my wife is on tamoxifen.”“Mothers have seen their children grow up,” he said. “Grandmothers have seen their grandchildren grow up.”"
WaPo_150,"At British Open, a mighty wind shoos Rory McIlroy and kisses Shane Lowry",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/19/british-open-shane-lowry-rory-mcilroy-troon/,2024-07-20 07:19:03.062297,,"TROON, Scotland — The way this British Open said cheerio to Rory McIlroy on Friday night felt either barbaric or puckish. It ushered him off with a dozen closing holes that verged on pristine, as if he should have brought along a dog and a leash and a small plastic bag of treats. It even found a place for his work of art from the bunker beside the No. 14 green, which plopped down and rolled in with a near-cruel obedience. By then and toward 8:25 p.m. when he finished, both the crowds and the wind had thinned. How absurd.Otherwise, this 152nd British Open kept acting like a classic British Open wind-wise, savaging many with scores that looked like many, and it nodded toward some wind veterans heading into the weekend: Irishman Shane Lowry leads at 7 under par, and Englishmen Justin Rose and major debutant Dan Brown are at 5 under after both came through the wilds of qualifying. Lowry, for one, won the 2019 British Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland as the wind sang, the skies brooded, the galleries boomed and the clouds wept heavily for joy. Scottie Scheffler, for another, lurks at 2 under with his six wins this year and his No. 1 ranking while hailing from a place prone to wind (Texas) and fielding a question about whether he thinks his name causes stress to other players by using his trademark level of bombast.“Not really,” he said.“I can’t wait to watch this weekend,” said McIlroy, whose triple-bogey 8 on No. 4 finished him off early, assured his major drought would reach 38 and made it the eighth time in that ludicrous span he has missed a major cut. Referring then to Lowry, he said: “He’s so creative. I think even just watching the coverage the last couple of days, that little sort of squeezy cut that he can hit, especially going out on that front nine, is going to be really helpful to him. Yeah, look, he relishes these conditions. The Open Championship is his favorite tournament in the world. He gets more up for this than anything else. I’m looking forward to cheering him on and hopefully him getting his second [claret] jug.”He won’t have to contend with any of the people who couldn’t contend with Troon’s earnest wind off the Firth of Clyde, which reached midafternoon levels ideal — for sailing. It kept pummeling people right off the bat or at least before the turn, sending them into vegetation and agitation. It often sent people looking through wilderness for golf balls as if on treasure hunts. It dispatched Tiger Woods pretty much by No. 2, when his tee shot veered through the gray sky way left to a botanical bonanza and the 77 he piled atop his 79 seemed booked. He double bogeyed there, missed his third straight major cut and made off for five months of looking forward to that father-son event in December he dubbed “our fifth major.”Justin Thomas, whose 68 on Thursday looked swell and contentious, slipped from third to 38th when his 78 featured this off-key chorus: bogeys on Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6; double bogey on No. 5; triple bogey on No. 9. His cobbling of a back-nine 33 after his front-nine 45 qualified as herculean. Robert MacIntyre, the 27-year-old Scot who just won the Scottish Open with ample exhilaration and told of ample beverages thereafter, went through the first four holes at 7-5-5-8, meaning two triple bogeys and 8 over. “That was carnage,” he said. He, too, did well to hold together a 75 to make the carnage cut of 6 over by a stroke. Sahith Theegala made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 6, Elvis Smylie made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, David Puig made a triple-bogey 8 on No. 4, and Angel Hidalgo made a quadruple-bogey 9 on No. 4.The front and the middle parts kicked the rear parts of a player the caliber of Wyndham Clark, 2023 U.S. Open champion and 2024 Olympian. He shot an 80, free-fell to 16 over and left. Japanese hopeful Aguri Iwasaki, 26, peppered his 91 with some numerals seldom seen in such highbrow events: consecutive 9s, a quintuple bogey on No. 13 and that rarely witnessed sextuple bogey on the par-3 No. 14, during which he had three bunker shots of four yards or shorter.“I suppose the thing you’ve got here, you’ve got three different sixes,” the great Padraig Harrington said of the course sequences. “You’ve got six downward going out or, as we played them, into the wind. Then you have six in the middle that are really awkward. They’re really tricky. There’s blind shots. There’s gorse.”At the famed Railway hole, No. 11, Lowry wound up making a double bogey but saying, “To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6.”Also within that stage of the course, Joaquin Niemann’s quintuple-bogey 8 at the wee par-3 Postage Stamp, No. 8, deserves a review. He went into a green-side bunker. He went across to another green-side bunker. He went zero yards and stayed in that green-side bunker. Then he went 27 yards to another green-side bunker.Question: “Then what was kind of going through your mind as you were going from …”Niemann: “Bunker to bunker?”Reporter: “Bunker to bunker.”Niemann: “Just get it out of there.”(Laughter.)In a similar fate in a different place, McIlroy’s second shot from the native area somewhere near No. 4 moved two yards to portend that big-old 8 there. It left him finished in his own realistic mind, marking the second major occasion of the year when “the wind got the better of me,” as he put it of the Friday at the Masters and the Thursday and Friday here. “Yeah, I think once I made the 8 on the fourth hole, that was it,” he said. “Twenty-two holes into the event” — an event in which he figured to contend — “and I’m thinking about where I’m going to go on vacation next week.” He called it “a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that.”The meaningful holes are left to Rose, the 2013 U.S. Open champion hoping for a big career autumn at 43, and to Brown, who said that after his opening-round lead, “I was knackered,” yet still shot a non-collapse 72. And they’re left to Lowry, who proved a grand front-runner at Portrush such that one observer asked whether the chasers should fret. “I don’t know,” the good-natured Lowry said, soon adding, “Honestly, I’m not sure Scottie Scheffler is too worried about anyone with the form he’s in.”And the meaningful holes in a different way are left to Max Homa. His 28-foot attempt to make the cut rolled past McIlroy as it traveled, and when it plunked in, Homa, who called it “an out-of-body experience,” hollered. “I didn’t really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament,” he said. It led to a typically gracious hug thereafter from McIlroy, who walked off with that slight frown so familiar on an evening nicer than it had a right to be."
WaPo_151,Politician accused of using fallen-officer donations for personal expenses,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/19/las-vegas-councilwoman-doj-indictment/,2024-07-20 07:00:03.062297,,"A former Las Vegas City Council member who ran to be Nevada’s governor is accused of soliciting more than $70,000 in donations to build a memorial to a slain police officer, then using the money to pay for her daughter’s wedding and other personal expenses, according to a federal indictment filed Tuesday.Michele Fiore (R), now a justice of the peace in Nye County, Nev., had promised donors that their entire contributions would go toward a statue dedicated to an officer killed in the line of duty, the Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday.But Fiore used the donations on rent, travel and political fundraising bills, federal prosecutors said. She also transferred money to family members, including to pay for the wedding, the department said. During her initial arraignment in a Las Vegas federal court Friday, Fiore, who was a council member during the alleged scheme, pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and four counts of wire fraud. If convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison on each count, according to prosecutors.In a brief news conference outside the courtroom, Fiore called the allegations “repugnant.”“I have served as a city councilwoman and a judge with integrity, honor and respect,” Fiore, 53, said Friday. “This indictment is a direct attack on my character. I look forward to learning the specifics of the accusations against me and addressing these horrible allegations head on.”Nancy Schreihans, a clerk for the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline, which investigates complaints against judges, said Wednesday that the organization is aware of the indictment but declined to comment further.Fiore, who is from New York, is a staunch Republican who became well-known in Nevada for her colorful brand of politics. She has defended gun rights, but also supported both same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana. In 2016, she received widespread attention for helping negotiate a resolution to a standoff between the FBI and anti-government occupiers in Oregon.While announcing her run for governor in 2021, Fiore released a contentious campaign ad that unveiled her “three-shot plan” of banning vaccine mandates, banning critical race theory and stopping voter fraud. In it, she drives into the desert in a pickup truck with a “Trump 2024” bumper sticker, unholsters her gun and shoots at three “Socialism”-branded beer bottles that read “vaccine mandates,” “CRT” and “voter fraud.”She left the race in 2022. That same year, she ran for state treasurer, but lost.The Las Vegas City Council in 2015 approved plans to create a park honoring Alyn Beck, a 41-year-old police officer killed in the line of duty the year before, according to the indictment. The plan was approved before Fiore was elected to the council.Beck — described by his family in his obituary as “arguably the toughest individual in the city of Las Vegas; but with the softest, kindest center” — and another officer were eating lunch at a restaurant in June 2014 when they were fatally shot, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. City police later told the Review-Journal that it was the first time two of its officers were killed in one incident.The council also later approved plans for a park in honor of the other officer, Igor Soldo.Fiore was elected to the Las Vegas City Council in 2017. The following year, the city broke ground on the Alyn Beck Memorial Park, funded by a private real estate development company, the indictment says. At the groundbreaking ceremony, Fiore allegedly proposed that a statue of Beck be installed at the park’s entrance.The next year, the same company — which is not named in the indictment — agreed to pay a sculptor to create and install the statue, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege that despite knowing about this agreement, Fiore solicited donations ostensibly for the statue between July 2019 and January 2020.She told certain donors, at least one of whom was a public official in Nevada, that if they wanted to contribute funds for the statue of Beck or another memorial for fallen officers, they could give money directly to her charity or her political action committee, the indictment alleges. She had created the PAC in 2017 and the charity, purportedly intended to raise money for services to the Las Vegas community, in 2019.The statue was unveiled Jan. 31, 2020, the indictment states. But none of the money Fiore had solicited until then had been used on it, prosecutors said Wednesday.Fiore said in a statement the same day that she had first learned of the indictment from news outlets and called it “unacceptable.”“This indictment has been years in the making and has profoundly impacted my life, the lives of my adult children and grandchildren, my friends, and especially my constituents,” she wrote. “Now that I have been accused, I eagerly await my opportunity to address these charges in court.”On Friday, standing next to her attorney outside the courtroom, Fiore briefly addressed reporters and promised to “stick to the script — because for you that are familiar with me, when I go off script, I get in trouble.” She then read a statement railing against what she called “the shadow games others have played for the past decade.”“No weapon formed against me will ever prosper,” Fiore said, concluding her remarks. As she walked away, the gaggle of reporters began shouting a chorus of “Did you take the money?”Their questions went unanswered.A pretrial conference was set for Sept. 9, with a tentative trial date of Sept. 24."
WaPo_152,"Twelve more Democrats, including two senators, call on Biden to drop out",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/19/democrats-biden-withdraw-clash/,2024-07-20 07:09:03.062297,,"REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. — Two senators were among a flood of at least a dozen Democrats who called on President Biden to drop out of the presidential race Friday — the largest single-day wave of lawmakers asking him to step aside since his disastrous debate performance last month.Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Martin Heinrich (N.M.) and 10 House members on Friday added their names to the rapidly growing list of Democrats worried that Biden was on track to lose the election to Republican nominee Donald Trump. But the president’s campaign reiterated in no uncertain terms that he would be staying put.The tense standoff between the president and his party set up a pivotal clash that is expected to intensify this weekend and could reach its culmination next week. The increasingly intense impasse between supporters and skeptics of the president suggests there is no end in sight to the Democratic infighting that has surrounded Biden’s candidacy as both sides have grown more dug-in and willing to allow the standoff to play out in public.“I think the President should end his campaign,” Brown said in a statement Friday. Heinrich, hailing from a traditionally Democratic state aides fear has suddenly become competitive, called on Biden to “step aside” for the good of the country.The president’s aides remained defiant in the face of the biggest threat to his candidacy so far.“He’s not going anywhere,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” saying the president was “absolutely’ committed to continuing his campaign. She called him the “best person to take on Donald Trump” and suggested that the growing angst among top Democrats about Biden’s candidacy does not reflect the broader sentiment across the party.Less than two hours after O’Malley Dillon’s appearance, four House Democrats released a joint statement calling on Biden to “pass the torch,” the broadest collective effort from Congress thus far — and a move some officials said was representative of a larger, growing groundswell against Biden among lawmakers that could erupt into view if Biden does not step aside over the weekend. By the end of the day, the 12 additional Democratic lawmakers who called on Biden to step aside Friday marked the highest total of any day since such calls began July 2.“We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,” Reps. Jared Huffman (Calif.), Marc Veasey (Tex.), Jesús “Chuy” García (Ill.) and Mark Pocan (Wis.) told Biden in the joint statement.The push highlighted an unmistakably ramped-up push in Congress to oust the president from the ticket. Lawmakers including Reps. Gabe Vasquez (N.M.), Betty McCollum (Minn.), Zoe Lofgren (Calif.) and Morgan McGarvey (Ky.) added their names to a fast-growing list. The total number of congressional Democrats urging the president to bow out has now risen past 35, more than 12 percent of all Democrats in Congress.It is clear the diverse group of Democratic stakeholders are seeing this moment very differently. Some people close to Biden are urging Democrats to give him the time and space to end his candidacy on his own, to end his half-century of political life with grace. Other Democrats say they have spent weeks giving the president every opportunity to leave with dignity on his own terms, only to see them all rebuffed.Yet others are fully backing the president’s continued candidacy. O’Malley Dillon has told campaign aides privately that recent reports that Biden is considering imminently dropping out of the race are far removed from reality, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Top White House adviser Anita Dunn has echoed that sentiment, giving some campaign aides confidence that Biden remains committed to being the Democratic nominee even as he appears to be losing the confidence of significant portions of his party.Yet the pressure to push Biden aside was only intensifying Friday ahead of what some officials described as a crucial weekend, given that the Democratic National Convention is a month away — and the party is planning a virtual nominating process sooner to lock in the nominee.That has fostered a “now or never” mood on Capitol Hill, with multiple lawmakers discussing a public effort to oust Biden from the race. A new Political Action Committee called Pass the Torch announced Friday that it was launching ads in Washington and Rehoboth Beach, Del., urging Biden to end his reelection bid. A group of Democratic delegates gathered via Zoom on Friday to discuss how an open convention would work.All the while, Biden remained behind closed doors at his home in Rehoboth Beach, where he is self-isolating after testing positive earlier this week for the coronavirus and experiencing mild symptoms. In a statement Friday, Biden said he planned to return to the campaign trail next week.“The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” Biden said in the statement, a response to Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday. “Together, we will win.”Biden’s doctor said Friday that the president continues to experience a loose cough and hoarseness, though his vital signs are normal and his symptoms have improved. Meanwhile, his political standing appears to be worsening. In a sign that Biden is planning to move forward with his bid for a second term, he plans to join comedian David Letterman for a July 29 fundraiser at the home of Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a according to a person familiar with the planning. Yahoo News reported the planned fundraiser earlier.The makeup of the four lawmakers behind Friday’s joint statement is significant, since they are all members of larger groups that have expressed support for Biden. Pocan is the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which has largely stuck with Biden. Garcia is a member of the Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising arm endorsed Biden on Friday. Veasey is a member of the Black Caucus, whose leadership has also stood with the president.“Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign,” they wrote.Both Huffman and Veasey directly raised concerns to the president about his ability to win during separate calls that lawmakers held with Biden last weekend.Heinrich suggested Biden could not win against Trump. “The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy,” he said. “We must defeat him in November, and we need a candidate who can do that.”Heinrich is running for reelection in New Mexico, a state that Biden won by 11 points in 2020, but aides say the presidential race is tied in the state.More lawmakers are expected to follow suit in coming days, as polls appear to be solidifying with Biden trailing Trump in important battleground states. That would create the spectacle of a party torn apart and publicly at war with its leader, but a growing number of Democrats are concluding there could be little alternative.“There’s been a gradual shift — it may be accelerating somewhat — with a few more obviously, speaking publicly, and a good number privately,” said one senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with colleagues and the White House. “I think also the mood in the White House or the campaign also seems to be shifting somewhat, so I think the two trends are complementary.”But, publicly, Biden’s team is showing no sign of shifting.On Friday, Biden campaign aides pointed to support the president had received from key figures including liberal lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). During a lengthy Instagram Live session Thursday night, Ocasio-Cortez told supporters that ousting Biden would lead to chaos and harm the party’s chances of defeating Trump. Sanders, speaking on “Morning Joe” offered a full-throated endorsement of Biden, saying the president could help Democrats win “in a big way.”Campaign officials said they were planning multiple press events and volunteer events in the coming days, aiming to showcase that Biden’s candidacy was forging ahead.The campaign also touted Friday’s endorsement of Biden by BOLD PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The group said in a statement that Biden and Vice President Harris “have delivered for the Latino community.”But not all members of the PAC or the Hispanic Caucus are supportive of Biden remaining at the top of the Democratic ticket. Reps. Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Garcia (Ill.) and Mike Levin (Calif.) are among House Democrats who have called for the president to leave the race. The group had agreed to endorse Biden before Biden’s debate performance on June 27, which rocked the president’s candidacy after he struggled to complete his sentences, according to multiple people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.Members of BOLD PAC, which includes a majority of Hispanic Democrats in Congress, were only alerted shortly before the release went out.More House Democrats are in discussions about how and when to publicly call on Biden to step down. Some believe there is no need to participate in sinking an already waterlogged ship, others want to give Biden the weekend and still more, like the four who jointly spoke out Friday, believe it is important to keep up the pressure.In the Senate, a group of Democrats is also discussing whether to come forward as a group to call on Biden to step aside. They are also discussing the timing — whether to do it after the weekend or sooner, according to three people familiar with the discussions.The mood among Democratic senators has shifted against Biden’s candidacy just in the last few days, according to multiple senior aides. Last week, Democratic senators were divided. But as new polling has shown that states he easily won in 2020, including New Mexico and Virginia, are now essentially tied, Democrats are increasingly fearing they could lose if Biden heads the ticket.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is in a tough reelection in a conservative state, added his name to the calls to withdraw on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and his lieutenants spent the week continuing to hear from concerned members. They have not warned members against coming out against Biden, as they did in the days immediately after the debate. Instead, they are telling their colleagues to do what is best for their campaigns.Jeffries told reporters Friday he was continuing to support Biden as “our nominee,” though his remarks were little changed from previous public comments, in which he has suggested the president needs to make a decision about his candidacy.Some in the president’s orbit suggest the mounting pressure campaign is counterproductive.“Message to everyone trying to affect the president’s decision about whether to pass the torch: GIVE JOE BIDEN THE SPACE & TIME TO PROCEED AT HIS OWN PACE.” Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School who has spoken to Biden since the debate, wrote on X on Friday. “Stop pressuring the man. He has earned the right to your respect.”The debate over Biden’s candidacy became even more tense in the aftermath of the Republican National Convention, which ended with a lengthy, meandering and at times dark speech by Trump. The display convinced several Democratic officials that Trump could be beaten if the party has the right candidate.“Donald Trump’s dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans,” Biden said in a statement after the speech. “Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.”Many in the party remain unconvinced. The 30-second ads by Pass the Torch feature Democratic voters in Pennsylvania urging Biden to step aside. Delegates Are Democracy, another newly formed group, held a Zoom for delegates to the Democratic National Convention to inform them how an open primary would work if Biden were to step aside.Elaine Kamarck, an expert on presidential nominations and a member of the Democratic National Committee, told the gathered delegates that if Biden were to bow out of the race, the road to an open convention could be fast-moving and “fascinating.”“Basically, think of it as a redo of the primary system in a very, very, very compressed period of time,” she said.Caldwell reported from Washington and Sotomayor from Milwaukee. Amy B Wang and Mariana Alfaro in Washington contributed to this report."

Earlier on Friday, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Biden is “absolutely” staying in the presidential race, calling him the “best person to take on Donald Trump.” The efforts come as the Republican ticket hits the campaign trail, with former president Donald Trump and his new running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), planning an appearance together at a rally in Michigan on Saturday. Biden continues to isolate in Delaware after testing positive for the coronavirus."
WaPo_154,What’s to blame for the CrowdStrike mess? Our drive for efficiency.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-outage-big-tech-efficiency/,2024-07-20 07:00:03.062297,,"I’m willing to bet that, until Friday morning, most people had never heard of CrowdStrike, an Austin-based cybersecurity firm. Only after the company pushed a bad update onto Windows computers, creating the biggest IT disaster in history, did most of us realize how much our lives depend on it. Or how difficult it might be to fix the problem.It’s natural to ask how the heck this could have happened, and how we can make sure it never does again. But another question needs to come first: How much might we be willing to sacrifice to protect against the risk?At the moment, this might seem absurd. To people stranded by canceled flights or missing doctor’s appointments, it’s worth spending almost anything to avert the chaos that has beset airlines, hospitals, first responders and other critical services. But this is like saying it’s worth insuring your car to the absolute maximum — after you’ve gotten into a big accident. Many car owners decide not to buy the most generous possible coverage because that coverage also carries higher premiums.So, too, with maximally insuring against meltdowns like the CrowdStrike mess, because doing so would require paying a price in economic efficiency. So we have to decide what trade-offs we’re willing to make.Averting this particular disaster might not have cost a ton of money, to be clear. But CrowdStrike is only one of approximately one zillion points of possible failure in our thoroughly networked and globalized economy. Over the past 50 years, the market’s relentless drive for efficiency and reach has made such mass failure nodes more numerous, more potentially catastrophic and harder to see before they fail — while also giving us instant access to all the world’s culture and most of its information, plus more, cheaper and better goods and services, and a global economy that every year lifts tens of millions more people out of poverty.I came of age in the 1990s, when this transformation was still in its comparatively early days. The internet was just beginning, and global trade was shifting manufacturing from the United States to countries that had cost advantages (such as China and Mexico) and countries that had special technical expertise (such as Germany and Japan).At the same time, Americans were importing foreign techniques such as “just-in-time” manufacturing, which replaced inefficient local suppliers and mountains of spare parts with far-flung but streamlined supply chains that delivered inputs precisely when they were needed. This was often hard on people who worked for the local industries. But it was a boon to workers in poor countries and to American consumers. Compare any consumer product today with its 1990 equivalent, and you’ll often find that either the quality has risen dramatically (cars) or the price has fallen precipitously (clothes). In the case of televisions and many other products, it’s both.The internet intensified this trend, because its network effects and economies of scale often drive markets toward a handful of players. This newspaper, for example, used to be one of thousands of local newspapers, each competing for readership within a geographically limited market. Now we’re vying to be among a handful of daily news publications that serve the entire country, maybe even the entire English-speaking world.Enlarging markets, and putting more eggs in fewer baskets has real benefits: A few big news publications can cover more beats, more deeply, than a lot of small ones can. But it also has real downsides, such as a higher risk that those few players will all miss some stories — notably, local news — or get one of them badly wrong. Similarly, as became obvious during the pandemic, cost-efficient just-in-time global supply chains can leave companies and their customers vulnerable when borders slam shut and governments hoard critical resources for their own citizens.In the case of software companies, it’s quite efficient for one firm to serve a large number of important customers, as CrowdStrike does — or even practically all the customers, as is the case with online search. In some ways, these concentrated players might provide greater reliability, because they develop a lot of expertise by serving many users, and they can invest more in R&D and security than Bob’s Friendly Local Software Co. can. But when outages happen, they happen to seemingly everyone, everywhere, all at once, leaving users no alternatives.How best to try to manage the trade-off between efficiency and redundancy is a hard question for another day. For the moment, the important thing is to recognize that it exists, and that there’s no easy way around it. We probably should have thought more about such trade-offs when the Great Efficiency Drive was underway. We’ll have to think even harder about them now."

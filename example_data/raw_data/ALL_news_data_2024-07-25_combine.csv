NBC_1,Democrats who want to run against Harris for nomination have only days to get in the race,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-want-run-harris-nomination-only-days-get-race-rcna163298,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"Any Democrat wishing to challenge Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidential nomination has only days to secure the necessary support, according to the party's nominating rules approved Wednesday, which laid out plans for an unusual pre-convention nominating vote scheduled for early next month. 
Candidates have until Saturday to declare their candidacy and until  Tuesday to gather the needed support from hundreds of delegates to make the ballot alongside Harris at the virtual roll call vote. Democrats have given themselves an Aug. 7 deadline to conduct the roll call to avoid potential legal issues.
“We understand that this is an unprecedented situation, but we will accomplish it together,” said Minyon Moore, a veteran Democratic strategist and Harris ally who is chairperson of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.
No major Democrat has even hinted at plans to run against Harris, who has quickly consolidated support in the days since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her. 
The compressed timeline is also affecting Harris’ search for a vice presidential running mate, which may need to be completed in just two weeks. 
More than three-quarters of pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention have already endorsed Harris, according to an NBC News tally as of Wednesday afternoon, with no obvious pockets of opposition from any parts of Democrats’ vastly diverse coalition. 
But Democrats are eager to avoid making their nomination process look like a coronation for Harris, promising an open and fair process. All it takes for someone else to run is the signature from at least 300 delegates (with no more than 50 from any one state) to have a chance at making the nomination ballot. 
The timeline is incredibly restricted because Democrats have, for months, been planning to nominate their candidate early to avoid potential legal issues around an Aug. 7 ballot access deadline in Ohio. The Republican-controlled state legislature passed a fix to move the date back, but the fix won't go into effect until September. 
Ohio’s Republican secretary of state says the new law resolved the deadline issue entirely. But Democrats do not trust him and fear litigation from outside conservative groups. 
“Failure to certify both nominees in advance of each state’s ballot deadlines opens us to very real potential litigation,” Pat Moore, a lawyer for the Democratic Party, said during Wednesday’s meeting of the Convention’s Rules Committee. “Republicans will use this moment to do what they do, to sue, to try to bar us from the ballot or try to disqualify our voters.”
Trump’s campaign has already filed one legal complaint claiming the handover of Biden’s campaign to Harris is illegal. The conservative Heritage Foundation is actively seeking plaintiffs in Ohio. And top Republican lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Johnson have said he expects litigation to try to trip up Democrats.
Democrats say they feel confident they can win a legal fight if they formally nominate their candidate after Aug. 7, but worry about creating a precedent Republicans could use to try to undermine the outcome of the November election. 
“If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republicans could make the same argument to challenge Democratic votes in the post-election process too,” Moore said. 
The basics of the virtual roll call process have been outlined since May, but had to be revisited after Biden stepped aside in favor of Harris. 
The roughly 200 members of the Convention’s Rules Committee met virtually Wednesday to consider the details of the virtual roll call plan and its timing and voted to officially adopt it.
Under the plan, the window for other candidates to declare their bid for the Democratic nomination starts Thursday and closes Saturday at 6 pm ET. Candidates then have until Tuesday at 6 pm ET to meet the 300-signature threshold of support from delegates, which represents about 6% of all delegates to the convention.
Rules Committee co-Chair Leah Daughtry said that threshold, which has been in place since the 1990s, represents a “serious but modest” level of support — ensuring candidates have broad support within the party without making the barrier too difficult to meet.
If Harris is the only candidate in the race, delegates will start voting in the virtual roll call Aug. 1. If there are multiple candidates, the party will allow “several days” for the candidates to make their cases to the delegates and public, but voting would still begin Aug. 3.Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News.

NBC_2,Senate Democrats say Mark Kelly would be a 'superb' VP pick. But there's some anxiety.,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/senate-democrats-say-mark-kelly-superb-vp-pick-anxiety-rcna163220,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"WASHINGTON — Numerous Democratic senators are heaping praise on Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris — but the prospect of his seat being vacated is stoking some anxiety.
“He’d be superb,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the party’s vice presidential nominee in 2016.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Kelly has “enormous depth and wisdom” as well as “real common sense” and an ability to grasp “very complex” issues quickly.
But some in the party are nervous about the idea of him leaving the Senate, fearing a Republican would win a special election in Arizona to finish his current term that expires in 2028. It's a factor some Democrats say should be weighed since the party has such a small majority and risks losing control of the chamber. 
“Kelly has got a lot of appeal as a candidate, but unproven as a national campaigner. And yes, he has a valuable seat,” said a Democratic official who has worked with Harris in the past.
The official added that Harris, who was a senator for four years, could add a different skill set to the ticket by picking a governor, which “might be a good compliment to her.”
Kelly, who sources have confirmed is being vetted by Harris' team, won in Arizona in a 2020 special election, outperforming President Joe Biden that year. He won again in 2022 for a six-year term. If he ascends to the vice presidency, Arizona’s Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs could appoint a successor but it could trigger a special election and put the seat up for grabs before his term ends in 2028.
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, called Kelly “savvy,” saying he has “the right values” and is “one of the most unflappable people I’ve ever met.” But, he said, protecting his seat is also a consideration.
“This is a calculation that the vice president and her team have to make. And that’s certainly a factor. But there are trade-offs no matter who you pick,” Schatz said. “So we’ve just got to, I think, first and foremost, she’s got to decide who she’s comfortable being a partner with.”
Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said Kelly is one of several contenders who could be Harris’s running mate.
“The considerations she has to take into account are, first of all, winning the election. And so looking at states where the race is really in play, and also alignment of values and the issues. I think there’s several people who fill that role,” Baldwin said. “Certainly my colleague Mark Kelly would, but there’s a lot of other names that I’m seeing too.”
Kelly has cultivated a reputation in the Senate as a center-left pragmatist who has been a reliable vote for most administration priorities while keeping his distance from the most progressive issues and staying attuned to local issues like water conservation.
One issue that has rankled organized labor is that Kelly is a rare Democrat who hasn’t cosponsored the PRO Act, a high priority for unions that has 49 official signatories in the Senate.
“Senator Kelly would vote for the PRO Act on the Senate floor,” Kelly spokesperson Jacob Peters said Tuesday.
Kelly declined to discuss the possibility of being Harris' running mate, instead responding to questions by lauding the vice president and not outright refusing.
“Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee. That is clear. She’s the right person for this job. And I’m gonna work really hard to make sure we don’t see Donald Trump back in the White House,” he said.
Kelly told NBC News that Arizona is “absolutely winnable” for Harris, “without a doubt."" Asked whether it would help her to have an Arizonan on the ticket, Kelly responded, “It’s not about me. This is about making sure Donald Trump isn’t in the White House again.”
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has also been floated as a possible running mate, said he hasn’t received vetting materials from the Harris campaign. Asked if he’d be interested, Murphy said, “I think she’s got a good list of people that she’s interested in right now.”
Some fellow Democrats who represent battle ground states added glowing praise for Kelly.
“I love Sen. Kelly, respect Sen. Kelly — naval aviator, combat veteran space shuttle commander, United States senator,” said Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. “I can’t speak to the vice president’s process. I’m sure she’s gonna make a strong choice. Sen. Kelly is an American hero and absolutely worthy of that consideration.”
A Senate Democratic aide said losing Kelly’s seat is “obviously a concern” but that keeping Trump out of the White House should be the single most important consideration for Harris.
“She should pick whoever she thinks she can work and campaign with the most effectively,” said the aide, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the issue publicly. “To stop Trump, you put out your starters. You don’t worry about the risk of an injury.”Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.

NBC_3,Credit card delinquency rates hit a nearly 12-year high,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-delinquency-rates-hit-nearly-12-year-high-rcna163466,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"People are struggling to pay off their credit card debt even as many trim their spending.
The share of credit card balances that are past due reached the highest level ever in the first quarter, according to data the Philadelphia Federal Reserve has tracked since 2012.
The delinquencies come as consumers have leaned heavily on borrowing to pay for everything from groceries to vacations — expenses that have risen sharply during the pandemic recovery — and as higher interest rates to curb inflation have pushed card rates to record highs.
The Philadelphia Fed report, released Wednesday, found the number of accounts with balances at least 30 days past due fell in the first quarter, and total card balances dipped somewhat as well. Both are seasonal trends that typically occur at the start of the year after the holiday spending season, the report noted.
Even so, “account holders who are behind have larger balances left unpaid,” the researchers wrote.
The figures add to a worrying portrait of U.S. consumer credit, with first-quarter data released in May by the New York Federal Reserve showing household debt swelling and credit card and auto loan delinquency rates rising across age groups. Consumer spending has largely held up this year even as the economy cools and many tighten their belts. Wealthier households are still splurging on experiences like travel, while big brands dangle promotions to keep tighter-budget customers coming back.
“The fact that we see more people carrying balances for a longer period of time, and now more people falling behind, is evidence of the struggle that millions of households are engaged in just trying to make ends meet,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at the personal finance company Bankrate.
Faced with steep rates and rising debt burdens, some consumers are thinking twice about extending themselves further.
The Philadelphia Fed also found declines in the number of new credit card accounts in the first quarter. While that’s also typical in the months after the holidays, the total is down from the same period last year, and major Wall Street firms have flagged recently that cardholders are tapping the brakes on spending.
A similar caution is showing up in the housing market, where mortgage initiations reached a record low in the Philadelphia Fed’s data. Mortgage demand has been on the downtrend even as rates ease, as some prospective homebuyers sit tight in hopes that the Federal Reserve will finally start lowering interest rates in the months ahead.
Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they’re going to take the stairs going down.
Bankrate CHief Financial Analyst Greg McBride
Cassandra Happe, an analyst at the personal finance website WalletHub, said the Philadelphia Fed’s mortgage data highlights “deepening affordability issues, with high housing costs and mortgage rates discouraging new home purchases.”
“The rising average loan size points to a market increasingly dominated by higher-income buyers, exacerbating housing inequality,” she said in an email.
As inflation has cooled, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by September. But Bankrate’s McBride warned that it will take awhile for consumers to feel relief.
“Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they’re going to take the stairs going down,” he said. “Interest rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation.”Davis Giangiulio is an intern with NBC News' business and economy unit."
NBC_4,"Senate passes Defiance act, which could allow non-consensual deepfake victims to sue",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/defiance-act-passes-senate-allow-deepfake-victims-sue-rcna163464,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"A federal bill that would allow victims of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes to sue people who create, share and receive them  has unanimously passed the Senate and now moves to the House for a vote. 
The Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (Defiance) Act of 2024, introduced by Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., would create a federal civil remedy for identifiable victims of deepfake sexual abuse. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who is sponsoring the legislation in the House, called the act the first federal protection for ""survivors of nonconsensual deepfake pornography."" 
""Over 90% of all deepfake videos made are nonconsensual sexually explicit images, and women are the targets 9 times out of 10,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill on Thursday. She has previously spoken out on being targeted with such deepfakes herself.
The House version of the bill is still being considered in committee.
Deepfakes typically refer to digitally manipulated images that falsely depict someone saying or doing something. They often take the form of sexually explicit photos and videos spread online. The material frequently merges a victim’s face with a body in a pornographic video. Generative artificial intelligence models can also create audio, videos and images that are entirely fake but look and sound realistic. 
The Defiance Act defines a nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfake as a “visual depiction created through the use of software, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or any other computer-generated or technological means to falsely appear to be authentic” that “depict the victim in the nude, or engaged in sexually-explicit conduct or sexual scenarios.” 
The civil remedy would be enforceable against people who create or possess the deepfake with intent to distribute it, as well as people who distribute and receive it if they knew or recklessly disregarded that the victim did not consent to the deepfake. The statute of limitations for the remedy is 10 years. 
The production of nonconsensual sexually explicit deepfakes has skyrocketed since 2023, first becoming popular with the likenesses of female public figures like influencers, politicians and celebrities. Cases have also sprung up at middle and high schools around the world, with teen girls frequently being victimized by their male classmates. While the trend has overwhelmingly targeted women and girls, men have also been depicted in deepfakes.
Following a high-profile incident with sexually suggestive AI-generated images of singer Taylor Swift going viral on X, formerly Twitter, multiple representatives introduced state and federal legislation to combat the issue. Durbin has been particularly vocal on the issue, sending a letter to the CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Sundar Pichai, in June asking for details on how the search engine planned to address the proliferation of deepfakes in search results. 
“Current laws don’t apply to deepfakes, leaving women and girls who suffer from this image-based sexual abuse without a legal remedy,” Durbin posted on X after the Defiance Act passed the Senate. “It’s time to give victims their day in court and the tools they need to fight back.”Kat Tenbarge is a tech and culture reporter for NBC News."

Argamani, who was rescued by Israeli forces on June 8, smiled and stood with her hands clasped in the gallery of the House chamber as lawmakers and guests paid tribute to her ordeal. She was embraced by Netanyahu's wife, Sara.
Netanyahu proceeded to recount the details of Argamani's kidnapping, describing ""Noa's look of desperation"" as militants took her into the Gaza Strip on the back of a motorcycle.
""I met Noa's mother, Liora, a few months ago. She was dying of cancer. She said to me, 'Prime Minister, I have one final wish. I wish to hug my daughter Noa one last time before I die.'""
Netanyahu went on to describe the ""breathtaking commando rescue operation"" that freed Argamani and three other Israeli hostages. The prime minister's account of the operation drew another round of applause.
""I think it's one of the most moving things,"" Netanyahu went on to say. ""When Noa was reunited with her mother Liora, and her mother's last wish came true.""
Liora Argamani died of brain cancer just over three weeks after Noa was rescued. 
Noa Argamani was at the Nova music festival in southern Israel when Hamas militants launched their attack and she was taken captive. In the days and weeks that followed, a short video clip of her kidnapping circulated widely on social media platforms, drawing international attention to the plight of the hostages.
She turned 26 while she was in captivity.
Argamani's boyfriend, Avinatan Or, was also kidnapped. He is believed to remain in Gaza along with roughly 100 other hostages.
Netanyahu's remarks marked the first time the Israeli leader has addressed Congress since the Hamas terror attack and the beginning of Israel's monthslong military campaign in Gaza. In his speech, he compared Oct. 7 to Pearl Harbor and 9/11.
He also blasted protests against his handling of the war — both on college campuses this spring and outside the Capitol as he spoke.
Hamas and other militants seized around 247 hostages during the Oct. 7 attack, which left around 1,200 people dead. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including 210 people who died during the operation that freed Argamani.Daniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News."

NBC_7,20-year-old college student dies after falling from Yosemite's Half Dome hike,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/college-student-grace-rohloff-dies-yosemite-fall-rcna163407,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"An Arizona college student died earlier this month after slipping and falling down during a hike at California's Yosemite National Park, officials confirmed Wednesday.
Grace Rohloff, 20, was hiking with her father on July 13 and had successfully reached the summit of Yosemite's Half Dome, one of the park's most famous and challenging hikes. But while descending the Half Dome cables during a sudden thunderstorm and downpour, she slipped on a wet portion of the rock and fell down the side of the mountain, her father, Jonathan Rohloff, said in an interview with KPNX.
The Mariposa County coroner's office confirmed that the fall resulted in Grace's death.
""She was in between the wooden blocks and slipped to the ground and you know it just happened very fast,"" Rohloff told KPNX. ""There's no way 10 minutes before, when she was up there smiling ear to ear, that I thought I only had 10 minutes left with her. It was a tragedy.""
Rohloff described how the pair had completed several hikes together throughout Arizona, and how his daughter was thrilled when she secured a permit to hike Yosemite's Half Dome. The dome stands over 8,800 feet above sea level, and a round-trip hike to the summit covers more than 14 miles. The Half Dome cables encompass the final portion of the hike and allow hikers to climb without rock climbing equipment.
""She told me it was something that was on her bucket list, that she always wanted to do, and she was so happy about it,"" Rohloff said, describing her daughter as ""fearless.""
According to Rohloff, Grace was pursuing an education degree at Arizona State University and planned to become a student-teacher at Valley Luthern High School, where she had graduated. The high school announced on Facebook that a celebration of her life is planned for this Saturday.
Yosemite National Park officials could not immediately be reached for comment and have not issued a statement on the student's death. Rohloff told KPNX that he hopes for a safer cable system at Half Dome, a site that has taken the lives of other hikers in the past.
""If we can make the cabling system at Yosemite a lot safer for people to see that beautiful piece of God's Earth and not be put in danger, then that would be something that she would have wanted,"" Rohloff said.News Associate "
NBC_8,Adam Lambert and Auli'i Cravalho to step into 'Cabaret' on Broadway this fall,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/adam-lambert-aulii-cravalho-cabaret-broadway-rcna163491,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"Get ready to say willkommen to the next stars to enter the Kit Kat Club on Broadway — Adam Lambert and Auli’i Cravalho,
Producers of the Tony Award-nominated revival revealed Wednesday that Lambert, the singer-songwriter who has fronted Queen, and Cravalho, the voice of the title character in Disney’s animated musical film “Moana, “will play the Emcee and Sally Bowles, respectively, in the current revival of “Cabaret.”
The two — each making their Broadway debuts — will take over for English actors Eddie Redmayne and Gayle Rankin, who both earned Tony Award nominations for their parts. The newcomers will start Sept. 16 and play through the end of March.
“I feel so lucky to have this baton passed to Adam and I,” said Cravalho in an email from Indonesia. She noted that she saw the musical before her audition, pen and paper in hand. “The show feels so fresh and current.”
Lambert, who has just released his new dance-centric EP “Afters,” started his career in musical theater— he was in the ensemble of the first national tour of “Wicked” and later was in the show in Los Angeles for two years. “It sounds cliche, but this is literally a childhood dream,” he said by phone.
He steps into the sinister and lascivious role of master of ceremonies, one made famous by Joel Grey and Alan Cumming. Redmayne’s take was more dark and audacious.
“I get the role. I get who he is. I’m excited about it. I think it works with my skill set,” Lambert says. “And I’m really, really excited to be in a cast again because with pop music, it’s like it’s all on you. To be able to do a show with a whole team of people onstage, it’s what I miss.”
“Cabaret,” about the collapse of democracy and rise of fascism in Germany, centers on the world of the indulgent Kit Kat Klub in Berlin as it becomes more precarious on the brink of World War II. The songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb include “Willkommen” and “Tomorrow Belongs to Me.”
“It’s so timely right now. We’re potentially on the verge of fascism again, just like they were then,” says Lambert. “There’s so many parallels to what’s going on in the real world, which is what I think gives it so much weight, and so much validity.”
Cravalho, who appeared in “The Power” on Amazon, NBC’s drama “Rise” and Netflix’s “All Together Now,” also starred in the film adaptation of Tina Fey’s Broadway “Mean Girls: The Musical.”
She next takes up one of the stage’s most iconic roles, one created by Liza Minnelli. Others who have played Sally Bowles on Broadway include Natasha Richardson, Michelle Williams, Emma Stone and Sienna Miller.
Cravalho recalls listening to the Minnelli-led cast album as a child in Hawaii and looks forward to tackling the number “Don’t Tell Mama” because of “the movement needed to bring it to life.”
“I’m thrilled to be playing a character whose background isn’t really established. Sally is incredibly clever, and always using her wits to find her next bed or drink. But the fun really comes in the detail work,” she said."
NBC_9,Capitol Police pepper spray and arrest demonstrators protesting Netanyahu visit,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/capitol-police-pepper-spray-demonstrators-protesting-netanyahu-visit-rcna163502,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Capitol Police used pepper spray to disperse a protest opposing a congressional visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has drawn anger from anti-war activists. 
The group of protesters were with the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition, and comes just a day after protesters with  Jewish Voice for Peace were arrested in the Cannon House Office Building. 
Capitol police posted to social media that the group pepper sprayed on Wednesday had ""failed to obey our order to move back from our police line."" Police also alleged that part of the group had become violent. 
""We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,"" police said. 
Capitol Police later confirmed that six people were arrested in the House Galleries
An NBC News producer witnessed some protesters getting close to the Capitol Police officers on the corner of Louisiana and Constitution avenues. The situation escalated quickly afterwards and members of the NBC News crews could feel the chemical on their skin.
ANSWER Coalition posted video to X of the incident, in which one protester can be heard yelling, ""f--- you, stupid pigs"" as a liquid is sprayed in their direction.
""Capitol police brutally pepper spray and tear gas protestors marching against war criminal Netanyahu!"" the post said. ""But the march continues. The people stand with Palestine!""
Protesters gathered outside of Union Station, which is only a few minutes walking distance from the Capitol. People reported on social media that protesters burned an effigy of Netanyahu and tried to lower the American flag outside of the station.
U.S. Park Police released a statement that a permit was revoked for gatherings in Columbus Circle, the area surrounding Union Station. Crowds were ordered to leave the area.
""A crowd in Columbus Circle is engaged in criminal activity and confronting law enforcement on scene,"" the agency said. ""USPP is attempting to deescalate and contact the event organizer for help.""
Amtrak also warned customers to expect delays near Union Station due to protest activity. The transportation company advised travelers to have their tickets ready and anticipate intermittent closures of entrances and exits.
Netanyahu is meeting with congressional legislators in Capitol Hill and delivered his first address to the lawmakers since Oct. 7, when a Hamas-led terror attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 civilians and soldiers and sparked a monthslong war in Gaza that has killed an estimated 39,000 Palestinians. 
Protesters outside of the Capitol building were standing behind a large canvas banner that reads “Arrest Netanyahu for Genocide” and planned to create a “people’s red line against genocide” and conduct a “citizen’s arrest” of Netanyahu.
The group has provided attendees with signs on wood posts with phrases like “free all Palestinian political prisoners” and “lift the siege on Gaza now” as well as a “wanted” posted for Netanyahu.
The International Criminal Court announced in May that it was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu along with other Israeli leaders to charge them with war crimes and crimes against humanity. President Joe Biden condemned the move as ""outrageous"" and Netanyahu described it as ""absurd."" 
The ICC sought a similar warrant for Hamas militant leader Yahya Sinwar as well as other Hamas officials believed responsible for the Oct. 7 attack and the subsequent invasion of Gaza by Israeli forces.
Additionally, Netanyahu has faced both domestic and international criticism of his handling of hostage negotiations since the beginning of the war. Families of five Israeli Americans who are still being held hostage have urged Netanyahu to bring their loved one homes.
Protests in Israel have grown as citizens demand Netanyahu focus on striking a cease-fire deal. The Israeli military announced this week that two more hostages held in Gaza have died, bringing the total number of people believed to have died in Hamas' captivity to at least 46.
Inside the chamber where Netanyahu was speaking, three people were arrested after unbuttoning their shirts to reveal yellow T-shirts that read “SEAL THE DEAL NOW,"" in reference to the ongoing cease-fire negotiations. Two men and one woman were put in zip-tie cuffs and escorted away from the chamber.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the only Palestinian American in Congress, held a “war criminal” sign during Netanyahu’s speech as he criticized pro-Palestinian demonstrations in his address.
Netanyahu thanked Biden in his speech for all of the president's efforts to aid Israel and bring hostages home. Biden “came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour,"" he said.
He also expressed gratitude to former president Donald Trump for his past support of Israel. 
The prime minister urged the legislators for continued, bipartisan support of Israel as it fights Hamas. Notably, he did not shake hands with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
Schumer is the top ranking Jewish politician and has been an outspoken supporter of Israel throughout his political career. But Schumer also joined calls for Netanyahu to be replaced earlier this year, agreeing with Israeli protesters who have demanded new elections.

The Israeli Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation that Musk had been invited to the speech as Netanyahu’s guest.
Ahead of the speech, Musk was seen in the gallery, above the floor, seated near Netanyahu's wife, Sara Netanyahu.
The Tesla Motors CEO’s visit to Capitol Hill came a day after he announced on X that his satellite internet company Starlink had been activated in a Gaza hospital, with the support of Israel and the United Arab Emirates.
Nine months into the Israel-Hamas war and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Netanyahu’s speech has become a lightning rod of controversy, triggering an eruption of protests in Washington.
Shortly before Netanyahu was scheduled to begin speaking, U.S. Capitol Police announced they were “deploying pepper spray” against protesters who had “started to become violent” close to the Capitol.
More than 30 members of Congress said they were not planning to attend Netanyahu’s address, many in protest of the Israeli prime minister’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war.
Despite the absences, the prime minister entered a crowded House floor to loud applause and cheering, shaking hands with various lawmakers on his way to the podium.
Vice President Kamala Harris is also not attending Netanyahu’s speech, a conspicuous departure from tradition. The White House attributed her absence to the demands of travel.
Typically, the vice president presides over joint congressional sessions, but Harris is traveling Wednesday, as the newly minted Democratic front-runner for the party’s presidential nomination.
Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is also skipping the speech due to his “duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,” a Trump campaign official told NBC News.
In the vice president’s absence, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., would usually take her place as the president pro tempore of the Senate, but she is not attending Netanyahu’s address for ideological reasons, according to NBC News.
Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Md., will preside over Netanyahu’s joint address.
“The United States relationship with the State of Israel transcends politics and partisanship,” Cardin said in a statement to NBC News. “It transcends any one Israeli government or any one U.S. administration.”
Though Harris attributed her Wednesday absence to travel, many of the at least 30 lawmakers have so far said they are skipping the speech to boycott Netanyahu. Several, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they will instead be meeting with families of hostages held by Hamas or attending a panel on Middle East peace and security.
“Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress. On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among the loudest critics of Netanyahu as the war carries on.
Wednesday’s speech is Netanyahu’s fourth address to Congress, the last of which took place in March 2015.
While the Prime Minister is on Capitol Hill, he will meet with the top four congressional lawmakers: House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.
On Thursday, Netanyahu will also have separate meetings with President Joe Biden and Harris at the White House."

Kimani Joehon Marshall, 44, of Fayetteville, turned himself into authorities on Monday on recommended charges of larceny of a dog, possession of stolen property and cruelty to animals, according to a statement from Sheriff Wayne Coats with the Harnett County Sheriff’s Office.
The tan and white pup was named Tori, according to court documents and the sheriff’s office. The dog was valued at $5,500, according to an arrest warrant issued for Marshall on July 11.
Marshall stole the dog on July 3 while delivering packages, the sheriff’s office said. He then continued on his route.
“Investigators believe that K-9 Tori died due to heat related issues as she traveled inside the FEDEX truck as temperatures were reportedly in the 90’s,” Sheriff Coats said.
The pooch’s body was found on July 10 in Lillington, according to the sheriff’s office.
Marshall was jailed on $50,000 secured bond. Court records show his bond was posted.
Marshall was reached by phone Wednesday afternoon and declined comment. He said his attorney would provide comment for him, but that attorney did not respond by publication.
FedEx declined to comment on whether Marshall was a fulltime employee or contractor at the time of the alleged incident.
In a statement, the company said Marshall no longer works for FedEx.
“We extend our deepest sympathies to the family on the loss of their beloved pet,” the statement said. “We understand the importance of people’s pets in their lives and deeply regret the pain that this has caused. The driver is no longer providing service on behalf of FedEx.”Antonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. "
NBC_12,'Twisters' director Lee Isaac Chung says a real-life tornado encounter drew him to film,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/twisters-lee-isaac-chung-film-tornado-encounter-rcna163473,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"“Twisters” director Lee Isaac Chung’s first introduction to twisters was through a real life encounter with a tornado in Arkansas — a traumatic experience that drew him to the original film.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, the director said that just a few weeks after his Korean American family moved to a trailer on a farm in Arkansas, news broke that a tornado was coming. Chung remembers his father telling his family, “We’re going to climb down to this low part of the ground and hide out” if the tornado comes.
Chung said his family, having only recently moved to the United States, didn’t know what to do. “I remember that being quite a traumatic experience,” he told Vanity Fair.
Yet, when the original “Twister” came out in theaters when Chung was 17, he thought that the movie would fall short of the tense trailers advertising the movies. “I remember thinking, when I saw that, That’s not going to be an interesting movie,” Chung told Vanity Fair. “When you see a tornado, where I grew up, you just run from it.”
When Chung saw the 1996 film, however, he immediately connected with the story and landscape. The Midwestern scenes and his memories of tornadoes drew Chung to direct the movie “Twisters.”
“The original ‘Twister,’ when it came out, it meant a great deal to me because I was watching a film that took place around where I grew up,” Chung said in an interview with NBC Inside. “I grew up on a farm, just outside of Westville, Oklahoma, and that terrain, that landscape, is a part of me.”
The movie was produced by Universal Studios, which like NBC News, is part of  NBCUniversal, a Comcast company.
Chung told Vanity Fair that he had “an instant connection” with the 1996 film. “I remember telling my parents, ‘That reminded me so much of when we were running from that night tornado,’” Chung said. His connection to the landscape led Chung to insist that the movie be filmed in Oklahoma, instead of in Atlanta.
“Twisters,” the disaster epic sequel to “Twister,” made $80.5 million upon its debut.
“It’s perfect summer entertainment,” David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told Variety. “This is essentially the same havoc we saw the first time, but it’s 28 years later, and the spectacle, the special effects and the set pieces are bigger and better.”

NBC_13,Michigan outlaws the 'gay and trans panic defense' in criminal trials,https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/michigan-outlaws-gay-trans-panic-defense-rcna163465,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Michigan has outlawed the so-called gay and trans panic defense, which allows criminal defense attorneys to use a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity as a defense argument.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, signed House Bill 4718 into law Tuesday. The legislation states that an individual’s “actual or perceived sex, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation” is not admissible in a criminal trial to “demonstrate reasonable provocation,” “show that an act was committed in a heat of passion” or “support a defense of reduced mental capacity.”
In a statement shared on Tuesday, the governor’s office said the bill “significantly expands” protections for the LGBTQ community “by protecting them from violent acts of discrimination, prejudice, and hate crimes.”
Michigan is now the 20th state to prohibit this type of defense, according to Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Last year, Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., reintroduced the LGBTQ+ Panic Defense Prohibition Act, which would ban such defenses in federal court.
The highest-profile example of the “gay panic defense” was perhaps the attempt to use it in the murder trial of Aaron McKinney, one of the two men accused of fatally beating 21-year-old gay student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998. The defense was unsuccessful, and both men were sentenced to life in prison.
There have been cases, however, where the panic defense has been used with some success. In 2018, gay advocates were outraged after a Texas man, James Miller, received a light sentence after fatally stabbing his neighbor, Daniel Spencer, who had allegedly tried to kiss Miller. And in 2009, Joseph Biedermann was acquitted of murder in the killing of Terrance Hauser, whom he admitted to stabbing more than 60 times; Biedermann alleged that Hauser had threatened to rape him. 
The Michigan bill was introduced by state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, who is bisexual, and passed in the state House by a vote of 56-54 last month. In September 2023, after the Michigan House Criminal Justice Committee heard testimony on House Bill 4718, Pohutsky wrote in a post on X that Michigan is among the top 10 states that most frequently use the panic defense, citing a statistic from the  Equality Michigan Action Network. 
“With anti-LGBTQ violence on the rise, particularly against our trans family, it’s more important than ever that we no longer allow prejudice to discount LGBTQ violence,” she wrote.
At the September hearing, Pohutsky said “the LGBTQ panic defense is often deployed as a component of other defenses to play on the unfortunate prejudices of some judges and juries in an effort to mitigate penalties for these crimes.”
Emme Zanotti, director of advocacy and civic engagement at Equality Michigan, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group that expressed support for the legislation at the September hearing, said in a statement shared with NBC News on Wednesday that LGBTQ community members “deserve the same protections as everyone else.”
“Representative Pohutsky’s bill, like many that have passed in Michigan the last year and a half, is about righting the wrongs of our past and building a more united and inclusive future for our state,” she wrote. “Prohibiting the use of the LGBTQ panic defense means there are no more free passes for violent crimes against our community members.”

NBC_14,How Kamala Harris is going about finding a VP pick in just 2 weeks,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-finding-vp-pick-just-2-weeks-rcna163334,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Vice President Kamala Harris has looked at the vetting process from both sides now. But she doesn't have much time to spare.
It was only on Sunday that President Joe Biden abandoned his campaign and effectively handed it to her, leaving two weeks for Democrats to nominate her and a running mate if they hope to beat an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure their ticket appears on ballots in every state. Modern candidates usually have months to decide, as Biden did when he dragged his feet in picking her in 2020, and as Republican nominee Donald Trump did while holding a virtual public pageant this year before putting Sen. JD Vance of Ohio on his ticket.
Harris doesn't have that luxury.
She is winnowing her list quickly — in part because of the compressed timeline and in part because several potential candidates, including Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, have taken themselves out of the running. In interviews with more than a half-dozen Democratic insiders, the names of a handful of hopefuls have emerged as leading contenders: Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Roy Cooper of North Carolina. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are also in the mix, these people said. 
All of them are white men, though one source said a name that has been floated is Cedric Richmond, a Black man who is a senior Biden adviser and former congressman from Louisiana.
""You need someone who’s moderate, obviously, a white male, and I would say she needs someone from a border state,” said Ashley Etienne, who formerly worked as the vice president’s communications director. “I think her choosing a white male counterbalances her race and her gender in a way that could open her up to peeling off many of those Nikki Haley voters, those disaffected Republicans. Independents. And I think it rounds off the ticket in a way that I think feels fresh, feels also forward, but also feels fully aware of where we are as a nation.”
Etienne added a prediction: ""I think it's Mark Kelly if I had to bet.""
The Arizona senator, a military veteran and former astronaut, is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who survived being shot in the head during a 2011 attack in Tucson. Advocates for him say that he not only checks important political boxes but has a backstory that will appeal to many voters and gives him credibility on key issues such as gun control, national security and border issues.
Follow live updates on the 2024 election
A major Democratic Party donor who had pushed to keep Biden in the race, but is now ""happy as a clam"" with Harris about to be atop the ticket, said other big donors are talking mostly about Kelly, Shapiro, Beshear and Cooper.
This person called Shapiro ""an Obama-level political talent"" who has ""a brand in Pennsylvania that's worth it."" 
The campaign is particularly interested in someone who will appeal to the demographics and the voters that Biden would have brought to the table, including older white voters and suburban women, according to a source familiar with the campaign’s thinking. That source said Harris’ team also would like the running mate to appeal specifically to white men who don’t like Trump but who may question whether they want to vote for a Black and South Asian woman.
“Let’s just face it. There’s a lot of sexist, racist white dudes out there in America who don’t like Trump, but just need a little extra validation,” one person familiar with the campaign's thinking said. “And, bringing one of the people mentioned onto the ticket helps validate her among those constituents.”
Perhaps more important than a white male hopeful's appeal to his own demographic is how he is received by suburban women of all races.  
“They are feeling like you need somebody who can go in and talk to these suburban women,” a second person familiar with the campaign's thinking said. “The internal polling is showing that’s who you’re targeting. You’re targeting them on reproductive rights. You’re targeting them on democracy. You’re targeting them on law and order. You’re not really trying to sell them on governing or on record or any of that, but these are sort of softer issues.” 
The choice of a running mate is one of the few major decisions a vice president running for the top job can use to signal to voters that they have the judgment to be president. So while Harris could always make an outside-the-box pick, people close to her expect that she will put a high premium on those kinds of traditional criteria — campaign experience, ticket balance and personal relationship — that helped her land the job four years ago.
Harris will want ""someone that she can trust,"" said Karen Finney, a veteran Democratic operative who is close to Harris' camp. ""One of the things she's probably learned as VP is that you need that. You need to have those voices, who are those people that you trust to tell you what you don't want to hear.""
Or, as another longtime Democratic operative and donor said: ""She doesn't want to get stuck with someone because it's advantageous politically.""
And yet the first order of business for Harris, and the party that has placed its trust in her, is beating Trump.
Harris campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz played down ""any reporting on developments"" in the process as ""premature and speculative"" in a statement issued Tuesday. 
""Vice President Harris is considering a large pool of qualified candidates, and will choose a partner that shares her commitment to fighting for the middle class, protecting Americans' freedoms, and protecting our democracy,"" Munoz said. ""And when that candidate is chosen, together they will handedly defeat the Trump-Vance ticket in November.""
As she looks to make her decision, Harris has surrounded herself with a tight circle of aides and advisers. The vetting process is being led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, and Harris has been traveling with Tony West, a former Holder lieutenant at the Justice Department who is also her brother-in-law. Her chief of staff, Lorraine Voles; her campaign chief of staff, Sheila Nix; and spokesman Brian Fallon — another Justice Department alumnus — are among those sources say she is consulting with.
Michael Blake, a finance committee member for the Harris campaign and founder and CEO of Kairos Democracy Project, said Harris has to find a running mate with a particular mix of attributes.
""It has to be someone she trusts and someone who actually is going to be a bulldog against this JD Vance nonsense,"" Blake said. 
If Harris is elected, she will be the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American person to serve as president. That means the background of the person she puts on the ticket — and their ability to talk about hers — will be important, several people who spoke to NBC News for this story said.
“Race, absolutely, is paramount,” Blake said. “You have to pick someone who can go into spaces and be direct that this Black woman is ready to be president. And, I tie it in a lot of ways to Biden. I was with them in 2008 in Michigan when Sen. Biden went to Macomb County and gave a speech and he said, ‘I was with Barack Obama at the convention. He’s a good man. He’s a good father.’”
In other words, now that she's about to take Biden's place on the ticket, she may need a Biden of her own.Yamiche Alcindor is an NBC News Washington correspondent.

NBC_15,Former Harvard women's hockey coach files gender discrimination suit against university,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-harvard-womens-hockey-coach-sues-university-gender-discriminati-rcna163433,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Former Harvard women’s hockey coach Katey Stone filed a sex discrimination suit against the university Tuesday, alleging it forced her out following reports of misconduct she denies.
Stone, who coached the team for 27 seasons, resigned in June 2023 amid an investigation into allegations of a toxic culture in the program.
These allegations, first reported last year by The Boston Globe, include Stone allegedly making insensitive remarks about Native Americans, body-shaming players and overseeing a culture of hazing that although Stone wasn’t directly involved in, she was still responsible for preventing.
According to a report published last year in The Athletic, players were pressured by upperclassmen to participate in an annual ""naked skate,"" during which some freshmen were told to ""superman"" slide on the ice, leaving them with ice burns and bleeding nipples.
There was also the annual ""Initiation Week,"" where underclassmen were urged, among other things, to mimic sex acts and overconsume alcohol. 
The Athletic did not find evidence that Stone played any role in these hazing incidents, and in the suit filed Tuesday, Stone denied having any knowledge of them or of fostering an inappropriate culture. 
In the complaint, she decries her forced resignation, calling it “part and parcel of a larger culture at the University wherein female coaches are undervalued, underpaid, heavily scrutinized, and held to a breathtakingly more stringent standard of behavior than their male counterparts.” 
“I will no longer stand idly by in the face of inequity and injustice and allow one of the world’s elite universities to continue to hide behind the fraudulent veil of fairness,” Stone said at a news conference Tuesday, The Boston Globe reported. 
“The loss of my career, my reputation, my ability to earn a living doing a job I love, is gut-wrenching,” she said. “The damage has been real and affects me every single day.”
Harvard told NBC News in a statement that the university does not comment on active litigation. 
In the complaint, Stone alleges that the former players accusing her of misconduct were acting out of a “personal vendetta” and therefore shared false information with the Globe.  
The complaint mentions that despite Harvard’s public acknowledgement that the team has not fostered a culture of hazing, the university nevertheless tacitly endorsed this narrative by forcing Stone to retire.  
This wouldn’t have happened if Stone were a man, the suit claims. 
“Harvard has long accepted, if not outright approved and encouraged, behavior akin to the allegations against Coach Stone from its male coaches and staff without incident,” the complaint states. 
It goes on to list examples of misconduct by men’s teams under the purview of male coaches who weren’t punished, such as in 2016 when the Harvard men’s soccer team came under investigation for ranking the female soccer team based on sex appeal. 
Stone in the complaint also accuses the university of gender-based pay discrimination, alleging that she was paid “at an egregiously lesser scale” than the men’s hockey coach, and that the university refused to reveal the breakdown of compensation levels between male and female coaches. 
Stone is seeking no less than $5 million in damages from the university as well as from the 50 Jane Doe defendants accused of defaming her. 
She became head coach prior to the 1994-95 season. Over her 29-year tenure, Stone won more than 500 games and led her team to six Frozen Four appearances and four NCAA title games.Mike Gagliardi is a researcher with the NBC News Network Desk."
NBC_16,"Inflation and $2,000 camps are creating a summer crisis for working parents",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/inflation-2000-camps-are-creating-summer-crisis-working-parents-comple-rcna163482,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"The math seemed impossible, but numbers don’t lie — it was less expensive for Julie Kelley to send her 9-year-old son to seven different summer camps in three states than to enroll him in one full-time program in Vermont, where they live.
Summer vacation lasts 10 weeks for the Kelleys. And it will cost Kelley and her husband Richard about $2,000 for their only child.
When Kelley searched for full-time, five-day summer camps near Saint Johnsbury, Vermont, where her family lives, she says she couldn’t find any options. Other full-time camps in Burlington, Vermont, about a two-hour drive from their house, cost $400 per week.
By the time school starts in August, Kelley’s son will have attended day camps in Vermont, New Hampshire and Minnesota, where they’ll stay with relatives. All the camps cost between $150 and $400 per week.
“It sounds insane, but those were the best options within our budget, even planning months in advance,” the 50-year-old mom tells CNBC Make It. The local day camp they used last summer closed because of staffing shortages.
Kelley, a communications consultant who works from home full time, says she and her husband are spending “more than double” what they did last year on other child-care arrangements.
“Any time I run into other parents in line for coffee or at the park and ask how they’re doing, I see the same sleep-deprived expression reflecting back to me,” she says. “Summer shouldn’t feel this hard.” 
American families now spend nearly one-fifth of their income, an average of $800 per month, on child care, the Federal Reserve reports.
The rising cost of child care is not a seasonal issue, but the summer months can be especially challenging for families as schools close and parents are on the hook for day care, sleepaway camps and other expenses. 
The average cost of summer camp in the U.S. is about $87 a day, with sleepaway camp tuition at about $173 a day, according to the American Camp Association.
Years marked by inflation and a nationwide child-care crisis mean that families are more cash-strapped than usual. 
Summer camp isn’t an option for many households across the U.S. as 40% of parents say that they can’t afford such programs due to a higher cost of living, according to a recent Credit Karma survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults. 
Of those who are sending their children to camp, nearly 30% are going into debt or resorting to buy-now, pay-later options to cover the cost. 
A separate report on summer parenting, released in June by the non-profit organization ParentsTogetherAction, found that 59% of parents have someone in their household who had to cut back on hours or leave a job because they can’t afford reliable seasonal child care.
In summers past, both of Margaret McGriff’s daughters, ages 7 and 12, would attend a day camp near their home in Lake Worth, Florida, Mondays through Fridays while she was at work. 
“It was the perfect setup,” McGriff, who is a single parent, says. “I’d drop them before driving to the office and pick them up on my way home around 5 p.m.”
This summer looks a lot different. After months of struggling with higher tax, grocery and gas bills, among other necessities, McGriff says she could only afford to send her younger daughter back to camp. 
The program costs about $2,000 per child, which means she’ll save $2,000 by keeping her 12-year-old daughter home for the summer.

McGriff, who is a senior content strategist at Labor Finders, a staffing and recruitment firm in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, had to ask her boss if she could work mostly from home until August, as she couldn’t find a nanny or part-time camp for her eldest daughter within her budget. 
Instead of spending three days in-office each week as she normally would, McGriff is commuting once a week between June and August. On Wednesdays, her daughter comes with her to the office.
“I’m super fortunate to have that job flexibility, but it’s still been incredibly challenging to balance parenting and working full time,” McGriff, 42, says. “This is the first summer I haven’t had access to affordable child care. It’s just mentally exhausting.” 
McGriff says that, despite the unexpected challenges this summer brought, she and her daughter have grown “even closer” and are finding silver linings in being home together. 
Her older daughter has been reading, baking and completing workbooks to kill time while McGriff is at her job. In the evenings and on weekends, McGriff takes her children to museums, parks, the movie theater and other outings to make up for the field trips her oldest daughter is missing from not going to camp. 
Natasha Brown works from home as a data annotator from midnight until 8 a.m. five days a week, then clocks into her “second shift” as a working mother to six kids, all off from school and home for the summer. 
“It is complete chaos,” Brown, 40, says. “This has been the most stressful summer ever.” 
Brown and her husband, Christopher, live in Cumming, Georgia with their children — their youngest child just turned 1, and their oldest is 20 — and two dogs. Christopher also works from home full time as a data manager for a health tech company. 
Natasha Brown and her husband, Christopher, opted to keep their six children home (pictured here with five of their children) for the summer and save the money they would have spent on camps for a family vacation in the fall.Photo: Natasha Brown
Last summer, the parents hired a full-time nanny for about $800 per week to watch their four youngest children while they worked. The Browns would also send their children to part-time day camps and one-off activities like cello and singing lessons. 
This summer, however, Brown says they’ve been “crushed” by higher child-care costs and had no choice but to keep their children at home. Hiring another full-time nanny would’ve cost the family about $1,800 per week, more than double the amount it cost last year.
“At that rate, almost my entire paycheck, or my husband’s, would be spent on summer child care,” she says. “We want our son and daughters to have a fun summer but we don’t want to blow our savings to make that happen.”
Her two oldest children, who are 16 and 20, have summer jobs, and the younger three — ages 11, 9 and 5 — are taking online classes in French, Spanish, math, ballet and other subjects on the platform Outschool. Classes can cost as little as $10 or upwards of $100 depending on the subject.
Other than that, Brown says she’s tried to keep her children occupied with summer movie marathons and encouraging them to play outside with other children on their street and have sleepovers with their friends. 
She and her husband take turns watching their 1-year-old daughter when they’re not working. 
Brown estimates that she’s saving at least $3,000 by keeping her children home this summer — money that she’s planning to use toward a family trip to Martha’s Vineyard in September. 
“Even if we didn’t get the relaxing summer we hoped for, it’s a short-term sacrifice to ensure that our bills are paid, our children are comfortable and we don’t slip into debt,” she adds. “I still feel blessed to have that option.”   "
NBC_17,Retailers shift their thinking on delivery as consumer need for speed raises costs,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/retailers-shift-thinking-delivery-consumer-need-speed-raises-costs-rcna163481,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Consumer need for speed in package delivery, which has reached its apex with same-day shipping, has placed retailers in a tough spot when it comes to managing transportation costs. The result is increased competition among shippers for retail volume in a market dominated by FedEx and UPS, according to a new survey from global consulting firm AlixPartners.
Retail executives surveyed say as more — especially younger — consumers demand same-day delivery, the financial payoff isn’t there.
Roughly three-quarters (76%) of retail executives surveyed by AlixPartners said delivery cost on a per-package basis has increased since last year, and three out of four said home delivery does not add to profitability. An overwhelming majority (85%) said reducing their total cost per order is the No. 1 priority for last-mile delivery.
Shippers are facing their own cost pressures. “Carriers have experienced meaningful inflation in wages, equipment, repair and maintenance, insurance, fuel, tires, real estate, health-care costs, and more,” said Marc Iampieri, global co-leader of logistics & transportation, and partner & managing director of AlixPartners. “Those costs are offset by future rate increases. There is also a macro supply-and-demand equation to consider as e-commerce growth outstrips retail growth.”
Iampieri said the recent UPS-Teamsters contract renewal is a good example of wage inflation. 
To save on delivery costs, retailers are moving away from reliance on single carriers in last-mile delivery. Three out of four executives reported they are using a mix of last-mile options. To date, the shift in shipping strategy has helped FedEx, but hurt UPS. FedEx was the primary last-mile carrier cited by 42% of executives, an increase of 15% year over year. But UPS saw a decrease in retailers using it as a sole last-mile carrier, dropping from 35% in 2023 to 25% in 2024.
UPS reported weaker-than-expected profits for Q2 this week and suffered its worst single-day stock loss on record.
UPS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
In its earnings commentary on Tuesday, it cited customers “trading down,” moving to more economic options in the most recent quarter, but also indicated this was linked to the “acceleration of new entrants, new e-commerce customers” that were coming into the market, assumed to be a reference to Asian low-cost retailers and Amazon rivals Shein and Temu. UPS also noted that it lost customers year over year due to the Teamsters contract negotiations in 2023 and customers signing long-term contracts elsewhere. 
Some alternative parcel delivery companies identified as benefitting from the move to diversify last-mile delivery include OnTrac, Pandion, and LSO/Lone Star Overnight. Additional delivery companies include Uber Eats and Uber Connect, Postmates, DoorDash, Instacart, and Shipt. 
Free delivery is still the big draw for consumers, with 92% saying that factors into their buying decisions, but the consumer threshold of waiting for product delivery is 3.5 days maximum, or else they say they will shop elsewhere.
“They are addressing this by shifting customer policies with half increasing minimum order spend in the past year,” said Chris Considine, a partner at AlixPartners. “When minimum delivery expectations aren’t met, 25% of shoppers will spend elsewhere.”
Almost two-thirds (64%) of retail executives surveyed said they increased the minimum order value for free shipping; 15% said they are requiring a minimum order value and membership for free shipping. Among consumers, 25% surveyed said they preferred to Buy Online, Pick Up in Store (BOPIS) versus delivery to avoid any shipping costs and to receive the product faster.
“While this trend has traditionally been driven by convenience, continuing shifts in service level improvements, expanding options, assortment, and return to in-person working environments are also playing a role,” Considine said.
Most consumers surveyed (92%) said a delayed order would impact their future purchase decisions and 82% expected compensation, but only 4% of companies surveyed said they would offer a discount on the next purchase for a late delivery.
Considine characterized online buying fundamentals as strong, with e-commerce sales of cleaning products up the most year over year, at 11%, followed by grocery and health/medical supply, both up 10%. Footwear and apparel purchases increased to a lesser extent.
Recent data from Motive, which tracks trucking visits to North American distribution facilities for the top five retailers, shows freight volume was up 30% year-over-year in June.
To cut costs on returns, retailers have also changed free shipping qualifications.
“Retailers are tightening the return policies such as shortening or enforcing the return window of time and eliminating free returns just for convenience and requiring a stated defect or issue with the good/product,” Iampieri said.
When given the option of shipping the return or an in-store return, over 80% of consumers reported they were willing to travel between 15-30 minutes for free in-store returns versus paying a shipping fee."
NBC_18,Monday was the world's hottest day ever recorded — breaking Sunday's short-lived record,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/hottest-day-ever-record-monday-sunday-rcna163408,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"Sunday’s record as the hottest day ever recorded on Earth lasted only one day. 
According to preliminary data from the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature reached 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.87 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, toppling the prior day’s record of 17.09 C.
In other words, the planet had its two warmest days back-to-back this week. 
Higher than normal winter temperatures in Antarctica helped push the globe to new highs, according to Copernicus. 
The records represent a milestone that climate scientists don’t expect to last long, as humans continue to fuel climate change by pumping fossil fuel pollution into the atmosphere.
Bob Henson, a meteorologist and climate writer for Yale Climate Connections, said that although he was not surprised that records have been broken, the spikes in temperatures during the last two years have still been “startling.”
“Let’s say your body temperature went up half a degree, that wouldn’t worry you if you’re 98.6 F, but if you’re already 103 F, that extra half a degree is really unsettling,” he said.
People have been feeling the effects of extreme heat across the globe this week and throughout the summer. California dealt with triple-digit temperatures in many areas on Monday, contributing to wildfire concerns in the region. Temperatures rose to 118 degrees in Al Dhaid, a city northeast of Dubai. And Southern Europe continued to swelter, with parts of Spain and Portugal under heat advisories.  
In addition to the effects of climate change, this summer has been especially hot because of El Niño, a natural pattern of circulation that brings warmer sea surface temperatures to the tropical eastern Pacific and can elevate global temperatures.
Henson expects La Niña, which is associated with cooler temperatures, to take effect later this year and subsequently reduce average temperatures.
“Even if next year doesn’t bring similar records, we know what the long term forecast is, and that’s warmer and warmer over time,” Henson said, adding: “When you turn up the burners and leave them on for a century, you’re going to see the water boil.”
Copernicus uses climate reanalysis data, which combines real-world observations and computer modeling of atmospheric circulation, to track global temperature. The program’s records date back to 1940. Until Sunday, the record for hottest day was 16.8 C on Aug. 12, 2016. 
Monday’s record could still be broken.  
“The event is still ongoing and it is possible the date of the peak may still change, but our data suggest we may see slightly lower temperatures in the next few days,” Carlo Buontempo, the director of Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.Elysee Barakett is a health intern at NBC News.

NBC_19,'Inside Out 2' is the highest-grossing animated movie ever,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/-2-highest-grossing-animated-movie-ever-rcna163474,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"Disney is back on top at the box office.
On Tuesday, “Inside Out 2” surpassed $1.46 billion in global ticket sales, making it the highest-grossing animated feature of all time, usurping another Disney title, “Frozen II.” 
Its box office will continue to grow. The film has yet to open in Japan, a region that contributed nearly $33 million to the $850.5 million global total of “Inside Out” in 2015.
The record-breaking box office for “Inside Out 2” comes after a series of theatrical hits and misses from the company, especially from its animated releases.
In particular, Pixar has suffered at the box office in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of its difficulties have come, in part, because Disney opted to debut a handful of animated features directly on streaming service Disney+ during theatrical closures and even once cinemas had reopened.
As a result, before “Inside Out 2,” no Disney animated feature from Pixar or its Walt Disney Animation studio had generated more than $480 million at the global box office since 2019.
Of note, Disney does not consider its 2019 “The Lion King” to be an animated feature despite nearly the entire film being computer animated. It is considered a live-action remake, according to the company. Otherwise, it would be the highest-grossing animated feature, as it collected more than $1.6 billion during its theatrical run.

NBC_20,"With Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Democrats eye a VP pick who can win over blue-collar voters",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kentucky-gov-andy-beshear-democrats-vp-pick-kamala-harris-rcna163115,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"Even if not directly stated, Andy Beshear knew why he was on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"": an audition. 
About halfway through an 11-minute interview Monday morning, the 48-year-old Kentucky governor, who comes from the state's political royalty, seamlessly turned his attention to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who last week was picked as Donald Trump’s running mate. 
“I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, because let me tell you, JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said.
Beshear’s jab was no accident. 
Vance’s selection last week was viewed, in part, through the lens of geography. He is from a small, poverty-stricken town in Ohio and seen as someone who could solidify the Trump campaign in key swaths of the Midwest and Pennsylvania. 
After President Joe Biden made the historic decision to get out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s likely nominee and started the process of picking a running mate. Her shortlist includes several white governors from politically important states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and Beshear.
Unlike the others, Beshear’s red-hued state is most likely not in play in 2024. The two-term red-state governor, though, won re-election last year in a state Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2020. He also won by 22 percentage points in the eastern Kentucky county that Vance referenced in his Republican National Convention speech, a county Trump claimed by 52 points in 2020. In a region where Democrats are still fighting for votes, he is seen as someone with a bipartisan reputation who can serve as a counterbalance to Vance. 
“People know that he is someone who can communicate and be trusted by voters that aren’t always in the Democratic column,” a Kentucky Democratic strategist said.
Follow live updates on the 2024 election
Vance has since directly responded to the line of attack, seemingly to acknowledge that he understands that if Beshear is the pick, it will likely be a showdown between the two over who can best flex their blue-collar bona fides. 
“Eastern Kentucky will always have a special place in my heart,” Vance told reporters. “It’s very weird to have a guy whose first job was at his dad’s law firm and inherited the governorship from his father criticize my origin story.” 
Democrats who have long worked in Kentucky Democratic politics say that not only does Beshear’s rural roots help him, but coming from a red state should not be a political burden to overcome.
“I don’t think so,” said a veteran Kentucky Democrat granted anonymity to talk freely about the state’s governor. “Look at vice presidential picks in recent memory, and I don’t think geography or location were huge. I think it has to do more with personality characteristics and chemistry.”
“He has put in the work, he can exercise bipartisanship, and can reach a whole swath of people Democrats traditionally cannot,” the person added. 
Some Republicans in the state, meanwhile, have been left scratching their heads because Beshear is not going to put his home state in play for Democrats.
“What does he bring to the ticket? That’s what confuses me,” said Tres Watson, a Republican political strategist and founder of Capitol Reins PR, who also served as the communications director for the Kentucky Republican Party. “You know, other than being a white guy. Kentucky is not in play.”
Among the people Harris is considering as her running mate, Beshear has been one of the most public surrogates. He has done a number of national cable interviews and already shown a comfort in framing his own record and attacking Vance. 
The general response, to date, from Republicans, has focused on some version of Beshear not truly being a man of the working class because his family has been involved in Kentucky politics for decades. His dad, Steve, is a former two-term governor, and Andy Beshear served as the state’s attorney general before being elected  governor himself in 2019.
Republican Party of Kentucky Communications Director Andy Westberry also amplified Beshear’s background, something that has been consistent fodder on the party’s social media accounts in recent days. 
“He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth,” he said. “His story is one of privilege right out of the gate, as opposed to JD Vance who no one ever gave anything to. He has succeeded on his own.”
Beshear's backers argue that his background has not affected his ability to connect with voters in a state that, on paper, should not agree with the governor's politics, something that would make him a value add to Harris' ticket. 
John Rabinowitz, a lawyer whom Beshear appointed as chair of the state’s horse-racing commission, agreed with the idea that Kentucky would be hard to win for Democrats, but he said Beshear’s ability to speak the language of the region could prove invaluable throughout the Midwest and Appalachia. 
“There is probably not a more relatable person in the South or Midwest,” he said. “There has to be an appeal for that.”
Former Democratic Kentucky state Sen. Ed Worley said Beshear also brings considerable political talent to the table, including the ability  to raise campaign cash from a sizable network in a state not always thought of for its deep-pocketed donors.
“He looks the part. He looks like a vice presidential candidate,” Worley said. “He is well educated and has the capacity to raise big money and play across the aisle.”
Much of his donor network was built over decades, Worley said.
“The governor comes from a very political family,” he added. “I don’t think one family can have four terms as governor without the substantial capacity to raise money.”
Beshear holds a 65% approval rating in his state, according to a Morning Consult tracking survey published Wednesday, which makes him the second most popular governor in the country, behind Vermont Republican Phil Scott.
Beshear has also survived as a Democrat in GOP state by at times not campaigning on key Biden administration achievements that could be seen as unpopular with Republicans. During his re-election bid in 2023, Republicans tried to hit him with the moniker the ""Biden-Beshear"" agenda, but it didn't stick in part because that's not how he ran.
During that race, Biden didn't endorse or make any trips to Kentucky, and Beshear focused on less partisan fights like infrastructure and the cost of living.
But could Harris pick a governor who did not publicly embrace top policies passed by an administration of which she was a key figure?
""It's a good question,"" Rabinowitz said. ""He will tell you he is a proud Democrat, but he also always comes back to doing what he thinks is right for the state of Kentucky.""
Supporters also say that Beshear has been able to thread the political needle in a Republican-heavy state by responding well to a series of devastating natural disasters, including 2022 flooding in the southeast portions of the state that left 38 people dead, and deadly tornadoes that ripped across the state last year.
“What you learn from something like that is, a disaster like that will take a man’s home whether they are Democrat or Republican,” Worley, the former state senator, said. “He led in those moments, and helped people get out whether they were Republican or Democrat.”
Beshear has, however, taken measures that weren't always popular on the right. 
As one of his first official acts after his 2019 win, Beshear ended a ban on voting for those with criminal convictions. The move restored an executive order signed in 2015 when his father was governor that was suspended by his father's successor, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
During the height of the pandemic, Beshear took a similar approach to many other Democratic governors, banning mass gatherings, shutting down schools and releasing inmates with medical conditions. Republicans fought his pandemic response and used it as a line of attack during his re-election bid.
But Beshear has also led the charge on legalized sports betting in the state, marijuana decriminalization and revamping the Brent Spence Bridge, to deliver on what the Kentucky Democratic strategist said “no one ever thought would get done.” It was during his work on decriminalization that Beshear and Harris got to know each other better.
Beshear’s time in Frankfort, though, has not been without issue.
The Department of Justice is currently investigating the state’s juvenile justice system in the wake of an audit report that found ongoing problems. Federal investigators will probe whether Kentucky facilities appropriately protect juveniles from force by staff, as well as violence and sexual abuse, according to The Associated Press.
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told the AP that the investigation is to “ensure the children in Kentucky youth detention facilities are safe from harm.”
Beshear’s office said they are cooperating with federal authorities.
Beshear has also clashed with Kentucky’s legislative leadership, which currently holds supermajorities in both chambers.
Beshear has leaned into his bipartisan appeal as a red-state Democratic governor, saying on ""Morning Joe"" that the country needs to become more bipartisan, like his state has. 
“What we have done in Kentucky is what we need to do in this country,” he said. “Move beyond the partisanship and constant arguing. … We need to turn the temperature down.”
He has, however, had hyperpartisan clashes with Republican leaders, who have overridden dozens of Beshear vetoes over the years on issues like the budget and criminal justice reform, and one that would end the ability of Kentucky governors to make appointments to fill vacant U.S. Senate seats, according to the Kentucky Lantern.
“He likes to portray himself like Mr. Rogers, which is totally ridiculous. He comes from a very partisan family, and the first thing he did was go after JD Vance’s inspiring personal story,” GOP Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer said. “We have overridden more than 100 of his vetoes.”
“He works against us on so many things, then tries to take credit,” he added.Matt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.

NBC_21,Deputy who killed Sonya Massey worked for 6 agencies in 4 years,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deputy-killed-sonya-massey-worked-6-agencies-4-years-rcna163409,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"The former sheriff’s deputy charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Sonya Massey had been employed by six agencies since 2020, Illinois law enforcement records show. And he twice pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol before he began working in law enforcement, according to court records.
Sean Grayson was fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office last Wednesday, nearly two weeks after he shot and killed Massey in her home in Springfield, about 200 miles southwest of Chicago. 
Massey, 36, had called 911 to report a suspected prowler. Grayson and another deputy, who has not been identified, responded just before 1 a.m. on July 6. Grayson shot her in the head within seconds of demanding she drop a pot of water after she told him, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” body camera video released Monday shows. 
Massey was Black. Grayson is white. His employment history includes short stints as a part-time officer at three small police departments in Illinois.
NBC News has requested his personnel files from each agency, and has received responses from four so far. Records provided by those four departments do not include any complaints or disciplinary action against Grayson. All of the agencies he worked for are in central Illinois. 
Grayson worked part time at the Pawnee, Kincaid and Virden police departments, state records show, with his employment at Pawnee overlapping at times with both Kincaid and Virden. He worked full time at the Auburn Police Department and the sheriff’s departments in Logan and Sangamon counties.
DJ Mathon, the chief of the Kincaid Police Department, said Grayson worked there part time from Feb. 4 to May 18, 2021, and was let go by the Village of Kincaid Board when he refused to live within a 10-mile radius of the village. He maintained his employment at Pawnee, where he was hired in August 2020, during the entirety of his time at Kincaid and had asked for permission to take on the second job, records show. Mathon said the department did not have any written complaints against Grayson and no disciplinary actions were taken against him. 
Grayson was hired by the Virden Police Department shortly after leaving Kincaid, and while he was still working at Pawnee, at a rate of  $17.50 per hour, records obtained by NBC News show. He worked there part time for several months. The police department employs nine officers.  
The department said Grayson’s reason for leaving is unknown because it did not receive a resignation from him. An official from the department said that “he just stopped covering shifts.” His separation date was Dec. 31, 2021, though records show that he began working in Auburn months before. He wrote in the application for Auburn that he was leaving Virden because he wanted to be a full-time officer.
Grayson worked full time at the Auburn Police Department from July 2021 to May 2022, and then at the Logan County Sheriff’s Office for a little less than a year, before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office. 
In his letter of resignation from the Auburn Police Department, Grayson wrote that he “had nothing but a positive experience working as an officer.”
“I appreciate the opportunity you presented to me and I am sincerely grateful for everything you and this department has done for me,” he wrote. “I will take everything I have learned from you and this department and continue to learn and grow.”
Grayson received his part-time Law Enforcement Certification on June 5, 2021, according to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board. His certification status reads as suspended on the board’s website.
Before he worked in law enforcement, Grayson had been a wheeled vehicle mechanic in the U.S. Army from May 2014 to February 2016, Army spokesman Bryce Dubee said.
“He had no deployments and left the Army in the rank of private first class,” Dubee said in a statement. 
Court records show Grayson twice pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, in 2015 and in 2016. The 2015 arrest occurred during his enlistment. His past DUI arrests were disclosed in his application to the Auburn Police Department, records show. He also noted in that application that he at some point had had his license revoked or suspended.
Body camera footage shows that Grayson declined to render aid as Massey lay dying and had discouraged his partner from trying to save her. 
“The other deputy still rendered aid and stayed with Ms. Massey until medical help arrived,” a prosecutor wrote in court documents, adding that Grayson “at no time attempted to render aid to Ms. Massey.”
Grayson, 30, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct charges. He is being detained without bond. 
Last week, after the Illinois State Police concluded its investigation into the shooting, as required by state law, the sheriff’s office said Grayson was fired because the investigation had made it clear that he “did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards.”
Sangamon County State’s Attorney John Milhiser said a review of the  state police’s investigation, including the body-worn camera footage, “does not support a finding that Deputy Sean Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force.”
The fatal shooting has drawn comments from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Justice Department said it “is aware of and assessing the circumstances” surrounding it. The Justice Department said it “will continue to track the criminal case opened by the Sangamon County State’s Attorney.”Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing."
NBC_22,American hostage families' message for Netanyahu in D.C. meeting: Bring them home now,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gaza-hostages-netanyahu-hersh-goldberg-polin-hamas-israel-rcna163325,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"American families of hostages held by Hamas for nearly 300 days had a clear and direct message for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his high-stakes visit to the United States: Bring them home now.  
“There is an opportunity right now, and we must seize this opportunity,” Jon Polin, whose son is in captivity, told NBC News on Tuesday. “We’re not going to stop pushing. We need to get this done.”
Netanyahu, who has faced mounting pressure from hostage families, as well as from the international community, to strike a deal with Hamas for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, met this week with families of five Israeli Americans held by the militant group that runs the besieged enclave. 
The visit took place in Washington before Netanyahu’s scheduled address to Congress on Wednesday and a meeting with President Joe Biden on Thursday.
According to several of the American hostage families in Washington for the Netanyahu speech and meetings, they are upset that he is in the United States instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. They also said they are looking toward Thursday's joint meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Biden to pressure the Israeli leader to agree to a cease-fire deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles.   
Netanyahu's trip comes at a time of political upheaval in Israel as well as in the U.S., with the trip coming on the heels of the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, as well as Biden’s announcement that he will not seek re-election and his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the de facto Democratic nominee.
Meanwhile in Israel, protests have rocked the country amid mounting calls for Netanyahu to focus on striking a cease-fire deal, with an announcement this week from the Israeli military that two more hostages held in Gaza have died, with at least 46 people believed to be dead in Hamas' captivity, fueling outrage.He is also under huge pressure from the military, the intelligence and a majority of the Israeli public to wind the war down and agree to a cease-fire.
Netanyahu has additionally faced growing isolation on the international stage over his handling of the war in Gaza, where the death toll continues to rise, with more than 39,000 people killed, according to local health officials. Israel launched its offensive after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has come under intense international pressure over its handling of the war in Gaza as images of civilian death and suffering continue to emerge from the bombed-out region, with about 90% of the population internally displaced.
Tens of thousands of sheltering Palestinians were forced to evacuate Khan Younis in southern Gaza this week following orders from the Israeli military as it launched an aerial assault on the area.
It comes after the United Nations’ top court said last week that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories was unlawful and ordered its immediate end. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes, which he denies. 
Hostage families have frequently appealed to Biden, a staunch and longtime supporter of Israel, to aid their cause of seeing their loved ones freed, which many have accused Netanyahu of putting second behind defeating Hamas.
“What we were hoping and are still hoping to hear tomorrow is, ‘Thank you to the United States for helping us get this deal over the finish line,’” Polin said Tuesday.Details of a deal are still being worked out but could include a six-week cease-fire and the release of hostages in three stages, Biden said in May. 
If a three-stage deal materializes, Polin’s son Hersh Goldberg-Polin could be among first to be released because he was injured. He was recorded on video being loaded onto a pickup truck at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, with his arm blown off in Hamas' attack.
Goldberg-Polin is among some 120 hostages who remain held captive by Hamas, which is designated a terror group by the U.S. and European Union. Appearing on NBC News, his parents wore the number 291, representing the number of days he’s been missing, written in black marker and taped onto their shirts.
“It might take some time, but every one of these 120 people has to come home,” said Polin’s wife, Rachel Goldberg-Polin.
Daniel Neutra's family was among several who met with national security leaders on Monday to discuss a potentially imminent cease-fire deal. 
Neutra said the last time he spoke with his older brother Omer was Oct. 6. Omer, who grew up in the U.S. and served in the Israeli army, was looking forward to spending a weekend with friends, Neutra said. He was taken captive hours later.
“I agree with people calling for a cease-fire,” Neutra said. “All the death has to end.”
Neutra’s parents recently shared Omer’s story at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, but Neutra said both Biden and Harris have been unequivocal in their support of the five American Israeli hostages. 
“People are dying all the time in captivity, and we can’t continue this process on their backs,” he said. “We need to finish this right now.” 
If Netanyahu was expecting an easy visit to the U.S. capital, he will not necessarily get it, said former hostage Aviva Siegel, who was held for 51 days and lost more than 20 pounds during captivity. She worries Netanyahu is more concerned with wiping out Hamas than with securing the release of hostages, including her husband of 43 years.
Siegel supports a cease-fire. “Of course I do,” she said. “It should have happened a long time ago.”
Siegel last received proof of life in April when Hamas released a video of her husband. She has not heard from him since. Every day is agony, she said. 
“I need him and he needs me,” she said.
Other families said they were hopeful that Netanyahu’s visit would signal an imminent hostage deal. 
Senior U.S. officials told NBC News last month that the Biden administration had discussed potentially negotiating a unilateral deal with Hamas to release the American hostages if current cease-fire talks involving Israel failed.
Adi Alexander, whose son Edan was taken while serving in the Israeli army, said securing a deal now could bolster Netanyahu’s reputation and cement Biden’s legacy.
“It could be a turning point, but I felt like that back in January and back in the end of April,” he said, referring to previous hostage negotiations. “Now we have the third round, and I’m just hoping it won’t collapse.”Alicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws."

Meer Patel, 23, of Murfreesboro, was arrested and charged with theft of over $250,000, the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Monday. The customer, an Antioch father, was informed of his winnings and has since collected the prize.
""The feel-good side of this story is the [man] never knew he was the winner until we made contact with him,"" Detective Lt. Steve Craig said. ""That is absolutely life-changing money.""
The man, who told authorities he did not want to be identified, purchased two tickets at a Shell gas station on July 13. Both tickets were winners: one for $1 million and the other for a lesser amount, the sheriff's office said.
After buying the tickets, the man handed them to Patel, who paid him the lesser amount and allegedly tossed the $1 million ticket in the trash.
Store video obtained by investigators from the Tennessee Lottery showed Patel allegedly taking the ticket out of the trash and placing it in his pocket after the man left, authorities said.""Mr. Patel is then seen later in the video celebrating in the store after scratching off the front of the ticket and learning it was a $1 million winner,"" Detective Dennis Ward said.
He allegedly then tried to claim the $1 million prize with the Tennessee Lottery but was stopped from collecting it after employees became suspicious.
Craig said the video from the store helped authorities find the lucky man, who was surprised he had won.

NBC_24,Man who attacked author Salman Rushdie charged with supporting terrorist group,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-attacked-author-salman-rushdie-charged-supporting-terrorist-group-rcna163451,2024-07-25 00:00:19.122200,,"BUFFALO, N.Y. — A man who severely injured author Salman Rushdie in a frenzied knife attack in western New York faces a new charge that he supported a terrorist group.
An indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo on Wednesday charges Hadi Matar with providing material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The indictment didn’t detail what evidence linked Matar to the group.
The federal charge comes after Matar earlier this month rejected an offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he agreed to plead guilty in Chautauqua County Court, where he is charged with attempted murder and assault. The agreement also would have required him to plead guilty to a federal terrorism-related charge, which hadn’t been filed yet at the time.
Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.
Matar’s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment.
Matar, 26, has been held without bail since the 2022 attack, during which he stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times as the acclaimed writer was onstage about to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution. Knife wounds blinded Rushdie in one eye. The event moderator, Henry Reese, was also wounded.
Rushdie detailed the attack and his long and painful recovery in a memoir published in April.
The author spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa, or edict, in 1989 calling for Rushdie’s death over his novel “The Satanic Verses.” Khomeini considered the book blasphemous. Rushdie reemerged into the public the late 1990s.
Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. He lived in New Jersey prior to the attack. His mother has said that her son became withdrawn and moody after he visited his father in Lebanon in 2018.
The attack raised questions about whether Rushdie had gotten proper security protection, given that he is still the subject of death threats. A state police trooper and county sheriff’s deputy had been assigned to the lecture. In 1991, a Japanese translator of “The Satanic Verses” was stabbed to death. An Italian translator survived a knife attack the same year. In 1993, the book’s Norwegian publisher was shot three times but survived.

“Didi,” which opens in select theaters Friday, follows Bay Area teen Chris Wang, a Taiwanese American kid played by Izaac Wang. He’s seeking belonging and acceptance from school peers and the local skate scene, and his social struggles in part touch on a common experience among kids of immigrants, Oscar-nominated director Sean Wang said. Without parents who can usher him into American culture, Chris is left contending with an unspoken cultural gap between him and the rest of their peers. 
“Your parents are immigrants and they’re not like ‘OK, now listen to the Rolling Stones.’ They didn’t show me the Beatles but people were talking about the Beatles … My parents didn’t show me ‘Jaws’,” Wang said. “I had to go watch that myself because I clearly needed to figure this cultural stuff out. And I think that’s what I wanted to capture in the movie.” 
In the film, angsty teen Chris — affectionately called “Didi,” which translates to “little brother” in Chinese, by his family members and “Wang Wang” by friends — enters the nascent stages of adolescence in the last month before high school. There’s a cultural gulf between Chris and his immigrant mother, and his father is noticeably absent, away on business abroad. He’s thrown into the era of early Facebook and the Myspace top 8 all on his own. And it’s hard. His friendships change as his buddies treat him like an afterthought, he’s unsure of how to handle interactions with his crush, Madi, and life in his immigrant household is tense. 
Chris becomes plagued with loneliness and a lack of self-confidence. He attempts to seek community with other skaters, but his insecurities only lead him to more severed relationships. 
“everyoen hates me and I have no freinds left,” he writes at one point to famed AIM chatbot SmarterChild. 
At times, Chris’ social woes are amplified by the lack of cultural references he has. During some of his interactions with Madi, he’s left scrambling to read up on movies she enjoys or brush off his cluelessness with humor. The semi-autobiographical film hits on a familiar emotion for Wang.
“People were like, ‘Isn’t it interesting that he’s like the filmmaker kid and hasn’t seen these movies?’” Wang recalled his peers saying of him. 
The time period of the film is also a factor into Chris’ loneliness. Wang explained that in the 2008 cultural landscape, one dominated by the pop punk scene and MTV, Asian Americans barely had any cultural currency. 
“You’re surrounded by people who look like you but the culture says you’re not cool. Society says you’re not cool,” Wang said. “So what does that do to your sense of self as a 13-year-old Asian kid? You’re like, ‘OK, well, I guess they’re right.” 
Wang said that while the film subtly conveys the idea, a deleted scene gets at the era’s desert of Asian American representation. 
“There was actually a scene that we ended up cutting, and it was the kids basically talking about that,” Wang said. “They’re like, ‘Name one cool Asian.’ They couldn’t think of anyone. And they were like, ‘I don’t know. Tila Tequila?’ She was like that one Asian representation back then.”
Being around other Asian American families still doesn’t shield from those feelings of “otherness,” Wang explained. 
“Growing up with a multicultural community, I still felt that shame,” Wang said. “I remember back then people would say to me, ‘Dude, I don’t even see you as Asian.’ Those are all ‘compliments.’ … The shame — you realize how it’s a little insidious. You don’t even realize you’re feeling it. And it’s a little bit of that cultural erasure.” 
Some of the most powerful moments in the film follow Chris’ relationship with his mother Chungsing, a gentle spirit with creative aspirations, played by Joan Chen. There’s no micromanaging Chris’ teen life, and yet, he still oozes embarrassment when she’s around. Wang said that Chungsing mirrors many real-life Asian American parents he saw growing up who bucked the stereotypical “Tiger mom” trope. 
“I wanted to try to showcase the flip side of the coin, which was immigrant mothers … that were a little bit more soft spoken and sensitive and artistic and empathetic,” Wang said. 
But just because a parent-child dynamic doesn’t involve strict rules or academic pressure, it  doesn’t mean it’s not still one with conflict, he explained. Chris is still wracked with shame and embarrassment around his mom. 
“The conflict that arises in the movie is not because Chris is not a model child, even though it’s part of it, but it’s that … immigrant chasm and the generational gap.”
The film, a yearslong project, prompted Wang to unpack his relationship with his own mother in an objective way, he said.
“Part of that whole experience was getting to know my parents in a way that was more deep and meaningful and closing the gap between mother and son,” he said. “Closing that gap for myself. It made the movie … a lot more rich and fulfilling.” Kimmy Yam is a reporter for NBC Asian America."
NBC_26,FBI director reveals new details on how Trump shooter carried out attack,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-director-christopher-wray-provides-new-insights-trump-shooting-inv-rcna163432,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"The gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump may have had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to carry and conceal the weapon, the director of the FBI testified Wednesday.
The gunman also had researched President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray said.
On July 5, Thomas Crooks, 20, traveled to the site of Trump's July 13 presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, for the first time, Wray told a House Judiciary Committee hearing.
The next day, Crooks searched “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,"" referring to the 1963 assassination, and registered for the rally, Wray said.
A series of Congressional hearings this week have begun to shed light on how Crooks was able to evade law enforcement and open fire at Trump. Wray’s testimony has offered the most clear timeline of Crooks’ activities on the day of the shooting and in the week leading up to it, highlighting the level of preparation carried out ahead of time. 
On the morning of the rally, he went back to the campaign site, where he stayed for about an hour, and then left to purchase 50 rounds of ammunition that afternoon. 
Wray said Crooks was back at the rally site shortly before 4 p.m., when he flew a drone about 200 yards away from the main stage area, Wray said.
Two hours later, witnesses began to shout about a suspicious man on the roof of a nearby building. 
Wray said Crooks may have had a collapsible stock, which would explain why witnesses did not see Crooks walking around with a weapon beforehand and why the firearm was not spotted until Crooks was already on the roof. 
Crooks began firing at least eight gunshots seconds after he noticed a local law enforcement officer on the ground had spotted him, Wray said.
The officer had gotten a boost from a colleague and pulled his head up over the roof. Crooks pointed his gun at the officer, causing him to fall, and then started shooting at Trump, Wray said.
The FBI still does not know Crooks’ motive. Wray said it has been frustrating that the investigation has not “yielded significant clues.”
He said investigators have seen “indications,” however, that Crooks was interested in public figures and that Crooks grew “very focused” on Trump and the rally about a week before  July 13.
The FBI director's testimony comes amid frustrations from lawmakers that key questions have remained unanswered, particularly by Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned as director of the Secret Service on Tuesday after Republicans accused her of failing to fully cooperate with the House Oversight Committee in testimony the day before.
“We need to know play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray on Wednesday at the start of the hearing.
Wray said the FBI recovered the drone in Crooks’ car, where they also found a drone controller and two explosive devices that could be remotely detonated.
Crooks had a transmitter on him, the director said, adding that it appears the remote detonation “would not have worked.”
Eight bullet cartridges were found on the roof with the gunman’s body, he said.
Wray said Crooks had purchased a ladder, about 5-foot tall, according to a bloodied receipt that he had on him, but the ladder was not found at the scene. The FBI director said it is unclear how Crooks got onto the roof.
Crooks was a ""fairly avid shooting hobbyist,"" who went to a shooting range the day before the assassination attempt, ""probably"" with the same AR-style rifle he used at the rally, Wray said.
On Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit had spotted Crooks from a second-story window and left their post to search for him.
Paris said Crooks was identified as suspicious before the shooting because he was hanging around but never attempted to enter the rally. That suspicion was later heightened, Paris said, when Crooks was seen with a rangefinder.
That day, three other people had been identified as suspicious, the state police commissioner said. 
Crooks was not designated as an actual threat until seconds before he opened fire, Paris said. Trump was shot in the ear, one rallygoer was killed and two others were wounded.Melissa Chan is a reporter for NBC News Digital with a focus on veterans’ issues, mental health in the military and gun violence."
NBC_27,Georgia denies state funding to teach AP Black studies classes,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgia-denies-state-funding-teach-ap-black-studies-classes-rcna163402,2024-07-24 23:00:19.122200,,"Georgia is refusing to provide state funding for the new Advanced Placement course in African American Studies, so some school districts have cancelled plans to teach the course to high schoolers.
Advocates complain that the decision by Georgia’s elected school superintendent will suppress teaching about Black history, just like officials did in Florida, Arkansas and some other places.
“The fact that AP African American studies was removed from our schools is alarming and an injustice to our students who eagerly anticipated taking this course,” state Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Democrat from Lilburn, said in a statement. “Erasure of black history from our schools is not and never will be okay!”
The State Board of Education, appointed by the governor, must approve a class for it to be eligible for state funding, which helps pay for a teacher’s salary and class materials. Superintendent Richard Woods decided he won’t recommend approval of the class to the board, but didn’t say why.
“Superintendent Woods has opted not to recommend this course for state approval at this time,” Meghan Frick, a spokesperson for the state Department of Education, wrote in an emailed statement.
Local districts can still pay for the AP course out of their own funds, Frick said. The state isn’t denying credit toward high school graduation if they do. Frick also noted that Georgia funds a state-designed African American Studies course approved in 2020. That course doesn’t qualify for AP credit.
The AP course drew national scrutiny in 2023 when Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, preparing for his presidential run, said he would ban the course in his state because it pushed a political agenda.
In Arkansas, state officials have said the course will count for credit in the coming school year. They denied such credit last year, saying it wasn’t yet clear that the AP course would comply with a state law restricting how race can be taught. Six schools taught the pilot course anyway.
Some individual school districts around the country have also declined to offer the course.
As conservative criticism mounted, The College Board removed several topics from the exam, including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer life, and was criticized for bowing to political pressure.
A later set of changes includes more material on topics including the Tulsa Race Massacre; Black culture’s influence on film and sports; and discriminatory practices related to housing, known as redlining. This framework is being used as the course officially launches in the school year that’s about to begin.
The College Board, a nonprofit testing entity, offers AP courses across the academic spectrum, including in math, science, social studies, foreign languages and fine arts. The courses are optional and taught at a college level. Students who score well on a final exam can usually earn college credit.
There has been little public discussion in Georgia of the African American Studies course. But in 2022, Georgia lawmakers passed a ban on teaching divisive racial concepts in schools, prohibiting claims that the U.S. is “fundamentally or systematically racist,” or that any people are “inherently racist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.” No one “should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress because of his or her race,” says this measure, which was based on a now-repealed executive order from President Donald Trump that was hotly opposed by Democrats and liberal groups.
Sara Sympson, a spokesperson for the College Board, said 33 Georgia schools piloted the course in 2023-2024. Some of those schools assumed they would be offering the finalized version of the course this year.
Georgia’s refusal to approve the course came to light Monday when the state’s largest school district, Gwinnett County in suburban Atlanta, issued a memo saying it was scrapping plans to teach the course at six high schools. Schedules for 240 students will have to change before classes begin on Aug. 5.
“We are committed to offering a comprehensive and inclusive education for each and every student,” Gwinnett County superintendent Calvin Watts said in a statement. “The 2023-24 AP African American Studies pilot was successful, and we are disappointed that students will neither have the opportunity to take, nor to receive credit for this innovative college-level course.”
In DeKalb County, another Atlanta suburb, rising senior Daniel Herrera was among the students pushing for the AP class to be offered at Dunwoody High School. He blamed the cancellation on a “conservatively dominated” Georgia Department of Education.
“I think it’s essential for students to remember everybody’s history equally,” Herrera said.
Angela Williams Pitkonen, who would have taught the class at Dunwoody, said 100 students had signed up, as many as typically sign up for AP World History.
“There’s no reason to not offer this class,” Pitkonen said. “This class is not a class that’s designed to make white students feel guilty; it’s not a class designed to make Black students feel ashamed.” Instead, she argued that it would teach understanding and empathy.
“I think the old guard may be uncomfortable with the level of empathy they are seeing in their children and their grandchildren,” Pitkonen said.

NBC_28,"A twice-yearly injection offers 100% protection against HIV, study suggests",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hiv-injection-twice-yearly-offers-protection-rcna163406,2024-07-24 23:00:19.122200,,"Twice-yearly shots used to treat AIDS were 100% effective in preventing new infections in women, according to study results published Wednesday.
There were no infections in the young women and girls that got the shots in a study of about 5,000 in South Africa and Uganda, researchers reported. In a group given daily prevention pills, roughly 2% ended up catching HIV from infected sex partners.
“To see this level of protection is stunning,” said Salim Abdool Karim of the injections. He is director of an AIDS research center in Durban, South Africa, who was not part of the research.
The shots made by U.S. drugmaker Gilead and sold as Sunlenca are approved in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere, but only as a treatment for HIV. The company said it is waiting for results of testing in men before seeking permission to use it to protect against infection.
The results in women were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at an AIDS conference in Munich. Gilead paid for the study and some of the researchers are company employees. Because of the surprisingly encouraging results, the study was stopped early and all participants were offered the shots, also known as lenacapavir.
While there are other ways to prevent HIV infection, like condoms or daily pills, consistent use has been a problem in Africa. In the new study, only about 30% of participants given Gilead’s Truvada or Descovy prevention pills actually took them — and that figure dropped over time.
The prospect of a twice-a-year shot is “quite revolutionary news” for our patients, said Thandeka Nkosi, who helped run the Gilead research at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Masiphumelele, South Africa. “It gives participants a choice and it just eliminates the whole stigma around taking pills” to prevent HIV.
Experts working to stop the spread of AIDS are excited about the Sunlenca shots but are concerned Gilead hasn’t yet agreed on an affordable price for those who need them the most. The company said it would pursue a “voluntary licensing program,” suggesting that only a select number of generic producers would be allowed to make them.
“Gilead has a tool that could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic,” said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the Geneva-based U.N. AIDS agency.
She said her organization urged Gilead to share Sunlenca’s patent with a U.N.-backed program that negotiates broad contracts allowing generic drugmakers to make cheap versions of drugs for poorer countries worldwide. As an HIV treatment, the drug costs more than $40,000 a year in the U.S., although what individuals pay varies.
Dr. Helen Bygrave of Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the injections could “reverse the epidemic if it is made available in the countries with the highest rate of new infections.” She urged Gilead to publish a price for Sunlenca that would be affordable for all countries.
In a statement last month, Gilead said it was too early to say how much Sunlenca would cost for prevention in poorer countries. Dr. Jared Baeten, Gilead’s senior vice president of clinical development, said the company was already talking to generics manufacturers and understood how “deeply important it is that we move at speed.”
Another HIV prevention shot, Apretude, which is given every two months, is approved in some countries, including in Africa. It sells for about $180 per patient per year, which is still too pricey for most developing countries.
Byanyima said the people who need long-lasting protection the most include women and girls who are victims of domestic violence and gay men in countries where same-sex relationships are criminalized. According to UNAIDS, 46% of new HIV infections globally in 2022 were in women and girls, who were three times more likely to get HIV than males in Africa.
Byanyima compared the news about Sunlenca to the discovery decades ago of AIDS drugs that could turn HIV infection from a death sentence into a chronic illness. Back then, South African President Nelson Mandela suspended patents to allow wider access to the drugs; the price later dropped from about $10,000 per patient per year to about $50.
Olwethu Kemele, a health worker at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation, predicted the shots could boost the number of people coming in for HIV prevention and slow the virus’ spread. She said young women often hide the pills to avoid questions from boyfriends and family members. “It makes it hard for the girls to continue,” she said.
In a report on the state of the global epidemic released this week, UNAIDS said that fewer people were infected with HIV in 2023 than at any point since the late 1980s. Globally, HIV infects about 1.3 million people every year and kills more than 600,000, mainly in Africa. While significant progress has been made in Africa, HIV infections are rising in Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.
In other research presented at the AIDS conference, Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool and colleagues estimated that once production of Sunlenca is expanded to treat 10 million people, the price should fall to about $40 per treatment. He said it was critical that health authorities get access to Sunlenca as soon as possible.
“This is about as close as you can get to an HIV vaccine,” he said.The Associated Press"

""We have shown Disney that we are the true magic makers of the park and today proves that when workers stand together for what they deserve, we win,"" the Disney Workers Rising Bargaining Committee said in a statement. ""We look forward to making our voices heard during the voting process to ratify this contract.""
The bargaining committee said details of the tentative agreement would be shared with union members before a formal vote on Monday. The results of that vote will then be shared with the public. 
The announcement of a tentative deal comes five days after union members voted to authorize a strike by an overwhelming majority, citing alleged unfair labor practices during contract negotiations. 
The number of employees who voted was not released. The unions said that, of the members who participated, 99% voted to approve a walkout.
In a statement, Disneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good said: ""We care deeply about the wellbeing of our cast members and are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with [the unions] that addresses what matters most to our cast while positioning Disneyland Resort for future growth and job creation.""
The employees covered by the contract include custodians, ride operators, candymakers and merchandise clerks at the popular theme park, a pillar of the tourism economy in Southern California. In company parlance, theme park workers are known as ""cast members.""
The bargaining committee previously accused Disney of having ""engaged in multiple instances of conduct we allege are unfair labor practices, including unlawful discipline and intimidation and surveillance of union members exercising their right to wear union buttons at work.""
The union buttons in question depict a Mickey Mouse-style white glove raised in a fist. (The company has insisted that costumes worn by cast members are ""a critical part of enhancing the experience of our Disney show."")
In recent years, labor leaders and scholars have drawn public attention to the economic struggles of employees at Disneyland and other major theme parks across the country.
In an internal survey of union members conducted earlier this year, 28% of Disneyland cast members reported experiencing food insecurity, 33% reported experiencing housing insecurity in the last year, and 42% reported needing to miss work for medical treatment because they did not have enough sick leave.
The four unions that represent the workers are the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers (BCTGM) Local 83; the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW); the Teamsters Local 495; and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 324.
The last time Disneyland was hit with a strike was September 1984, when nearly 2,000 cast members walked off the job for 22 days.
The pre-existing contract for cast members at Disneyland expired June 16. The contract for cast members at Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney expires Sept. 30.Daniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News."

In the U.S., wildfires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington, illuminating skies with bright orange flames and haze.
In Oregon, the Durkee fire shut down Interstate 84 in the eastern part of the state in both directions Tuesday between Ontario and Baker City, the state’s Department of Transportation said, warning: “The fire is advancing rapidly towards the highway in multiple locations in the Farewell Bend area.” 
The Durkee fire, the current largest wildfire in Oregon, was discovered the morning of July 17, sparked by lightning, and has since burned through over 239,000 acres and as of Wednesday is 0% contained. 
Level three evacuations are in the place in Baker and Malheur counties due to the Durkee and Cow Valley fires, with the whole town of Huntington, home to about 510 people, under level three evacuation, according to NBC affiliate KTVB of Boise, Idaho. An estimated 3,472 people are in the level 3 evacuation, meaning there’s extreme danger and locals should leave immediately. There's currently 115 active fires in the state, according to the state's wildfire tracker.
In Washington, a fire sparked Monday near Naches led to mandatory evacuations, another burning near Bickelton also led to evacuations and threatened a natural gas plant, and a blaze that sparked Tuesday closed a section of U.S. Route 12, according to The Associated Press.
In California, the Apache fire sparked Tuesday evening near Highway 33 and Apache Canyon Road in Ventura County in the Los Padres National Forest. The blaze, estimated to be 250 acres, led the county to order evacuations for residences on Apache Canyon Road, local fire officials said.
The U.S. Forest Service said Tuesday that millions of acres of national forest lands across Oregon and Washington are “continuing to see record breaking dry timber conditions,” coupled with lightning storms, that spurs “rapid wildfire growth.” 
Officials said the Fremont-Winema and Deschutes national forests in Oregon have surpassed 75 days without wetting rains, and 45 days without wetting rain ""is widespread across the Pacific Northwest.""
Adding to conditions, much of the West has been hard hit with scorching temperatures in a prolonged heat wave the past few months.
“This is shaping up to be another monster fire year in the Pacific Northwest, and it’s just mid-July,” Ed Hiatt, Pacific Northwest assistant fire director for operations, said. He said that the agency is at Preparedness Level 5 — ""the highest level of wildfire response possible in the region and nation.""
“Crews, dozers, helicopters, and incident management teams from across the nation are coming to help including folks from as far away as North Carolina and Wisconsin,” Hiatt added.
In Canada, the alpine town of Jasper and the popular Jasper National Park in the province of Alberta were evacuated as multiple wildfires blazed in the park.
The critical red alert to evacuate was issued late Monday evening warning of a wildfire south of the town. 
“Everyone in Jasper must evacuate now,” the alert said, with orders to clear out the town in a matter of five hours by 3 a.m. Tuesday.
In total about 25,000 people, including park visitors and locals fled. About 10,000 people, including seasonal workers, were in Jasper at the time of the alert. Parks Canada estimated about 15,000 were in the park, the largest national park in the Canadian rockies, according to the AP. 
Evacuees were ordered to go to Grande Prairie, Calgary or Edmonton, where reception centers were waiting to provide support.
Jasper National Park said in an update Tuesday night: “The evacuation of the townsite is complete, and the evacuation of hikers in the backcountry is ongoing.”
The town and park have mobilized “all available resources” to support firefighting and protecting the town. Efforts include installing structure protection sprinklers and hose lines throughout the community, aerial suppression and a specialized train water tank along the train line. Visitors who made reservations through Aug. 6 will be fully refunded, Parks Canada said.
The park said a North Wildfire, between the Transfer Station and the Jasper Air Strip on both sides of Highway 16, has burned through a minimum estimated area of 270 hectares, or 667 acres, and a South Wildfire, near the Kerkeslin campground has burned an estimated 6750 hectares, or 16,680 acres.
Officials have not said when locals and visitors may return yet. 
Overall Alberta has 175 active wildfires burning across the province, according to a government tracker. The Alberta Emergency Management agency said since Jan. 1 there have been 940 wildfires in the Forest Protection Area burning more than 535,000 hectares or 1.3 million acres — 56 classified as out of control, 50 as held, 61 as under control and 770 extinguished. Lightning has caused more than half of the wildfires burning today, but the other half were caused by people, the agency said. 
The smoke from the wildfires have brought hazy skies and unhealthy air quality to parts of North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.Breaking News Reporter"
NBC_31,King Charles' monarchy gets a $60M pay rise as the U.K. grapples with a cost of living crisis,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/king-charles-royal-family-pay-rise-sovereign-grant-crown-estate-rcna163379,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"LONDON — King Charles III's monarchy is set to receive a pay rise of more than 45 million pounds ($60 million), with a 53% jump in its official annual income, accounts show, as Britain grapples with a spiraling cost of living crisis.  
The Sovereign Grant, the mechanism used to fund royal spending, will rise from over 86 million pounds ($110 million) in 2024-25 to around 132 million pounds ($170 million) in 2025-26, because of a surge in profits from the Crown Estate, a vast collection of land and property across the U.K. 
Funded by the taxpayer, the Sovereign Grant is used to support the official duties of the monarch and other costs such as official travel, thousands of engagements, staff for working royals and the maintenance of occupied palaces.
It is based on a proportion of profits from the Crown Estate, which is independently run and has assets worth billions of pounds, including some of London’s most expensive real estate.  
A separate report from the Crown Estate on Wednesday showed that it had generated profits of 1.1 billion pounds, or $1.4 billion. 
The Sovereign Grant is funded by the taxpayer in exchange for the king’s surrender of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The royal household had been receiving 25% of the Crown Estate’s profits until it was agreed last year that the funding would be cut to 12%. 
But it will still receive a significant boost in funding for 2025-26, largely due to Crown Estate profits. The report said it had seen a “year of record results driven by decades of investment in offshore wind, combined with a diverse and resilient property and land portfolio.”
Part of the funding increase will help finance the final stages of a 10-year, 369 million pound ($475 million) “reservicing” of Buckingham Palace, a project that is now in its eighth year, said the annual report about the Sovereign Grant, published Tuesday. 
The king also installed solar panels at Windsor Castle and increased the use of sustainable aviation fuel for royal flights. The royal household will take delivery of two new helicopters in the coming year to replace aging aircraft, it said, noting that their use was a “key component of delivering engagements by His Majesty, as Head of Nation, and other members of the Royal Family.”
The grant is reviewed every five years, and is expected to next be reviewed through legislation in 2026-27 to keep funding for the royal family at an “appropriate” level.
In addition, the king receives income via the Privy Purse from the Duchy of Lancaster, a landed estate, while the Prince of Wales receives the net profits from the Duchy of Cornwall.
Both are independently audited, according to a research briefing on the finances of the monarchy published last week on the British House of Commons Library’s website. It added that the king also receives private income from investments and inherited wealth, which is not made public, leading some critics to suggest that royal finances are “shrouded in fog.”
While there is no legal obligation for the king to pay taxes, the British monarch, previously the late Queen Elizabeth II, and their heir has voluntarily paid income tax since 1993 on income from the duchies and earnings from personal investments, the research briefing said.
Around 600,000 pounds ($775,275) from the sovereign grant for the year 2023-24 was spent on the king’s coronation and events surrounding the historic moment, according to the breakdown of finances in the report, which spans a difficult 12 months for the royal family, when both Charles and Kate, the Princess of Wales, were diagnosed with cancer. 
News of the monarchy's expected funding increase nonetheless drew backlash on social media, with Kevin Maguire, the associate editor of the left-leaning tabloid The Mirror, saying on X that there was ""no cost of living squeeze for indulged King Charles."" 
“The Monarchy is a ripoff. King Charles getting £45m richer off backs of British people in midst of foodbanks, spiraling cost of living crisis, broken NHS, deepening child poverty etc is morally bankrupt & disgusting,” author Shola Mos-Shogbamimu said in a post on X. 
For years, Britain has been plagued by a spiraling cost-of-living crisis, with real wages flatlining for a decade, leaving the U.K.'s average salary at just £29,669, or $38,000, as prices for utilities and food have soared. 
Government figure show 30% of children are growing up in poverty and Britain has the worst rate of homelessness in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
The economy and inflation were among the top issues fueling the Labour Party's landslide victory in a general election this month,  ending the Conservative government's 14-year rule.  
Graham Smith, who leads the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, in a statement drew a comparison with Ireland’s head of state, President Michael Higgins, who he said came at “a fraction of the cost for someone doing a similar job,” but was “elected and accountable to do it.” 
“We do not owe the royals a living, we do not owe them palatial homes, private helicopter travel or lives of leisure and luxury,” he said. Chantal Da Silva reports on world news for NBC News Digital and is based in London."
NBC_32,"Alabama universities shutter DEI offices, open new programs, to comply with new state law",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-universities-shutter-dei-offices-new-law-rcna163400,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The three University of Alabama System campuses on Tuesday shuttered diversity, equity and inclusion offices— and opened new offices — to comply with a new Republican-backed law attempting to ban the programs on public college campuses in the state.
The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, along with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Alabama in Huntsville, issued statements announcing the closure of diversity, equity and inclusion offices of each campus and the creation of a new university division or office. Each university said the change was made to comply with the new state law.
The Alabama law is part of a wave of proposals from Republican lawmakers across the country taking aim at diversity, equity and inclusion programs — also known as DEI — on college campuses.
The law, which takes effect Oct. 1, prohibits public universities, K-12 school systems and state agencies in Alabama from maintaining DEI offices. However, it’s unclear how much the law will impact the outreach and support functions previously performed by DEI offices.
The law defines DEI programs as classes, training, programs and events where attendance is based on a person’s race, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin or sexual orientation. Each university said the new offices will focus on student success.
“Our mission has not wavered, and we remain committed to our institutional goals to welcome all, serve all and see all thrive and succeed,” University of Alabama President Stuart R. Bell said in a statement to the campus.
The University of Alabama’s Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will close and a new Division of Opportunities, Connections and Success, has opened. The new division will be led by Christine Taylor, the university vice president and associate provost who had previously led the diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on campus.
Similar DEI offices at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Alabama in Huntsville closed. The new UAB Office of Access and Engagement will led by Vice President for Access and Engagement Paulette Dilworth, who had led diversity, equity and inclusion offices at the university.
“This is a new office with a new, exciting function, focusing on what we can do to promote success for everyone in the UAB community,” UAB President Ray L. Watts said in a statement.
Similar battles over DEI offices and diversity training programs have taken place in other GOP-dominated states. Republicans say the programs deepen divisions promote a particular political viewpoint. But opponents say it is a rollback of hard-won advances and programs that welcome underrepresented student populations.
“We are extremely disappointed to learn that the University of Alabama system is closing its diversity, equity, and inclusion offices just weeks before students are expected to return to campus,” JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, the executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, said in a statement.
The organization said University of Alabama students had been among the most vocal opponents of the legislation.
Republican Sen. Will Barfoot, the sponsor of the legislation, did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the closures.The Associated Press"

Victor Hugo Roldan, the chief of emergency services and firefighters in Jalisco state, told Reuters the blast occurred in a 500,000-litre tank at the plant, and the resulting fire was put out by company personnel.
At least two other tanks at the facility, operated by the world’s largest tequila maker Becle, also collapsed, he said.
In a statement, the company confirmed the death toll from the accident at its Rojeña plant, adding that several other workers were injured.
The explosion in one tank triggered a fire in three others, according to a statement from emergency services released later on Tuesday. The cause of the blast remains unknown.
A photo of the aftermath of the explosion released by emergency services showed a large metal tank emblazoned with the Cuervo logo collapsed on its side.
The town of Tequila, home to several distilleries of the agave spirit, is a popular tourist destination about an hour’s drive northwest of Guadalajara, Mexico’s second largest city."

But in a statement, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the carrier had largely recovered from the outsized impact it experienced from the incident.
Data from FlightAware on Wednesday morning showed 47 canceled and 242 delayed Delta flights, though it was not immediately clear how many were attributable to IT issues, as a major storm system moved through the southern United States.
Dallas-based American Airlines was seeing similar cancellation and delay numbers.
Separate data from the aviation intelligence group Anuvu showed 16% of scheduled Delta flights were canceled, with just 18% departing on time.
In his statement, Bastian said he expected cancellations Wednesday ""to be minimal.""
""While our initial efforts to stabilize the operations were difficult and frustratingly slow and complex, we have made good progress this week and the worst impacts of the CrowdStrike-caused outage are clearly behind us,"" Bastian said, noting delays and cancellations were down 50% Tuesday compared to Monday.
""Thursday is expected to be a normal day, with the airline fully recovered and operating at a traditional level of reliability.""
Delta said Tuesday that many of its worldwide operations relied on Microsoft, and that a crew scheduling system had seen an acute disruption as a result of the glitch.
That led to thousands of the carrier's flights being canceled, leaving passengers stranded at airports and prompting the Transportation Department to investigate.
In an appearance Tuesday on NBC News Now with Hallie Jackson, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he had spoken with Bastian to remind him that passengers who decline to take rebookings are entitled to cash refunds.
“This could absolutely lead to major enforcement action,” Buttigieg said, noting the record penalty his department had levied against Southwest Airlines after its 2022 winter meltdown.
""We really wanted to send a message that this is a new chapter in how we enforce passenger protections and rights ... clearly we need to continue sending that message,"" he said.Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."
NBC_35,Southwest Airlines faces FAA audit over string of near-miss incidents,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/southwest-airlines-near-miss-incidents-faa-investigation-rcna163388,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday it was placing Southwest Airlines under a heightened safety review after a string of recent near-miss safety incidents involving the low-cost carrier.
In a statement, the agency said it was increasing oversight of Southwest ""to ensure it is complying with federal safety regulations.""
“Safety will drive the timeline,” the agency said.  
The development comes amid ongoing jitters about the state of U.S. aviation first sparked in January, when a door panel on a Boeing-manufactured aircraft blew out midair. That incident prompted the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation of Boeing, and led to the ouster of its leadership. A planned rollout of Boeing's latest-generation 737 Max line was also suspended.
Since then, United Airlines announced in March an independent review of its safety measures following its own near-miss incidents. In May, the U.S. Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said it would audit the FAA's oversight of United Airlines maintenance practices — the fifth-such OIG report following ones scrutinizing the FAA's oversight of Allegiant, American, SkyWest and Southwest airlines' maintenance practices. 
Last week, a global IT outage linked to an update of Microsoft Windows by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike grounded flights worldwide, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. By Wednesday, Delta Air Lines said it was still working to recover from the issue.  
The FAA did not specify which incidents had prompted its latest audit announcement about Southwest.
But in April, a flight departing from Honolulu come within 400 feet of slamming into the ocean after what appeared to be an instance of pilot error. No one was injured and the plane eventually landed safely. 
Details of the incident were first reported in June by Bloomberg News.
In a statement following the Bloomberg report, Southwest said ""the event was addressed appropriately as we always strive for continuous improvement.”  
As news of the Hawaii incident emerged last month, new reports surfaced of a ""Dutch roll"" incident — said to mimic a famous Dutch ice skating tactic — on a flight from Phoenix to Oakland that caused a significant rocking motion midair. 
A subsequent investigation revealed damage to both a backup power unit as well as ""structural components"" in a way that appeared to be unique to Southwest.  
“Other airlines have not reported similar issues,” the FAA said at the time.
Within days of the Dutch roll incident, reports emerged of a Southwest flight that triggered a low-altitude alert over Oklahoma City.
And prior to the FAA's audit announcement this week, the agency said it had begun investigating an incident involving a Southwest flight departing from Columbus, Ohio, bound for Tampa that flew as low as 150 feet over Florida waters and resulted in an emergency landing in Fort Lauderdale.  
In a statement Tuesday, Southwest said it was working closely with the FAA as the agency undertakes its new review, and that it had formed a new team of experts to bolster its safety management system. 
""Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,"" it said. 
Appearing with NBC News anchor and senior Washington correspondent Hallie Jackson on Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg indicated there is no reason to believe it is unsafe to fly Southwest. But he said that while U.S. commercial aviation remains the safest in the world, ""we’ve got to keep it that way.""Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com."

The 42-year-old man was visiting from Belgium and was taking a short walk Saturday at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes in California when he lost his shoes, the National Park Service said in a news release.  
Although temperatures on Saturday reached around 123 degrees, according to the National Park Service, ground temperatures would have been much hotter. Officials said the man was wearing flip-flop sandals and it's not clear if they broke or were lost in the sand. 
The man's family called for help and asked other park visitors to carry him out of the dunes to the parking lot. The man suffered third-degree burns on his feet, the park service said. 
Due to the severity of his injury and the man being in pain, park rangers felt he needed to be transported to the hospital. 
Because of the blistering heat, Mercy Air’s helicopter could not safely land in the park because the extreme temperatures reduced rotor lift, the National Park Service said. The man was instead transported by ambulance to a landing zone at a higher elevation and then airlifted to a hospital in Las Vegas.
The excessive heat has led to several deaths recently in state and national parks.

At 11:12 a.m., an Oscar Mayer Weinermobile was traveling in the northbound lanes of Interstate 294 just before Roosevelt Road when the Wienermobile driver struck a Hyundai Sedan, also traveling north, Illinois State Police said.
After striking the Hyundai, the driver of the Weinermobile lost control, overcorrected and rolled onto its side, ISP said.
No injuries were reported.
Backups were initially reported, but traffic had resumed as normal in the hours following the crash.
Photos and video from the scene showed an orange and yellow Oscar Mayer Wienermobile being hauled away on the platform of a semi truck. Another angle showed the vehicle flipped over on its side, with an overturned hotdog atop the automobile.
According to the Wienermobile tracker website, the vehicle’s next stop in the Chicago area is set to come July 27, when the Wienermobile is scheduled to make an appearance at a Tony’s Fresh Market in Round Lake Beach.
The Wienermobile, which travels year-round, uses “six different hot dogs on wheels driving around the country at all times,” the tracking website said."
NBC_38,Nashville museum returns 500-year-old Mexican artifact collection back where it 'belongs',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/nashville-parthenon-museum-returns-mexican-artifacts-rcna163296,2024-07-24 21:00:19.122200,,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — This city's renowned Parthenon Museum is bidding farewell to one of its prized collections: This month over 250 Mexican artifacts — including ancient tools, instruments and clay sculptures dating back more than 500 years — are being returned to Mexico City, where they will eventually be put on display.
The prized artifacts have been at the Parthenon since the late 1960s, when an Oregon doctor donated them for tax deduction purposes. Farmers in western Mexico had sold them for cheap, thinking they were junk found on their farms.
“Mexico has had a lot of their history removed in this way,” said Bonnie Seymour, the assistant curator who led the museum’s repatriation effort.
“It’s just the responsibility of all museums to return that,"" she said at a celebration to mark the repatriation, where traditional dances and other cultural touchstones honored Mexico's history. ""We can’t fix the holes that are lost, because a lot of context is lost. But we can give it back to where it belongs.”
Seymour introduced the artifacts to visitors one last time as part of “Repatriation and its Impact,” an exhibition exploring the global debate around repatriation. The exhibit’s walls detail famous repatriation cases, including the Parthenon’s namesake in Athens, Greece, where politicians continue to call on the British Museum to return ancient sculptures stolen two centuries ago.
“Museums aren’t evil institutions trying to keep people’s things away from them,” said Seymour, adding that several museums have contacted her asking for help to return some of their collections. “We just don’t know what to do, and we’re trying to figure it out.”
The Mexican Consulate in Atlanta is collecting the artifacts. Consul General Javier Díaz de León said they’re a small part of the more than 13,000 artifacts the current Mexican administration has recovered through repatriation. Once the artifacts arrive in Mexico, staff members at the National Institute of Anthropology and History will decide on their permanent home.
“By recovering these pieces, we’re recovering a piece of a memory,” de León said. “That way, people who live in Mexico have direct contact with pieces that represent how their ancestors live, where they come from and part of our history.”
Nashville, in turn, will be able to retain the memory of what was once a staple of its collection; 3D prints of several of the artifacts are now part of the museum’s educational collection. 
Seymour said she hopes they’ll help teach visitors about the nuances of repatriation.
3D paintings featuring a giant feathered serpent, a bronzed Aztec warrior and a colorful painting of a Mexican hairless dog surround the pre-Columbian artifacts in the gallery — drawing from them for inspiration. They’re the work of Jose Vera Gonzalez, a Nashville artist who immigrated from Michoacán, Mexico. He calls Seymour his “hero.”
“My big inspiration is the Mexican story and ancestral history,” Gonzalez said. The artifacts remind him of Mexico’s long history of artists and of the respect and love he has for his country, he said.
For the Parthenon’s visitors, it’s a bittersweet goodbye to artifacts they’ve come to remember as a staple of the museum’s collection. 
“It’s nice to see the culture being shared worldwide,” said Paulina Alvarado, a Mexican student in Nashville who participated in the repatriation celebrations. “[But] having permission from that culture and from the people to be able to share that culture with others — that’s important to me.”

Harris’ allies in the tech community have launched a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to convince wealthy donors to back her campaign for president, according to people familiar with the matter.
Longtime investors Reid Hoffman and Ron Conway have been among Harris’ allies in Silicon Valley privately calling on those in their networks to support the vice president over Trump, these people explained.
The conversations have been ongoing since Sunday, when Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, according to people who described the discussions to CNBC.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a potential running mate for Harris, is now in support of a bill that's been lauded by labor unions.
A spokesperson for the Arizona senator told NBC News today that Kelly would vote for the PRO Act, a measure he has not yet co-sponsored. The bill has 49 sponsors, including independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Kelly is the rare Democrat not to sign on.
Kelly has come under criticism from some unions in recent days for declining to back the key piece of legislation, prompting some to argue it should disqualify him from being the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee.

Trump called for FBI Director Christopher Wray's resignation, pointing to Wray's testimony before Congress today in which he denied seeing Biden experiencing cognitive issues.
The former president said that Wray should resign for ""lying to Congress,"" arguing that ""anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged, and if you can’t see that, you sure as hell can’t be running the FBI.""

Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley today dodged questions about whether it's smart for the GOP to characterize Harris as a ""DEI candidate"" or a ""diversity hire.""
""I think our conversation regarding Kamala Harris needs to focus on two things. One, that she is a California liberal ... I think the other thing that we need to focus on is the fact that it is the Biden-Harris administration. It is the Biden-Harris campaign,"" Whatley said when asked directly about Republicans calling Harris a DEI candidate.
Pressed a second time on the language being used against Harris, Whatley said, ""Kamala Harris is the most radical left candidate that the Democrats have ever put on a ticket.""

The DNC Rules Committee met this afternoon to establish the framework for the presidential nomination process. Rules Committee Co-Chairs Bishop Leah Daughtry and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is reportedly a contender for Harris’ running mate, led the meeting.
The committee voted to begin the virtual roll call on Aug. 1, assuming Harris is the only candidate for the nomination. The DNC must formally nominate both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate ahead of Aug. 7. The DNC confirmed today that, if they fail to meet this deadline, their nominees may not appear on the Ohio ballot. When the convention begins on Aug. 19, it will hold a ceremonial roll call for the nominees.
Voting closed and the rules were formally adopted around 3:41 p.m. ET.

In a letter to the Trump and Harris campaigns and obtained by CNBC, Fox News president Jay Wallace and vice president for politics Jessica Loker invited Harris and Trump to debate in Pennsylvania on Sept. 17.
The letter added that the moderators would be Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier.
Biden and Trump had committed to a debate earlier in September on ABC News, but it's unclear whether an ABC News debate will still take place now that Biden has stepped aside and endorsed Harris.
The proposed Fox debate could come the day before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for his hush money conviction. The sentencing hearing had been scheduled for July 11, but the judge overseeing the trial postponed it until at least Sept. 18 after Trump's lawyers asked for more time to review the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.

Netanyahu said he wants to thank former President Trump ""for his leadership"" and his efforts to secure the Abraham Accords, the September 2020 deal to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and Israel and Bahrain. That line drew cheers from lawmakers in the chamber. 
""Like Americans, Israelis were relieved that President Trump emerged safe and sound from that dastardly attack on him,"" he said. ""There is no room for political violence in democracies.""
""I also want to thank President Trump for all the things he did for Israel — from recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights ... to recognizing Jerusalem as our capital and moving the American Embassy"" there from Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said, which drew some boos from the chamber. 
Netanyahu is expected to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday.

Netanyahu blasted the International Criminal Court in his speech and said, ""America will be next."" 
""The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully accused Israel of deliberately starving the people of Gaza. This is utter, complete nonsense. It's a complete fabrication,"" Netanyahu said. 
The ICC's chief prosecutor said in May that he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders so they can be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
The prosecutor said he was also seeking an arrest warrant for Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.

Through the several standing ovations for Netanyahu, two Democratic senators — Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Chris Murphy of Connecticut —have stayed in their seats and not clapped. When Netanyahu spoke about bringing hostages home, Murphy, Warnock, Reps. Pete Aguilar of California and Katherine Clark of Connecticut seemed to be the only Democrats who did not stand. 
Schumer smiled for the first time in his remarks when Netanyahu spoke about IDF soldiers returning to battle. 
Senate Democrats were seated in the front two rows. Besides Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia Joe Manchin (both have left the Democratic Party and become independents) all stayed seated and did not clap when Netanyahu said protestors should be ashamed of themselves.

Netanyahu thanked Biden for his efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza since Oct. 7.
""I want to thank President Biden for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families,"" Netanyahu said, and ""for his heartfelt support for Israel."" 
""After the savage attack on Oct. 7, he rightly called Hamas sheer evil,"" he said. 
Netanyahu's comments about Biden were met with resounding bipartisan applause. There has been tension between the two leaders over Netanyahu's  handling of the war in Gaza and they are expected to meet tomorrow in the White House.
Biden ""came to Israel to stand with us during our darkest hour — a visit that will never be forgotten,"" said Netanyahu. ""Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel, and for being, as he says, a proud Zionist.""

Netanyahu said on ""the morning of Oct. 7, the entire world saw Noa's look of desperation as she was violently abducted to Gaza on the back of a motorcycle.""
He referenced the operation that rescued Argamani and three other hostages who were held captive in Gaza.

About 500 protestors gathered in the street earlier this morning ahead of  Netanyahu's address to Congress.
The protesters were standing behind a large canvas banner that reads “Arrest Netanyahu for Genocide"" and planned to create a “people’s red line against genocide” and conduct a “citizen’s arrest” of Netanyahu. 
The group has provided attendees with signs on wood posts with phrases like “free all Palestinian political prisoners” and “lift the siege on Gaza now” as well as a “wanted” posted for Netanyahu.

In remarks at the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. Grand Boule in Indianapolis, Harris sought to draw a stark contrast between the policies she champions and those proposed by Trump and his conservative allies.
“As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, we must also recognize there are those who are trying to take us backward. You may have seen their agenda, part of it is called Project 2025,” she said, referring to an expansive conservative blueprint for a second Trump term proposed by the Heritage Foundation, which Trump has sought to distance himself from. 
Harris argued that Project 2025 is an effort to “return America to a dark past.”
“This represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future,” she said. “These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back.”
Harris told the gathering of one of the nation's largest historically Black sororities that Americans’ “hard won freedoms and rights,” such as voting rights and reproductive health rights, are under threat. She specifically took aim at Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, which ultimately led to the overturning in 2022 of the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.
“Well, let me tell you something: When I am president of the United States, and when Congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law,” she said.
Harris concluded that “there’s so much at stake in this moment.”
“Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve,” she said.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro dodged questions today about whether he's being vetted as a potential running mate for Harris, and told reporters when asked about calls for the Democratic National Convention to hold an open nomination vote that ""anyone could have jumped into this process.""
""It was an open process,"" Shapiro said at a press conference in New Castle, Pennsylvania. ""The vice president jumped in. I endorsed her immediately, as of course did President Biden. She has earned this nomination. She has earned the support of the needed number of delegates to make her the nominee. She has done an extraordinary job over the last, what has it been, 72-96 hours, something like that, of consolidating the party behind her.""
""For anyone calling for any open process, I will tell you we had one,"" he continued. ""And you know what? She kicked butt, and she earned the support, and she earned the nomination, and I’m proud to support her.""
Shapiro also called Harris' decision about a running mate a ""deeply personal"" one ""that she is obviously quite familiar with because she went through it with then-candidate Biden when she was selected to serve as the vice president of the United States.""
The decision should be made ""free from any political pressure,"" Shapiro added.

The father of one of the American hostages held in Gaza questioned Netanyahu's speech to Congress during an interview on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports.""
Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui Dekel-Chen has been held hostage in Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, called Netanyahu’s visit to the U.S. this week a “staged piece of political theater."" He said that “the vast majority of Israelis already understand” that Netanyahu is in “survival” mode,” and if the war in Gaza were to end, “it is doubtful” his coalition government “would survive.” 
He also criticized the meeting Netanyahu held last night with hostage families as ""neither intimate, nor just hostage families."" He said Netanyahu brought his own guests to the meeting and the ""most vocal were people not exposed to anything other than Bibi’s political line.""

Even if not directly stated, Andy Beshear knew why he was on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”: an audition. 
About halfway through an 11-minute interview Monday morning, the 48-year-old Kentucky governor, who comes from the state’s political royalty, seamlessly turned his attention to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who last week was picked as Donald Trump’s running mate. 
“I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, because let me tell you, JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said.
Beshear’s jab was no accident. 
Vance’s selection last week was viewed, in part, through the lens of geography. He is from a small, poverty-stricken town in Ohio and seen as someone who could solidify the Trump campaign in key swaths of the Midwest and Pennsylvania. 
After President Joe Biden made the historic decision to get out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s likely nominee and started the process of picking a running mate. Her shortlist includes several white governors from politically important states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and Beshear.
Unlike the others, Beshear’s red-hued state is most likely not in play in 2024. The two-term red-state governor, though, won re-election last year in a state Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2020. He also won by 22 percentage points in the eastern Kentucky county that Vance referred to in his Republican National Convention speech, a county Trump claimed by 52 points in 2020. In a region where Democrats are still fighting for votes, Beshear is seen as someone with a bipartisan reputation who can serve as a counterbalance to Vance.

The Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees will hold a joint hearing next Tuesday on the attempted assassination of Trump, Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said today on the Senate floor. 
“We have a responsibility to get to the bottom of how the Secret Service failed to protect former President Trump on July 13,"" Durbin said.
""We need to do this on a bipartisan basis,"" he continued. ""Keep politics out of it. … We need to ask probing and important questions. We need to do it in a responsible way that avoids the kind of incendiary language that has become all too common in our country.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing today that a laptop tied to Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks, showed a Google search on July 6 that asked, “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?”
The search refers to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.
Wray also said the shooter’s rifle “had a collapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.""
The hearing on FBI oversight has focused on the details surrounding the attempted assassination of Trump.

FBI Director Christopher Wray pushed back today on recent GOP slights against working women and people of color, telling a House Judiciary Committee hearing that it was an “insult” for critics to suggest they are less qualified for the job. 
“Any notion that we have lowered our standards is just not accurate,” Wray said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have come under criticism from some Republicans after the attempted assassination of Trump on July 13 and Biden's decision on Sunday to end his re-election campaign, making way for Harris as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
On Monday, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle that she was a “DEI horror story” during a hearing on the security lapses at Trump's rally. That day, Burchett also called Harris a “DEI vice president.” 
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing today, when asked to address DEI attacks, Wray said the FBI's hiring process was as “competitive and selective as ever.” 
The notion that women and people of color are “less qualified, frankly, is not at all consistent with what I’ve seen,” Wray said.
Wray is expected to continue testifying about the FBI’s investigation into the gunman’s motive and his preparations.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in remarks on the Senate floor this morning that he plans to attend Netanyahu's speech this afternoon despite his differences with the Israeli prime minister.
“Even though I disagree with many of Bibi Netanyahu policies, I will attend the speech because the United States relationship with Israel remains ironclad and transcends any prime minister or president, and we must do all we can to get our hostages home,"" said Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. ever.
In March, Schumer called for new elections in Israel to replace Netanyahu as the country's prime minister, saying that he had ""lost his way ... by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.""

When Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman of color to be president if elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did.
Trump and his allies are taking pages from the same playbook they used the last time a woman was on top of the Democratic ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father.

Several of the six American hostage families who are in Washington for the Netanyahu speech said they are upset that he is here instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. 
They are also upset that he brought Israeli families to a meeting they had with him at his hotel Monday night — conducted in Hebrew — and every time they pressed him on the hostage deal, his aides would call on one of the prime minister’s supporters to validate his insistence that he still has to go after Hamas. 
Some of the families will be watching his speech from the gallery at the invitation of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Afterward, they are supposed to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Netanyahu.  
After meeting with national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week, they say they are looking toward tomorrow’s joint meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Sullivan and the president to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles. 
Biden clearly wants to get this done on his watch. Netanyahu is under huge pressure back home from the military, the intelligence and a majority of the Israeli public to wind the war down and agree to a cease-fire. Importantly, Hezbollah has said it will observe a Gaza cease-fire — which would de-escalate the threat from the north and permit 60,000 Israelis who’ve been evacuated from their homes near the Lebanon border since Oct. 7 to return home before school is set to reopen in the fall.      
They also don’t know whether Netanyahu’s Friday meeting with Trump will help or hurt their cause: They worry Trump might encourage the Israeli leader to hold out until after the November election. They hope instead that Trump  might want to take credit for closing the deal if it’s announced next week, saying he was Netanyahu's last meeting before flying home.

Building an airplane as it takes off is no way to build an airplane. And yet, sometimes, circumstances dictate that you have no choice but to try.
Of all the potential metaphors to use and abuse in this unprecedented moment, that’s probably the best one. Building a national campaign isn’t easy. It’s also exactly what Harris and the Democrats are doing with just over 100 days until Election Day.
Harris tried it once herself and experienced some ups but a lot more downs. She’s getting a massive head start this time compared to her 2020 primary campaign, thanks to what has turned into an almost seamless handoff from President Joe Biden to the new de facto Democratic nominee.
The Democratic National Committee seems set on trying to nominate Harris and her eventual running mate in a virtual delegate roll call before the actual convention begins. While I understand some of party leaders’ technical concerns around state laws and waiting until the start of the convention to officially nominate Harris and her running mate, it seems like an unnecessary step given the circumstances. The Democrats should welcome any GOP attempts to block Harris from a state ballot, because voters wouldn’t love the look, because there’s nothing about what the Democrats are doing that’s illegal or even unprecedented.

Vote.org says that a surge in voter registrations over the past two days has set a record for the 2024 election cycle. 
A spokesperson for the platform said the website saw more than 38,500 registrations since Biden's withdrawal. That outpaced when Taylor Swift posted on Instagram last September urging people to vote, driving about 34,000 registrations in 48 hours, the spokesperson said in an email.
The spokesperson also noted that 83% of those registrations came from young voters ages 18-34.

Senior Harris campaign aides working on helping her pick a running mate are focused on choosing someone who can speak directly to older white voters and suburban women about crime, abortion and the economy and can defend Harris against voters who may be uncomfortable supporting a Black and South Asian woman, two sources familiar with the campaign’s thinking told NBC News.
The campaign’s thinking is informed by internal polling and what they see as the state of the nation and Trump’s messaging, the sources said. They view Harris’ VP search much like former President Barack Obama’s decision to tap Biden as his running mate in 2008.
A source familiar with the campaign’s thinking said Harris aides are “batting around internally” which potential running mates will “appeal in short order to that 1 or 2 percent of voters” in battleground states who will likely decide the election.
“They are feeling like you need somebody who can go in and talk to these suburban women,” the source said. “The internal polling is showing that’s who you’re targeting. You’re targeting them on reproductive rights. You’re targeting them on democracy. You’re targeting them on law and order. You’re not really trying to sell them on governing or on record or any of that, but these are sort of softer issues.”
A second source familiar with how the Harris campaign is approaching selecting her running mate said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are viewed as top contenders by many aides, though others, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are also being vetted and considered also potential good choices.
The campaign is particularly interested in someone who will appeal to demographics and the voters that Biden would have brought to the table, including older white voters and suburban women, the source said. 
Aides to Harris also would like the running mate to appeal specifically to white men who don’t like Trump but who may have doubts about voting for a Black and South Asian woman, the source said.
“Let’s just face it. There’s a lot of sexist, racist white dudes out there in America who don’t like Trump, but just need a little extra validation. And, bringing one of the people mentioned onto the ticket helps validate her among those constituents,” the source said, adding that the campaign would like the running mate to appeal both to battleground states and to be ready to fight back hard at Republican attacks.
The source noted that the campaign is “in the honeymoon stage right now” in its VP search, “but things are about to get real.” 
“She needs someone who is going to be able to defend her and stand by her in the numerous hard times that are ahead. MAGA is just going to unleash,” the source said. “These are going to be terrifyingly crazy days. She needs someone who will be able to prop her up during hard times, and someone who, when these memes take hold, when the deepfakes take hold, when all those things start happening, will be able to stand by her and validate her to a small core constituency that will ultimately decide this election.”

In Harris’ quick, if unorthodox, rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, elected officials, activists and operatives see in her a new chance to beat Trump and make history in one swoop.
Eight years after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Harris could be the first female president and the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold the nation’s top job, as well.
Democrats are somewhat optimistic, now armed with weapons they didn’t have in 2016: a messenger in Harris who is uniquely positioned to energize voters following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn national abortion rights, more proof from the ballot box that women can win in battleground areas and the knowledge that Trump himself is beatable — if still politically dangerous.
“The lessons that still apply [from 2016] are that people need to take Trump and his supporters seriously,” Shaunna Thomas, who co-founded and runs the pro-women group Ultraviolet, told NBC News. “That’s even more of a top-line message than whether or not a woman can win the presidency.”

Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.
The sources said current plans are to hold indoor rallies, but they also said it’s possible Trump will participate in smaller outdoor events or larger rallies in facilities where entrances are more fully controlled and there are not issues with high ground nearby, like stadiums.
Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment last night.
News of the shift in venues comes the day the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, announced her resignation. In her resignation letter, Cheatle said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” in Pennsylvania.

In a new memo, the Harris campaign outlined what it views as the vice president’s pathway to victory and contextualized its belief that she is in a “position of strength” heading into the November election.
Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon cited Harris’ advantages with Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, female and young voters. Dillon also pointed to the support Harris has gained through grassroots fundraising and her ability to communicate effectively on the issue of abortion rights.
“With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,” Dillon wrote.
Dillon argued that Harris is “well positioned” to expand support from the 2020 election, citing voters who didn’t support for the Biden-Harris ticket that year but came out to vote for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections as “Donald Trump’s Republican Party grew more and more extreme.”
Dillon, however, noted that the campaign must bring more awareness to Harris and her policies in order to win voters who aren't familiar with her.
“In a highly polarized electoral environment, this shift in the race opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,” Dillon wrote. “This race is more fluid now — the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies.”
“This expanded universe of winnable voters is highly accessible to Vice President Harris: We have a clear advantage on issues, they have been supportive of Democrats in the past, and many are supportive of Democrats down-ballot,” she added. “It is the job of the Harris campaign to win these voters, but the pathway to do so is clear.”
Dillon concluded that the campaign will be “close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon, his first since Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of hostages to Gaza, where about 100 are still believed to be held captive.
Netanyahu’s speech at 2 p.m. ET comes at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed an estimated 30,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
“In my speech, I will emphasize the importance of bipartisan support for Israel, I will address our friends on both sides of the map and tell them that regardless of who will be chosen to lead the American people after the presidential elections, Israel is the most important ally of the United States in the Middle East, an irreplaceable ally,” Netanyahu said before he left for the U.S., according to his office.
He added, “I think that in this time of war and uncertainty, it is of utmost importance that our enemies know that the U.S. and Israel stand together — today, tomorrow and forever.”

For more than three at-times excruciating weeks, Biden and his team were locked in a campaign to save his candidacy. With his prime-time address to the nation tonight, a new effort is underway: to shape his legacy.
A team of Biden’s closest advisers is already at work to plot out what that will look like. The discussion includes domestic priorities he could advance in coming budget negotiations with Congress or through executive action, diplomatic initiatives he could see through with a freer hand and accomplishing what he has described as the most elusive of the three goals he outlined in his 2020 campaign — unifying the country.
NBC News spoke to a half-dozen White House and campaign officials about what Biden is planning, and advisers said they recognize that the biggest factor shaping how he is viewed in history will be whether Vice President Kamala Harris is successful in her bid to succeed him.
“Everything is being viewed through that lens,” a White House official said.

The committee voted to begin the virtual roll call on Aug. 1, assuming Harris is the only candidate for the nomination. The DNC must formally nominate both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate ahead of Aug. 7. The DNC confirmed today that, if they fail to meet this deadline, their nominees may not appear on the Ohio ballot.

In a letter to the Trump and Harris campaigns and obtained by CNBC, Fox News president Jay Wallace and vice president for politics Jessica Loker invited Harris and Trump to debate in Pennsylvania on Sept. 17.
The letter added that the moderators would be Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier.
Biden and Trump had committed to a debate earlier in September on ABC News, but it's unclear whether an ABC News debate will still take place now that Biden has stepped aside and endorsed Harris.
The proposed Fox debate could come the day before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced for his hush money conviction. The sentencing hearing had been scheduled for July 11, but the judge overseeing the trial postponed it until at least Sept. 18 after Trump's lawyers asked for more time to review the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.Rebecca Shabad

In remarks at the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. Grand Boule in Indianapolis, Harris sought to draw a stark contrast between the policies she champions and those proposed by Trump and his conservative allies.
“As we work to build a brighter future and to move our nation forward, we must also recognize there are those who are trying to take us backward. You may have seen their agenda, part of it is called Project 2025,” she said, referring to an expansive conservative blueprint for a second Trump term proposed by the Heritage Foundation, which Trump has sought to distance himself from. 
Harris argued that Project 2025 is an effort to “return America to a dark past.”
“This represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future,” she said. “These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back.”
Harris told the gathering of one of the nation's largest historically Black sororities that Americans’ “hard won freedoms and rights,” such as voting rights and reproductive health rights, are under threat. She specifically took aim at Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, which ultimately led to the overturning in 2022 of the landmark ruling Roe v. Wade that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.
“Well, let me tell you something: When I am president of the United States, and when Congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law,” she said.
Harris concluded that “there’s so much at stake in this moment.”
“Our nation, as it always has, is counting on you to energize, to organize and to mobilize, to register folks to vote, to get them to the polls and to continue to fight for the future our nation and her people deserve,” she said.Emma Barnett

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro dodged questions today about whether he's being vetted as a potential running mate for Harris, and told reporters when asked about calls for the Democratic National Convention to hold an open nomination vote that ""anyone could have jumped into this process.""
""It was an open process,"" Shapiro said at a press conference in New Castle, Pennsylvania. ""The vice president jumped in. I endorsed her immediately, as of course did President Biden. She has earned this nomination. She has earned the support of the needed number of delegates to make her the nominee. She has done an extraordinary job over the last, what has it been, 72-96 hours, something like that, of consolidating the party behind her.""
""For anyone calling for any open process, I will tell you we had one,"" he continued. ""And you know what? She kicked butt, and she earned the support, and she earned the nomination, and I’m proud to support her.""
Shapiro also called Harris' decision about a running mate a ""deeply personal"" one ""that she is obviously quite familiar with because she went through it with then-candidate Biden when she was selected to serve as the vice president of the United States.""
The decision should be made ""free from any political pressure,"" Shapiro added.Nicole Moeder

He also criticized the meeting Netanyahu held last night with hostage families as ""neither intimate, nor just hostage families."" He said Netanyahu brought his own guests to the meeting and the ""most vocal were people not exposed to anything other than Bibi’s political line.""Matt Dixon

Even if not directly stated, Andy Beshear knew why he was on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe”: an audition. 
About halfway through an 11-minute interview Monday morning, the 48-year-old Kentucky governor, who comes from the state’s political royalty, seamlessly turned his attention to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who last week was picked as Donald Trump’s running mate. 
“I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, because let me tell you, JD Vance ain’t from here,” Beshear said.
Beshear’s jab was no accident. 
Vance’s selection last week was viewed, in part, through the lens of geography. He is from a small, poverty-stricken town in Ohio and seen as someone who could solidify the Trump campaign in key swaths of the Midwest and Pennsylvania. 
After President Joe Biden made the historic decision to get out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris became the party’s likely nominee and started the process of picking a running mate. Her shortlist includes several white governors from politically important states, including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and Beshear.
Unlike the others, Beshear’s red-hued state is most likely not in play in 2024. The two-term red-state governor, though, won re-election last year in a state Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2020. He also won by 22 percentage points in the eastern Kentucky county that Vance referred to in his Republican National Convention speech, a county Trump claimed by 52 points in 2020. In a region where Democrats are still fighting for votes, Beshear is seen as someone with a bipartisan reputation who can serve as a counterbalance to Vance.

The Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees will hold a joint hearing next Tuesday on the attempted assassination of Trump, Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said today on the Senate floor. 
“We have a responsibility to get to the bottom of how the Secret Service failed to protect former President Trump on July 13,"" Durbin said.
""We need to do this on a bipartisan basis,"" he continued. ""Keep politics out of it. … We need to ask probing and important questions. We need to do it in a responsible way that avoids the kind of incendiary language that has become all too common in our country.”Matthew Nighswander

FBI Director Christopher Wray testified at a House Judiciary Committee hearing today that a laptop tied to Trump's would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks, showed a Google search on July 6 that asked, “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?”
The search refers to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963.
Wray also said the shooter’s rifle “had a collapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.""
The hearing on FBI oversight has focused on the details surrounding the attempted assassination of Trump.

FBI Director Christopher Wray pushed back today on recent GOP slights against working women and people of color, telling a House Judiciary Committee hearing that it was an “insult” for critics to suggest they are less qualified for the job. 
“Any notion that we have lowered our standards is just not accurate,” Wray said.
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have come under criticism from some Republicans after the attempted assassination of Trump on July 13 and Biden's decision on Sunday to end his re-election campaign, making way for Harris as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
On Monday, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle that she was a “DEI horror story” during a hearing on the security lapses at Trump's rally. That day, Burchett also called Harris a “DEI vice president.” 
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing today, when asked to address DEI attacks, Wray said the FBI's hiring process was as “competitive and selective as ever.” 
The notion that women and people of color are “less qualified, frankly, is not at all consistent with what I’ve seen,” Wray said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in remarks on the Senate floor this morning that he plans to attend Netanyahu's speech this afternoon despite his differences with the Israeli prime minister.
“Even though I disagree with many of Bibi Netanyahu policies, I will attend the speech because the United States relationship with Israel remains ironclad and transcends any prime minister or president, and we must do all we can to get our hostages home,"" said Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. ever.
In March, Schumer called for new elections in Israel to replace Netanyahu as the country's prime minister, saying that he had ""lost his way ... by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.""Amanda TerkelPolitics Managing Editor
When Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman of color to be president if elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did.
Trump and his allies are taking pages from the same playbook they used the last time a woman was on top of the Democratic ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father.

Several of the six American hostage families who are in Washington for the Netanyahu speech said they are upset that he is here instead of in Israel trying to get their loved ones home. 
They are also upset that he brought Israeli families to a meeting they had with him at his hotel Monday night — conducted in Hebrew — and every time they pressed him on the hostage deal, his aides would call on one of the prime minister’s supporters to validate his insistence that he still has to go after Hamas. 
Some of the families will be watching his speech from the gallery at the invitation of Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Afterward, they are supposed to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Netanyahu.  
After meeting with national security adviser Jake Sullivan this week, they say they are looking toward tomorrow’s joint meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for Sullivan and the president to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal as soon as next week with no new obstacles. 
Biden clearly wants to get this done on his watch. Netanyahu is under huge pressure back home from the military, the intelligence and a majority of the Israeli public to wind the war down and agree to a cease-fire. Importantly, Hezbollah has said it will observe a Gaza cease-fire — which would de-escalate the threat from the north and permit 60,000 Israelis who’ve been evacuated from their homes near the Lebanon border since Oct. 7 to return home before school is set to reopen in the fall.      
They also don’t know whether Netanyahu’s Friday meeting with Trump will help or hurt their cause: They worry Trump might encourage the Israeli leader to hold out until after the November election. They hope instead that Trump  might want to take credit for closing the deal if it’s announced next week, saying he was Netanyahu's last meeting before flying home. Chuck Todd
Building an airplane as it takes off is no way to build an airplane. And yet, sometimes, circumstances dictate that you have no choice but to try.
Of all the potential metaphors to use and abuse in this unprecedented moment, that’s probably the best one. Building a national campaign isn’t easy. It’s also exactly what Harris and the Democrats are doing with just over 100 days until Election Day.
Harris tried it once herself and experienced some ups but a lot more downs. She’s getting a massive head start this time compared to her 2020 primary campaign, thanks to what has turned into an almost seamless handoff from President Joe Biden to the new de facto Democratic nominee.
The Democratic National Committee seems set on trying to nominate Harris and her eventual running mate in a virtual delegate roll call before the actual convention begins. While I understand some of party leaders’ technical concerns around state laws and waiting until the start of the convention to officially nominate Harris and her running mate, it seems like an unnecessary step given the circumstances. The Democrats should welcome any GOP attempts to block Harris from a state ballot, because voters wouldn’t love the look, because there’s nothing about what the Democrats are doing that’s illegal or even unprecedented.

Vote.org says that a surge in voter registrations over the past two days has set a record for the 2024 election cycle. 
A spokesperson for the platform said the website saw more than 38,500 registrations since Biden's withdrawal. That outpaced when Taylor Swift posted on Instagram last September urging people to vote, driving about 34,000 registrations in 48 hours, the spokesperson said in an email.
The spokesperson also noted that 83% of those registrations came from young voters ages 18-34.Yamiche Alcindor

Senior Harris campaign aides working on helping her pick a running mate are focused on choosing someone who can speak directly to older white voters and suburban women about crime, abortion and the economy and can defend Harris against voters who may be uncomfortable supporting a Black and South Asian woman, two sources familiar with the campaign’s thinking told NBC News.
The campaign’s thinking is informed by internal polling and what they see as the state of the nation and Trump’s messaging, the sources said. They view Harris’ VP search much like former President Barack Obama’s decision to tap Biden as his running mate in 2008.
A source familiar with the campaign’s thinking said Harris aides are “batting around internally” which potential running mates will “appeal in short order to that 1 or 2 percent of voters” in battleground states who will likely decide the election.
“They are feeling like you need somebody who can go in and talk to these suburban women,” the source said. “The internal polling is showing that’s who you’re targeting. You’re targeting them on reproductive rights. You’re targeting them on democracy. You’re targeting them on law and order. You’re not really trying to sell them on governing or on record or any of that, but these are sort of softer issues.”
A second source familiar with how the Harris campaign is approaching selecting her running mate said Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are viewed as top contenders by many aides, though others, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are also being vetted and considered also potential good choices.
The campaign is particularly interested in someone who will appeal to demographics and the voters that Biden would have brought to the table, including older white voters and suburban women, the source said. 
Aides to Harris also would like the running mate to appeal specifically to white men who don’t like Trump but who may have doubts about voting for a Black and South Asian woman, the source said.
“Let’s just face it. There’s a lot of sexist, racist white dudes out there in America who don’t like Trump, but just need a little extra validation. And, bringing one of the people mentioned onto the ticket helps validate her among those constituents,” the source said, adding that the campaign would like the running mate to appeal both to battleground states and to be ready to fight back hard at Republican attacks.
The source noted that the campaign is “in the honeymoon stage right now” in its VP search, “but things are about to get real.” 
“She needs someone who is going to be able to defend her and stand by her in the numerous hard times that are ahead. MAGA is just going to unleash,” the source said. “These are going to be terrifyingly crazy days. She needs someone who will be able to prop her up during hard times, and someone who, when these memes take hold, when the deepfakes take hold, when all those things start happening, will be able to stand by her and validate her to a small core constituency that will ultimately decide this election.”Ali Vitali
In Harris’ quick, if unorthodox, rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, elected officials, activists and operatives see in her a new chance to beat Trump and make history in one swoop.
Eight years after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Harris could be the first female president and the first Black woman and the first South Asian American to hold the nation’s top job, as well.
Democrats are somewhat optimistic, now armed with weapons they didn’t have in 2016: a messenger in Harris who is uniquely positioned to energize voters following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn national abortion rights, more proof from the ballot box that women can win in battleground areas and the knowledge that Trump himself is beatable — if still politically dangerous.
“The lessons that still apply [from 2016] are that people need to take Trump and his supporters seriously,” Shaunna Thomas, who co-founded and runs the pro-women group Ultraviolet, told NBC News. “That’s even more of a top-line message than whether or not a woman can win the presidency.”

Trump plans to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one where he was shot during an assassination attempt this month in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to two sources familiar with his campaign’s operations.
The sources said current plans are to hold indoor rallies, but they also said it’s possible Trump will participate in smaller outdoor events or larger rallies in facilities where entrances are more fully controlled and there are not issues with high ground nearby, like stadiums.
Spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment last night.
News of the shift in venues comes the day the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, announced her resignation. In her resignation letter, Cheatle said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” in Pennsylvania.

In a new memo, the Harris campaign outlined what it views as the vice president’s pathway to victory and contextualized its belief that she is in a “position of strength” heading into the November election.
Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon cited Harris’ advantages with Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, female and young voters. Dillon also pointed to the support Harris has gained through grassroots fundraising and her ability to communicate effectively on the issue of abortion rights.
“With a popular message, a strong record on the issues that matter most to swing voters, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 104 days,” Dillon wrote.
Dillon argued that Harris is “well positioned” to expand support from the 2020 election, citing voters who didn’t support for the Biden-Harris ticket that year but came out to vote for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections as “Donald Trump’s Republican Party grew more and more extreme.”
Dillon, however, noted that the campaign must bring more awareness to Harris and her policies in order to win voters who aren't familiar with her.
“In a highly polarized electoral environment, this shift in the race opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,” Dillon wrote. “This race is more fluid now — the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies.”
“This expanded universe of winnable voters is highly accessible to Vice President Harris: We have a clear advantage on issues, they have been supportive of Democrats in the past, and many are supportive of Democrats down-ballot,” she added. “It is the job of the Harris campaign to win these voters, but the pathway to do so is clear.”
Dillon concluded that the campaign will be “close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win.”Rebecca Kaplan

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to address a joint meeting of Congress this afternoon, his first since Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of hostages to Gaza, where about 100 are still believed to be held captive.
Netanyahu’s speech at 2 p.m. ET comes at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed an estimated 30,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.
“In my speech, I will emphasize the importance of bipartisan support for Israel, I will address our friends on both sides of the map and tell them that regardless of who will be chosen to lead the American people after the presidential elections, Israel is the most important ally of the United States in the Middle East, an irreplaceable ally,” Netanyahu said before he left for the U.S., according to his office.
He added, “I think that in this time of war and uncertainty, it is of utmost importance that our enemies know that the U.S. and Israel stand together — today, tomorrow and forever.”

For more than three at-times excruciating weeks, Biden and his team were locked in a campaign to save his candidacy. With his prime-time address to the nation tonight, a new effort is underway: to shape his legacy.
A team of Biden’s closest advisers is already at work to plot out what that will look like. The discussion includes domestic priorities he could advance in coming budget negotiations with Congress or through executive action, diplomatic initiatives he could see through with a freer hand and accomplishing what he has described as the most elusive of the three goals he outlined in his 2020 campaign — unifying the country.
NBC News spoke to a half-dozen White House and campaign officials about what Biden is planning, and advisers said they recognize that the biggest factor shaping how he is viewed in history will be whether Vice President Kamala Harris is successful in her bid to succeed him.

NBC_40,An Alaska veteran is finally getting his benefits — 78 years after the 103-year-old was discharged,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alaska-veteran-finally-gets-benefits-78-years-was-discharged-rcna163386,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A 103-year-old World War II veteran who’s been paying his medical bills out-of-pocket is finally getting his veterans benefits from the U.S. government after 78 years.
Louis Gigliotti’s caretaker says the former U.S. Army medical technician has a card from Veterans Affairs but he never realized he could use his status to access “free perks” such as health care.
Gigliotti, who goes by the nickname Jiggs, could use the help to pay for dental, hearing and vision problems as he embarks on his second century. He was honored last week by family, friends and patrons at the Alaska Veterans Museum in Anchorage, where he lives with his nephew’s family.
Melanie Carey, his nephew’s wife, has been Gigliotti’s caretaker for about a decade but only recently started helping him pay his medical bills. That’s when she realized he was paying out of his own pocket instead of going to the VA for care. She investigated with the local facility, where staff told her he’d never been there.
“OK, well, let’s fix that,” she recalls telling them.
“I don’t think he realized that when you’re a veteran, that there’s benefits to that,” Carey said. “I’m trying to catch him up with anything that you need to get fixed.”
Gigliotti was raised in an orphanage and worked on a farm in Norwalk, Connecticut. He tried to join the military with two friends at the outset of World War II, but he wasn’t medically eligible because of his vision. His friends were both killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Alaska National Guard said.
His second attempt to join the military was approved after the attack on the Hawaii naval base, and he served as a surgical technician during the war without going to the combat zone.
After the war, he moved to Alaska in 1955. He owned two bars in Fairbanks before relocating to Anchorage 10 years later. There, he worked for two decades as a bartender at Club Paris, Anchorage’s oldest steakhouse.
His retirement passions were caring for Millie, his wife of 38 years who died of cancer in 2003, and training boxers for free in a makeshift ring in his garage.
The state Office of Veterans Affairs awarded Gigliotti the Alaska Veterans Honor Medal for securing his benefits. The medal is awarded to Alaska veterans who served honorably in the U.S. armed forces, during times of peace or war.“This event is a reminder that regardless of how much time has passed since their service, it is never too late for veterans to apply for their benefits,” said Verdie Bowen, the agency’s director.
Carey said Gigliotti is a humble man and had to be coaxed to attend the ceremony.
“I’m like, ‘Geez, it’s really important that you get this done because there’s not a lot of 103-year-old veterans just hanging out,’” she said.
And the reason for his longevity depends on which day you ask him, Carey said.
For the longest time, he’s always said he just never feels like he’s getting old. “I just want to go more,” he said Tuesday.
On other days, the retired bartender quips the secret is “you got to have a drink a day.”The Associated Press"

A U.S. military investigation finds failures leading up to a mass shooting by an Army reservist. And Israel’s prime minister will try to shore up U.S. support in his address to Congress. 
Here’s what to know today.
As leading Democrats mobilize support for Kamala Harris in the wake of President Joe Biden dropping his re-election bid, conservative attacks on Harris’ gender and race have illuminated the drastic difference in this campaign. She would make history as the first woman of color to be president if she is elected. But criticisms about her as a “DEI” candidate, referencing work policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, are already talking points for some on the right.
“Her skin color is the correct DEI color,” said Sebastian Gorka, a host of the conservative network Newsmax and former member of the Trump administration.
Though battles over DEI have been elevated to political debate in recent years, the criticisms echo 2016 attacks on Hilary Clinton. Former President Donald Trump often centered his retorts on Clinton’s strength, appearance and questioned her qualifications. Harris has faced similar comments from Trump in 2020, namely his promotion of the baseless “birther” conspiracy — which he also pushed against former President Barack Obama and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.

In his first speech to Congress since the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to emphasize bipartisan support for Israel. While he is expected receive a warm welcome from Republicans, more than 20 House and Senate Democrats have said they plan to boycott the speech over his handling of the war in Gaza. Protests are also expected on Capitol Hill, with about 200 people arrested last night during a demonstration against the war. 
Several former senior officials from Israel’s security establishment have also expressed opposition to Netanyahu speaking in front of Congress, saying they have “grave concerns” about the “damage” his visit will do to joint U.S. and Israeli objectives. Harris is expected to skip the speech as she continues her fledgling presidential campaign, but will meet with Netanyahu privately. Biden and Netanyahu are also expected to meet at the White House tomorrow with relatives of the American hostages still held in Gaza, a source familiar with the matter said. On Friday morning, Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Palm Beach, Florida.
The Biden administration has continued working behind the scenes to try to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to express some optimism late last week when he said the negotiators were “driving toward the goal line.”

More on the Israel-Hamas war: 
A U.S. military report found “multiple errors” following an investigation into Army reservist Robert Card and his unit’s response to incidents surrounding his mental state. Card was found dead by suicide after killing 18 people at a bowling alley and bar in October. After a shoving incident with a fellow soldier, Card was hospitalized in a psychiatric unit for two weeks when his reported symptoms included psychosis, homicidal ideation and a “hit list,” according to the report. After his release, a follow-up investigation was never conducted and he was allowed to still privately own firearms.
The investigation found three officers in his unit “derelict in their duties” and acknowledged several communication missteps between medical agencies, local law enforcement and a soldier’s chain of command. “If Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) had fully executed their health and welfare check on SFC Card in September 2023, then the mass shooting and suicide may have been avoided,” one Army investigator wrote. 
Card’s family says his mental struggles were strained by service-related blast injuries and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is now aiding in research on the motivation behind the mass shooting.
A hydrothermal explosion sent rock and steam flying into the air north of the Old Faithful geyser at Yellowstone National Park yesterday morning. Video shows a towering, gray, column erupting from the ground as visitors ran for cover. 
The type of explosion that rocked Yellowstone happens when boiling water beneath the ground rapidly turns into steam because of a drop in pressure, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In Yellowstone, which is famed for its thermal features and hot pools, these explosions are “relatively common,” the USGS said.
Photos posted on social media show the boardwalk covered in dirt and rocks after the explosion. No injuries were reported, but affected areas were closed due to safety concerns.
Movie theaters in “Tornado Alley” have been packed for the release of ‘Twisters.’ A standalone sequel to the 1996 film, it follows storm chasers as they are tasked with taming a catastrophic outbreak of tornadoes across Oklahoma.

The film, which already collected a massive $80.5 million in its opening weekend, “was big everywhere, but specifically in Oklahoma,” said Jim Orr, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, which released the film.

As reporters, we’ve seen lots of police body camera footage over the years — but never any quite like this. For our story about a Texas lawman’s two-year quest to criminally charge school librarians over the books on their shelves, Tyler Kingkade and I obtained the officer’s 821-page investigative file and videos of his attempts to question librarians.
The footage of an officer searching school libraries in search of evidence of crime shocked free-speech advocates and offers a visceral image of how far some authorities are willing to go to punish educators for allowing children to access books dealing with sex, sexuality and gender.

NBC_43,North Korean trash balloon lands on South Korea's presidential compound,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-trash-balloon-lands-south-korea-president-compound-rcna163380,2024-07-24 19:00:19.122200,,"SEOUL, South Korea — It’s not the cross-border barrage South Koreans have been fearing, but a balloon carrying a bag of trash floated over from North Korea and hit the presidential compound, security officials said Wednesday.  
Seoul’s Presidential Security Service told NBC News in a telephone call that it had tracked the balloon in real-time as it was carried by the winds across its nuclear-armed neighbor's border, until it eventually landed in the the presidential compound in the South Korean capital. 
It posed no danger, the agency added.
Balloons emerged as a new and messy weapon of war earlier this year. Since May, North Korea has been floating thousands of balloons with bags of trash attached to them, which have become a new source of tension between the two Koreas. Some have been filled with bottles, old batteries and even manure, but more recently they have just been carrying waste paper. 
Pyongyang has said the launches are a tit-for-tat response to activists and defectors who have for years sent propaganda leaflets via balloons. Others have contained dollar drugs and painkillers like Paracetamol. 
South Korea’s military is “closely monitoring North Korean movements,” the country’s Defense Minister Shin Won-sik told the Japanese newspaper Yomiuiri in an interview published Wednesday. 
He added that it was possible that North Korea’s ""military could fire at the balloons being sent by South Korean activists or the source where the balloons are launched.""
However, the likelihood of Pyongyang's military detecting the exact time and location of the South Korean balloons was low, the defense ministry told NBC News.
North Korea floated another round of balloons on Sunday, which South Korea called vulgar and shameful. It responded by blaring K-Pop through loudspeakers across the border. 
“We are broadcasting K-Pop, happy lifestyle [in South Korea], the development of South Korea and so on through the loudspeaker to North Korea,” Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a briefing Tuesday. Separately, their spokesperson Lee Sung-Joon, said they expected these broadcasts to stir up domestic agitation and encourage more defections from North Korea.  
The broadcasts were the first of its kind in more than a month and previously have included K-pop songs, weather forecasts, news on Samsung, the biggest South Korean company, as well criticism of  the North Korean missile program.
Although the balloon landed away from the main presidential office, it was the first one to have landed in the presidential compound, raising security concerns about key buildings. Officials did not say whether the balloon was manually guided, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was carried by westerly winds.
South Korea has warned people to refrain from touching the objects contained in the trash bags.
Shin, South Korea’s defense minister, said Pyongyang ""may also respond by burying land mines, dissemination of propaganda leaflets using drones, disruption of the GPS, cyber-attack and so on.""
His comments came as Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov arrived in the North Korean capital on Tuesday. 
Both countries are allies of Russia, which has become more diplomatically isolated since launching an invasion on Ukraine two years ago.
North Korea is keen to boost ties with Belarus to ""open a new era,"" state media KCNA quoted Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui as saying Wednesday a day after their meeting.
His visit comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare state visit to Kim last month, where the two signed a mutual defense treaty.
Tensions between the Koreas have been escalating for months, with Kim accelerating weapons testing and North Korean soldiers repeatedly crossing the border briefly that have prompted warning shots. 
Earlier this month, North Korean President Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jang blasted South Korea for ""dirty leaflets"" that were found in the border and other areas of North Korea, hinting on the eventual resumption of balloon launches.
Satellite imagery has also shown North Korea building a wall-like structure along portions of the North Korean side of the demarcation zone (DMZ), which is a 2.5 miles thick buffer zone, half on each side of the border line.
Earlier this year, Kim completely suspended military accords agreed between the two nations in 2018. As well as sending the balloons he also restored border posts. 
South Korea resumed aerial surveillance near the border which it said was in retaliation for North Korea’s satellite launch in November.

NBC_44,"Labor practices at private-equity-owned firms may endanger teachers' pensions, says report",https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/labor-practices-private-equity-owned-firms-endanger-retirement-income-rcna163278,2024-07-24 19:00:19.122200,,"Trustees at U.S. public pension funds with over $3 trillion under management are ramping up their oversight of labor practices at companies owned by private-equity firms after a report from the country’s second-largest teachers’ union detailed recent lapses at 10 of the largest firms’ acquired entities.
The report, published Tuesday by the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million educators, health care workers and government employees, focuses on troubling labor practices at companies owned by some of the country’s largest private-equity firms. The report cites mass layoffs, forced labor, child labor and anti-union activities, and it says such practices pose a financial risk for pensioners whose retirement savings fuel private-equity operations.
“The AFT fights every day to uphold workers’ retirement security,” Randi Weingarten, the union’s president, said in a statement. “But that future and our investments cannot be dependent upon practices that harm fellow workers in the name of profit.”
More than 50 AFT members sit on 27 public pension fund boards that oversee trillions of dollars in investments. Known as the AFT Trustee Council, they reviewed the report’s findings at the union’s annual convention this week in Houston. A key takeaway in the report: Pension fund trustees must press private-equity firms to do better for the employees of the companies they own. Doing better by employees translates to better investment returns, the report contends. 
Private-equity firms use borrowed money to buy companies that they hope to sell in a few years at a profit. Independent academic research shows that such leveraged buyouts result in far more bankruptcies than acquisitions that use less debt, and the deals can result in significant job losses for rank-and-file workers. Roughly 12 million people are employed by private-equity-backed companies, according to the American Investment Council, the industry lobbying group.
Among them are workers at Packers Sanitation Services Inc., a company that cleans slaughterhouses and is owned by the Blackstone Group, a New York-based private-equity giant. Last year, the Labor Department alleged PSSI had hired over 100 children to clean its facilities across the Midwest, some as young as 13 years old, NBC News reported. Blackstone, who installed executives on the PSSI board after it bought the company, said the firm did not know children had been hired to clean the slaughterhouses. PSSI also said that it did not know the workers were children and that it had “a zero-tolerance policy against employing anyone under the age of 18.” It paid a $1.5 million fine. 
For decades, public pension funds like the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the New York State Common Retirement Fund poured billions into private equity to generate investment gains for retirees. But recently, private equity’s outsize returns have diminished, and higher interest rates have created problems for the firms’ heavily indebted companies. In addition, private-equity firms are having trouble selling the companies they own, because the market for initial public offerings has not been accommodating and interest rates have hurt the companies’ operations. That has prevented investors from cashing out their stakes and raises questions about the industry’s business model.
Last week, the $200 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas announced it would begin reducing its investments in private equity by $10 billion this fall. Other pensions have increased their allocations.
The AFT report, titled “Managing Labor Risks in Private Equity,” details the recent bankruptcy of Steward Health Care, a 31-hospital system that had been owned by private equity. The 10 private-equity firms cited in the report include the country’s largest and most prestigious — Apollo Global Management, Blackstone, Carlyle Group and KKR.
Apollo, Carlyle and KKR did not respond to emails seeking comment.
A spokesman for Blackstone said in an email: “As the report notes, we believe that being attentive to the wellbeing of our portfolio companies’ employees is foundational to building successful businesses — and is aligned with our duty as fiduciaries.” He added that Blackstone “stands unequivocally against child labor violations.”
The report highlighted the PSSI matter as an example of positive outcomes that can result amid scrutiny of private-equity-backed firms. After the Labor Department’s action and media coverage, Blackstone reached an agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers union to offer union representation at the PSSI locations. Under the agreement, the AFT report noted, about 1,200 workers — more than half of them slaughterhouse cleaners — have become union members with increased wages, better benefits and health and safety provisions.
AFT said it compiled the report at the request of its members who are trustees of public pensions but who say they often have insufficient information about their pensions’ investments to understand their risks and fulfill their fiduciary duties. That is especially common with opaque private-equity investments.
“We need more transparency — we can’t make a really good fiduciary decision unless we know who they are,” said Jacquelyn Price Ward, vice president and investment chair of the $12.6 billion Chicago Teachers’ Pension Fund. Speaking for herself, not the overall board, she added: “They don’t want us to know, but we have to figure out a way to know. I want to see the underbelly of the snake in all areas.”
The Chicago pension fund has provided benefits for public school teachers in the city since 1895. Ward said it has an 8% allocation to private equity and is dropping that back to 5%.
“Will we be successful?” asked Paula S. Barajas, a trustee of the Chicago pension, also speaking for herself, not the board. “That depends on individual trustees across the nation. Success depends on how far trustees are willing to push and draw a line in the sand.”Gretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit. A former stockbroker, she won the Pulitzer Prize in 2002 for her ""trenchant and incisive"" reporting on Wall Street."
NBC_45,Salt Lake City to host 2034 Winter Games while French Alps get tentative 2030 nod,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/salt-lake-city-host-2034-winter-games-rcna161632,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"PARIS  — The Winter Games will make a return visit to Salt Lake City in 2034 while the 2030 Olympics were tentatively set for the French Alps, officials said Wednesday.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and other organizing officials were in Paris this week, meeting with International Olympic Committee members and shoring up support for their bid to bring the Winter Games back to its 2002 site.
Salt Lake City had appeared to be a 2034 shoo-in for weeks, but late concerns came from the IOC, about U.S. authorities possibly not supporting the embattled World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  
U.S. lawmakers had launched an investigation into alleged doping by Chinese swimmers ahead of the Tokyo games, perhaps undermining WADA's authority.
Stream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock, starting with the Opening Ceremony July 26 at 12 p.m. ET.
""The last 10 days of my life were totally unexpected,"" Fraser Bullock, head of the Salt Lake City bid, told NBC affiliate KSL minutes after the vote for Salt Lake City. ""We were just cruising towards the final award and then this came up and we had to address it."" 
But with an 83-6 vote for Salt Lake City to host, Bullock said he believes the IOC has total confidence in 2034 organizers.
""We believe that we can make a few adjustments that will help  the U.S. and world anti-doping community come together and not have disagreements,"" Bullock said. ""We actually believe this will be constructive."" 
U.S. gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn said she hopes a little boy or girl heard Wednesday's news and aims to reach Salt Lake City just like she did in 2002, the first of four Olympic appearances.
“I remember this exact moment when Salt Lake City got the Olympics in 2002, and that’s what I dreamed of,” Vonn, in charge of athlete experience for the Salt Lake City bid, told NBC's the ""TODAY"" show.  
“I dreamed of being in Salt Lake, and I achieved that dream. I know today there are so many children and kids watching TV right now, getting excited and dreaming of racing in 2034.”
Each venue for 2034 already exists or will be built for temporary use, thus not saddling local taxpayers with ongoing costs or an underutilized facility, according to Bullock.""These venues carry on the prolific 2002 legacy that continues to benefit the state of Utah and its people today,"" Bullock said.
Hundreds of Utahans watched the announcement on big screen TVs at Washington Square Park and broke into wild cheers when the vote and announcement was made before dawn at 4:22 a.m. MDT.
A cauldron was lit at Rice-Eccles Stadium at the University of Utah to mark the games' return.
""It's a once in a generation opportunity,"" said Visit Salt Lake  President and CEO Kaitlin Eskelson. ""It's just a very exciting time and it's going to catapult us into that global stage."" 
This will mark the fifth time it's been held on American soil. The United States previously rolled out a winter red carpet in Lake Placid (1932 and 1980) and Squaw Valley (1960) in addition to Salt Lake City (2002 and 2034).
The IOC made a conditional award to France, pending additional financial guarantees from organizers, officials said.
If France gets the games, it would be the fourth time it has hosted the Winter Olympics, following Chamonix in 1924, Grenoble in 1968 and Albertville in 1992.
Not including the Summer Olympics, which get underway in Paris this week, the sites and dates for the next five sets of games are now largely set.
The naming of Salt Lake City and French Alps as the next two winter sites had been in the works for months, with only moderate concerns rooted in France's snap elections. 
But worries about the 2030 bid appeared to be eased when centrist French President Emmanuel Macron and leftist parties staved off a far-right challenge.David K. Li is a senior breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital."
NBC_46,"Netanyahu slams protesters, says war against Hamas is America's fight too",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/netanyahu-address-congress-first-time-oct-7-attack-israel-rcna163260,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday delivered an impassioned speech to Congress, taking on protesters inside the House chamber and hundreds gathered outside the Capitol, while emphasizing the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship.
It was his first address to U.S. lawmakers in nearly a decade and his first since Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of hostages to Gaza, where about 100 are still believed to be held captive.
Netanyahu's speech comes at a critical period: The U.S. is in the middle of a chaotic election year, and the Biden administration continues to push negotiators toward a cease-fire agreement that could end the war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health.
""My friends, I came to assure you today of one thing: We will win,"" Netanyahu, standing in the same spot where President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his ""Day of Infamy"" speech after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
""Like Dec. 7, 1941, and Sept. 11, 2001,"" Netanyahu said, ""Oct. 7 is a day that will forever live in infamy.""
Later he added: ""For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together.""
Netanyahu also directly addressed the protests against his handling of the war in Gaza, both on college campuses this spring and outside the Capitol. ""Incredibly, many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil. They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers,"" he said.
Protests against the war in Gaza, which has killed and maimed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians and displaced an estimated 90% of the enclave’s population, have swept the world and the halls of Congress. Roughly 40 Democrats in the House and the Senate boycotted the address, outraged at Netanyahu’s policies and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as the U.S.'s military support for it.
“He’s a war criminal!” progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. told NBC News.
He later accused the protesters in Washington of being funded by Iran, citing U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, who said in a statement earlier this month that the U.S. has ""observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters.""
Netanyahu said he had a message for the protesters: ""You have officially become Iran's useful idiots.""
Three months after Congress passed a military aid package that included $14 billion for Israel and with the U.S. presidential election around the corner, Netanyahu personally thanked the political leaders of both parties. 
He praised President Joe Biden, who he has known for 40 years and who has recently publicly criticized the prime minister's war strategy. There has also been growing frustration among members of the Biden administration at stalled ceasefire talks.
""I want to thank you for half a century of friendship to Israel and for being, as he says, 'a proud Zionist,"" Netanyahu said. ""Actually, he says, 'a proud Irish-American Zionist.'""
Netanyahu also thanked former President Donald Trump, who hopes to return to the White House next year.
The prime minister devoted some of his address to slamming the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for him and other Israeli leaders for war crimes, an action that drew condemnation from Biden and many in Congress, particularly Republicans.
The Israeli prime minister accused the ICC of libel, saying it is ""trying to shackle Israel’s hands and prevent us from defending ourselves. And if Israel’s hands are tied, America is next.""
He disputed the ICC's claim that Israel has deliberately targeted Palestinian civilians, saying Israel had warned civilians to evacuate before performing airstrikes. An April NBC News investigation into airstrikes, however, found Palestinians were killed in areas of southern Gaza that the Israeli military had explicitly designated as safe zones. NBC News crews compiled the GPS coordinates of strikes, all of which hit an area identified by the Israeli military as an evacuation zone in an online interactive map it published on Dec. 1. 
Netanyahu also pushed back on the ICC accusing Israel of intentionally trying to starve Palestinians in Gaza, saying that Israel not only isn’t blocking aid but that Hamas is stealing it.
In March, Mohamed Nossair, head of operations at the Egyptian Red Crescent, accused Israel of blocking aid: “They limit the number of trucks that can pass,” Nossairsaid of Israeli officials and soldiers charged with inspecting aid destined for Gaza. “The problem is also they reject these items ... that are very essential.”
Oxygen canisters, water filters, metal forks, over-the-counter painkillers and generators were among the items that Nossair said had prevented trucks from entering Gaza, where a vast majority of the people are displaced and more than 32,000 have been killed, according to local health officials.
“If I have a truck with rejected items, they reject all the truck,” Nossair said in an interview with NBC News.
Some of the families of American hostages attended the speech and have a planned meeting with Netanyahu and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in the afternoon. Six American hostage families are in Washington and said they are upset that Netanyahu made the trip rather than staying in Israel trying to get their loved ones home.
The families said they are looking toward a Thursday meeting at the White House with Biden and Netanyahu as a chance for the U.S. to pressure the prime minister to agree to a deal as soon as next week to end the war.
Vice President Kamala Harris is also expected to meet with Netanyahu at the White House this week. And on Friday morning, Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with former President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Palm Beach, Florida.
In the middle of the speech, progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian woman to serve in Congress, held up a small black and white sign at Netanyahu that read: ""War criminal"" and ""Guilty of genocide.""
At one point, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., and later a House security official, appeared to try to get Tlaib to take down her sign. But she continued to raise it throughout the speech. 
Capitol Police also escorted three people out of the chamber who were wearing yellow T-shirts reading ""SEAL THE DEAL NOW,"" likely a reference to a cease-fire agreement. They were put in zip-tie cuffs and taken away. Police said six people from the chamber were arrested.
Outside, Capitol Police deployed pepper spray on protesters. The department had erected the same fencing around the Capitol that was used after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Tuesday in anticipation of demonstrations.
Foreign leaders typically address Congress in coordination with official invitations from the president. But in this case, Johnson, in March publicly began pushing for a Netanyahu address to lawmakers amid pro-Palestinian protests and encampments that formed on college campuses this spring. 
The invite, months before the general election, underscored the GOP’s support for Israel and further drove a wedge between Democrats who’ve been divided over Netanyahu’s handling of the war in Gaza.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, the highest-ranking Jewish American in Washington who had called for new elections to replace Netanyahu, later sent the formal invitation with Johnson.
Harris, who as the president of the Senate would normally preside over such an address, is not attending the speech. Neither are several other prominent Democrats, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 leader. Retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., an Orthodox Jew and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, will preside over the address, instead.
Harris is scheduled to be in Indianapolis on Wednesday as she embarks on her presidential campaign now that Biden has dropped out of the race.
Johnson said Tuesday that it is “inexcusable” that Harris is skipping Netanyahu’s speech and that she should be “held accountable” for it. That criticism was echoed by Republicans in both chambers, but they did not take similar exception to Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Donald Trump's running mate, missing the speech.
Vance is missing Netanyahu’s speech because “he has duties to fulfill as the Republican nominee for Vice President,” Jason Miller, senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement.
While Netanyahu received a warm welcome from Republican lawmakers, it was more lukewarm from Democrats, some of whom boycotted his speech, outraged at his handling of the war and calling his address months before the election politicized and improper.
Pelosi ""will join a Members meeting with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terror attack and kidnappings,"" her spokesperson Ian Krager said in a statement.
Other top Democrats boycotting the address include Rep. James Clyburn, of South Carolina, the influential Black Caucus member, and Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. Other progressives like Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a member of the “squad,” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are also skipping the speech, as are several Jewish members of Congress, including Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. 
“The Hamas attack on October 7 was unprovoked and cowardly, and its continued holding of hostages unconscionable,” Durbin said in a statement. “However, Israel’s execution of its war in Gaza under the direction of Prime Minister Netanyahu with 39,000 Palestinians dead and 90,000 injured is a brutal strategy beyond any acceptable level of self-defense. ... I will stand by Israel, but I will not stand and cheer its current Prime Minister at tomorrow’s Joint Session.” 
Notably, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the president pro tempore of the Senate and another candidate to oversee a joint meeting of Congress, is not going, either. “Securing a lasting, mutual ceasefire is of the utmost importance right now, and I will continue to push for one to be reached as soon as possible,"" Murray said in a statement. ""I hope Prime Minister Netanyahu will use the opportunity to address how he plans to secure a ceasefire—and lasting peace in the region.”
Jayapal said Tuesday that she does not think Netanyahu is interested in peace in the Middle East.
“He certainly hasn’t had an interest in bringing home hostage families,” Jayapal said. “I think he’s — he may be shilling for Donald Trump, but, you know, that is at the cost of security for Israel, it’s at the cost of security for the Palestinians, and it’s at the cost of peace, more broadly, in the Middle East and certainly at the cost of bringing home the families of the hostages that are there, including the eight American hostages that still remain.""
Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., the first Generation Z member of Congress, will boycott the speech, as well. “I detest [Netanyahu's] leadership. I think what’s going on in Gaza is horrible,"" Frost said Tuesday. ""He opposes a two-state solution, which is what we are for as a country — it's the policy of our country. I don’t think he should have been invited in the first place.”
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is the first GOP lawmaker to say he’ll boycott the speech, saying on X, “The purpose of having Netanyahu address Congress is to bolster his political standing in Israel and to quell int’l opposition to his war.”
“I don’t feel like being a prop so I won’t be attending,” he said.
The top party leaders in each chamber — Schumer; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.; and Johnson — are all participating in a meeting with Netanyahu ahead of his speech.
“Even though I disagree with many of Bibi Netanyahu's policies,"" Schumer said, ""I will attend the speech because the United States relationship with Israel remains ironclad and transcends any prime minister or president, and we must do all we can to get our hostages home.""
Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., an ardent supporter of Israel who is attending, said he wanted to hear from Netanyahu about how he plans to bring the hostages home and what to do about Iran.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk attended the address a guest of Netanyahu, he said. Musk sat in the prime minister's section above the House floor, behind the his wife, Sarah Netanyahu.
Wednesday marks Netanyahu's fourth address to Congress, the most of any foreign leader in history. Winston Churchill, the legendary British prime minister, addressed Congress three times.  
Netanyahu last addressed Congress nearly a decade ago, in March 2015, in a similar political situation. Then-Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, had invited Netanyahu to address Congress about threats from Iran without consulting President Barack Obama. The White House slammed it as a breach of diplomatic protocol.
It's ""somewhat similar"" to Netanyahu's 2015 address, said Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. ""It seems like it's politics; it seemed that what Boehner did was trying to influence ... it was a political season then.""
U.S. Capitol Police warned that Wednesday's speech could draw ""a large number of demonstrators,"" according to U.S. Capitol Police.
The Capitol Police said it has enhanced security measures in place for protest and also swore in more than 200 New York police officers to assist in policing events this week in Washington, according to Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, who shared a video of the swearing-in on X.
On Tuesday, more than 200 Jewish Voice for Peace protesters were arrested after they demonstrated in one of the House office buildings and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans, Capitol Police said.
More than two dozen former senior officials who worked in Israel's security establishment — like the Mossad and Shin Bet — and Israeli businesses have also voiced opposition to Netanyahu's speaking before Congress. In a letter addressed to congressional leaders, obtained Tuesday by NBC News, they said they have ""grave concerns"" about the ""damage"" Netanyahu's visit will do to the U.S. and Israel's joint objectives. The letter's signers include former Mossad Director Tamir Pardo, former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon and former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff Dan Halutz, among others, some of whom worked under Netanyahu's leadership.
The Biden administration has continued working behind the scenes to try to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared to express some optimism late last week when he said the negotiators were ""driving toward the goal line.""Scott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.

NBC_47,Democrats are cautiously optimistic that they finally have the first female president,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-kamala-harris-first-female-president-clinton-trump-rcna163063,2024-07-24 18:00:19.122200,,"WASHINGTON — In Vice President Kamala Harris’ quick, if unorthodox, rise to the top of the Democratic ticket, elected officials, activists and operatives see in her a new chance to beat Donald Trump and make history in one swoop.
Eight years after Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Harris could be the first female president and the first Black woman to hold the nation’s top job, as well.
Democrats are somewhat optimistic, now set in a landscape they didn’t have in 2016: a messenger in Harris who is uniquely positioned to energize voters following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn national abortion rights, more proof from the ballot box that women can win in battleground areas and the knowledge that Trump himself is beatable — if still politically dangerous.
“The lessons that still apply [from 2016] are that people need to take Trump and his supporters seriously,” Shaunna Thomas, who co-founded and runs the pro-women group Ultraviolet, told NBC News. “That’s even more of a top-line message than whether or not a woman can win the presidency.”
In 2016, Clinton’s behemoth campaign and perceived air of inevitability left some Democrats unengaged and resting on their laurels. “I think we’re not going to leave anything on the field this time,” Thomas said.Now, many of the party operatives and groups who pushed for Clinton to be the first female president are working, to borrow a phrase from President Joe Biden, to “finish the job.”
“‘Let’s finish the job’ is actually for us, too, from 2016,” said Mini Timmaraju, who leads the pro-abortion-rights group Reproductive Freedom for All and was the women’s vote director on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “We ran and lost against Donald Trump and we suffered an incredible, horrific loss nationwide overturning Roe and so much damage to our country that this is sort of the ultimate fight back for us.”
A Harris victory in November would mean finishing the job that many of those operatives started with Clinton, one that extends further back to Shirley Chisholm, of New York, the first Black woman in Congress, who ran her own historic long-shot presidential bid in 1972.
“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice,” Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., who once worked to elect Chisholm and now backs Harris, told NBC News.
Harris, herself, has pointed to Chisholm as an inspiration, even having used colors in her 2020 campaign logo similar to those Chisholm did in her presidential run.
The influx of female lawmakers into Congress in 2018, as well as women who have risen to the top in key swing states, like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, also serve as counters to the “electability” argument that has been used against female candidates before, especially in Democratic primaries.“What is fundamentally different from 2016 and 2020: The first is Dobbs, and that’s huge. It just changes the dynamic all over the place,” said Christina Reynolds, senior vice president at EMILY’s List, who also worked on Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “But I also think we’re not in a primary. And that’s where ‘electability’ matters so much. … So it’s not a question of ‘who best stacks up against Trump?’ We’re just going to stack her up against Trump. And I like that contrast.”
Harris has urged voters and skeptics alike to be “unburdened by what has been” and believe that women leaders can win so long as voters support them.
After all, it has been eight years since a woman topped the Democratic ticket and broke the glass ceiling of becoming a major-party nominee, but an even more durable one still lies above, surrounding the presidency itself. The aftermath of Clinton’s shock 2016 loss bled into 2020’s Democratic presidential primaries, which hinged heavily on the idea of “electability” and whether any woman could beat Trump after one woman struggled to win by the Electoral College metric that mattered. Harris was one of five women who ran and lost in that primary campaign.
“You have one woman nominee for president who loses and everyone says, ‘Oh, I don’t know, can a woman win?’” said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., who is running for governor. “How many men have run for president and lost and nobody ever says that?”
Timmaraju made it clear that even amid the optimism, “we’re not naive,” referring to the sexism and racism that still exist for nonwhite, non-male candidates. “We’re eyes wide open.”
It has already led to some questions about whom Harris should choose as her running mate: lean in to history with a pick that highlights her history — be it as a woman or as a person of color — or go with what many in the party still consider as the “safer” choice, a white man?
In 2016, Clinton and her team briefly considered doubling down with two women on the ticket: Clinton and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Ultimately, Clinton picked Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. — even he described himself as “boring.”
“I thought about everything,” Clinton said in a 2022 interview for the book “Electable: Why America Hasn’t Put a Woman in the White House ... Yet,” acknowledging, as some of her aides also did, that there was a push to lean into the history of the moment.
“It was an upside-downside,” Clinton concluded then. “I mean, you would be asking a lot for the electorate to elect two women. That would be a huge step. On the other hand, it would be history-making and let’s roll the dice. But that’s not, in the end, why I made the decision to pick Tim Kaine. I was looking for somebody who — and I think this should be the primary consideration — could immediately be president. And he had the attributes that I thought really enabled me to envision him along with the country as stepping in to be president.”
This time around, there is similar excitement around the possibility of leaning in with a female pick, as well as hesitations around asking too much of the electorate.
“People always demand balance,” Reynolds said, looking back to President Barack Obama’s pick of Biden as his running mate.
The pick was meant to assuage experience concerns about Obama’s youth and relative inexperience, as well as bring a certain familiarity and comfort level to the ticket. But Biden was also a white man on a ticket with what would be the first Black president. Biden wasn’t “going to be saddled with the burden of racism that Obama was saddled with,” the thinking went, a person close to Obama said in an interview for “Electable.”
Even now, the list of Democrats floated as potential Harris running mates is overwhelmingly white and male, with just two Black men and a single woman among the names being floated publicly. Harris could well pick a surprise candidate, and she hasn’t said anything publicly about whom she is eyeing, but once again the conventional wisdom seems to be that the likely female nominee for president needs a politically moderate white man on the ticket to assuage potentially nervous voters.
“It tells you where we are in America,” said Rep. Jazmine Crockett, D-Texas. “But nevertheless.”
“It’s not like when we look at, traditionally, who ends up making up these tickets that there is a large bench of people of color,” Crockett said, pointing out that the U.S. still has yet to elect a Black female governor and that Wes Moore, of Maryland, remains the only Black man serving as a governor.
“I think that that’s also a problem that we need to solve. We need to start making sure that our benches are representative of who we are in this country and that it’s not a matter of the only people that are being elevated to the highest offices in the country tend to be white men,” Crockett said.
The demographic makeup of the bench aside, Harris’ backers were pleased to see so many Democrats — from Biden to Democratic leadership in Congress to some progressive rebels — all quickly line up behind her in recent days. It was a coronation of sorts that even her supporters say they couldn’t have imagined at the outset of her time in the administration — a period marked by criticisms, both fair and unfair, of the job she was doing. When Biden vowed in 2020 to choose a female running mate, women’s groups sprang into action immediately, organizing “We Have Her Back” in anticipation of the sexism and racism that any number of the potential picks could have faced. Now, many of the groups that were part of that effort don’t feel the same pressure to organize — though they will be ready if any of those attacks take over.
“She’s got all of us now,” Thomas said, referring to the full Democratic Party’s embrace of Harris.
For now, Democrats are focused on toppling Trump — and maybe the glass ceiling along with him.
“I feel very confident she’s going to win,” Spanberger said of Harris. “But if she doesn’t, it’s not because she’s a woman. Just as when Donald Trump loses, it’s not because he’s a man. It’s because he’s a terrible candidate who has terrible policies.”Ali Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington. She is the author of ""Electable: Why America Hasn’t Put a Woman in the White House ...

NBC_48,"After bowing out of the 2024 race, Biden embarks on a new project: Shaping his legacy",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-embarks-shaping-legacy-bowing-2024-race-rcna163333,2024-07-24 18:00:19.122200,,"WASHINGTON — For more than three at-times excruciating weeks, President Joe Biden and his team were locked in a campaign to save his candidacy. With his prime-time address to the nation Wednesday night, a new effort is underway: to shape his legacy.
A team of Biden’s closest advisers is already at work to plot out what that will look like. The discussion includes domestic priorities he could advance in coming budget negotiations with Congress or through executive action, diplomatic initiatives he could see through with a freer hand and accomplishing what he has described as the most elusive of the three goals he outlined in his 2020 campaign — unifying the country.
NBC News spoke to a half-dozen White House and campaign officials about what Biden is planning, and advisers said they recognize that the biggest factor shaping how he is viewed in history will be whether Vice President Kamala Harris is successful in her bid to succeed him.
“Everything is being viewed through that lens,” a White House official said.In the earliest stages of this new phase, Harris campaign and Biden administration officials describe a thus far seamless approach to advancing both of their goals at once. There has been no explicit directive to Biden aides to run major decisions by Harris’ team for approval — but they have been collaborating nonetheless to make sure to row in the same direction.
Some of that is by necessity more than design — Harris’ team on the campaign and in the White House had been a much smaller part of the larger operation. But it also reflects the experience of personnel on both sides — especially long-standing relationships between Sheila Nix, who was overseeing Harris’ campaign team, and top Biden advisers she once worked alongside when he was vice president during the Obama administration.
It builds on the approach taken shortly after Biden's poor debate performance on June 27, when the White House publicized Biden and Harris' having lunch and added her to an Independence Day event, as well as Biden's oft-repeated remarks about how Harris was ready to be president.
Her team likewise took extra care not to make any moves that could be perceived as planning for her own potential candidacy, for fear it would be seen as disloyal, a senior adviser said.
Both camps understand there has been something of a honeymoon period that may not last. But it is nonetheless an important moment to execute successfully to try to develop momentum that can carry her forward.
It began with Harris' offering a tribute to Biden on Monday, describing his record in a single term in office as rivaling or surpassing those of most two-term presidencies. Now, Biden’s Oval Office speech presents a critical opportunity to speak to the American people as they view him no longer as an embattled candidate but as a humbled, soon-to-be former president.
Part of his message Wednesday night will build on the Oval Office address he delivered just over a week ago — after the attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump — about the need for the country to come together despite an often-bitter election campaign. For weeks, though, Biden has been most at odds with his own party.
After he announced nine years ago that he would not be a candidate in the 2016 election, Biden told the country that no one should commit to seek the presidency unless he or she could commit “110%” to the effort. In private, Biden acknowledged as he made the decision to leave the 2024 race that he could no longer fight a two-front war if he stayed in it — against his party and against Trump.
Biden officials described going through a range of emotions since they learned of his decision not to seek a second term. There was shock at the decision itself, which in retrospect seemed inevitable but for weeks they worked hard to avoid. There was anger, especially at Democratic leaders whom they viewed as betraying what they saw as Biden's loyalty to the party by pressuring him to drop out. And there was sadness amid concern that — as Biden himself put it often — the 90-minute debate in June would perhaps overshadow a career of committed public service.
But the time for sentimentality is short, as a senior campaign official put it. And Biden’s speech offers, especially for his team in the White House, a rallying point for its remaining months in office.
White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, speaking to White House staff members this week, said that in every conversation he had with him, Biden directed him to continue pushing forward on priorities like working to lower costs, implementing major legislation like the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act and standing up for democracy. 
A source close to Biden said he will also reprise another message he offered after he declined to run in 2016: that while he will not be a candidate, he is not going to stop engaging in the public debate.
In some ways, Biden's political obituary was already written eight years ago as he prepared to depart the vice presidency. There were a rousing tribute at that year’s Democratic convention, a daylong event in the Senate, where he had also served for 36 years, and President Barack Obama's awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The latter two events were tempered, though, by the shock of Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton.
Wednesday’s speech will be just the first in a series of farewell messages Biden will have a chance to deliver, including next month at a Democratic National Convention being retooled to focus on Harris and her eventual running mate. He will also have the traditional presidential farewell address in the closing days of his term, when aides hope he will truly be preparing to pass the baton to a President-elect Harris.Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent. "
NBC_49,Plane crash at Nepal's Kathmandu airport kills 18,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/plane-crash-nepal-kathmandu-airport-passengers-killed-rcna163384,2024-07-24 17:00:19.122200,,"A domestic plane crashed Wednesday just after taking off from the airport serving Nepal’s capital Kathmandu, killing 18 people and injuring a pilot who was the lone survivor. 
Police official Basanta Rajauri said authorities have pulled out all 18 bodies. The only survivor was the pilot, who was taken to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, said a doctor at the hospital who was not authorized to speak to media.
The pilot has injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger, the doctor said.
A press statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the Saurya Airlines plane had taken off at 11:11 a.m. from Kathmandu and was heading to resort town of Pokhara. 
The plane had already taken off and turned right before it crashed in the eastern section of the airport, the statement said.
The bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board, among them there was only one female. The crew and 16 passengers were Nepali nationals with one identified as foreigner but no nationality was disclosed.
Tribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crew and investigators began their work.It is monsoon rainy season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.
Saurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes.
The Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots and bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city. The airport is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods. 
In 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in “sheer desperation” when the plane crashed. 
In 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.The Associated Press"
NBC_50,Chuck Todd: How Harris can use her VP search to define herself,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/chuck-todd-harris-can-use-vp-search-define-rcna163195,2024-07-24 17:00:19.122200,,"Building an airplane as it takes off is no way to build an airplane. And yet, sometimes, circumstances dictate that you have no choice but to try.
Of all the potential metaphors to use and abuse in this unprecedented moment, that’s probably the best one. Building a national campaign isn’t easy. It’s also exactly what Kamala Harris and the Democrats are doing with just over 100 days until Election Day.
Harris tried it once herself and experienced some ups but a lot more downs. She’s getting a massive head start this time compared to her 2020 primary campaign, thanks to what has turned into an almost seamless handoff from President Joe Biden to the new de facto Democratic nominee.
The Democratic National Committee seems set on trying to nominate Harris and her eventual running mate in a virtual delegate roll call before the actual convention begins. While I understand some of party leaders’ technical concerns around state laws and waiting until the start of the convention to officially nominate Harris and her running mate, it seems like an unnecessary step given the circumstances. The Democrats should welcome any GOP attempts to block Harris from a state ballot, because voters wouldn’t love the look, because there’s nothing about what the Democrats are doing that’s illegal or even unprecedented.
In fact, it used to be normal for the parties to wait until their conventions to certify their nominees, so while this is an unprecedented situation for the 21st century, it’s not abnormal in the grand scheme of things. And while there was a rush to hurry up and consolidate support behind a new nominee, there is now time to take a breath and start being a tad more methodical.
The question is what Harris does between now and the start of her convention in Chicago. The biggest decision she has to make in this short amount of time is choosing a running mate, and while speed has been the name of the game in the transition from Biden to Harris, there’s no need to rush the choice nearly as fast as they’ve rushed the coronation for the top of the ticket.
If done right, a methodical yet efficient veepstakes could help reintroduce Harris to the country and allow voters — particularly those who start in the skeptical middle — a chance to take a measure of her. Many voters will look at whom she surrounds herself with and whom she wants to associate herself with as ways to see how she’d govern. She’s being handed a gift in some ways with this opportunity to name a running mate. And she needs to use this time to introduce herself on her own terms.
Harris’ challenge isn’t a new issue for sitting vice presidents. Even with months to prepare, vice presidents have always struggled with the burden of being famous without being known. Folks know her name, know her position and perhaps have a singular semi-uninformed hot take (positive or negative) on her — and that’s it. She has to fill in the blanks before the Trump campaign and the GOP fills them in for her. It’s a race to define her.
And that’s why the veepstakes shouldn’t be rushed. This is an opportunity for Americans to get a glimpse at the type of Democrats she wants to run the country. This isn’t just about picking a running mate. This is about setting a tone for the type of politics she intends to practice — how ideology and practicality will weigh against each other, which issues will display her pragmatism and which issues will prompt a fight until the bitter end. Harris can tease out all of these things through a strategic use of the veepstakes process.
With the Olympics starting Friday, there will be a mini-lull in the public’s focus on politics for two weeks. It’s a perfect time for Harris to stage her own contest — a political pentathlon — for a running mate. She doesn’t need to go full “Apprentice,” à la Donald Trump, but she also shouldn’t shy away from media coverage of various candidates.
She can interview candidates whom she may never intend to pick, but she might end up interviewing a future Cabinet secretary or chief of staff.
And she can use the veepstakes to throw some bones to various constituencies. For instance, she ought to have a face-to-face with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney soon, a meeting that “leaks” in which they talk about their “shared concern about the democracy” and about what role Cheney can play either in her campaign or in the next administration. She never even has to say it’s about the vice presidency (because it won’t be about the vice presidency), but let others speculate. It’s a no-lose virtue signal to the center-right “Never Trumpers.”
Maybe she heads to Dallas for a fundraiser and sits down with businessman Mark Cuban. Again, is it for the VP slot? Let others speculate! But at a minimum, she signals to the business community that she has her own relationships with some interesting folks in their world. Cuban’s got a health care proposal he’s been pushing for years, so there is substance he’d want to sit down with her about.
Do I think Cuban or Cheney would be good running mates for her? Probably not. Both are inexperienced in some of the nuances of Democratic constituency politics (not to mention there are some deep ideological disagreements with Cheney), and the learning curve in this era would be tough. But again, this isn’t just about picking a vice presidential running mate. This is about Harris introducing the country to herself and to folks who could or would be in her kitchen cabinet.
The larger point is this: There is a caricature of Harris that isn’t great for her. Republicans want to take that simple caricature of the San Francisco progressive and make it her permanent political identity. She needs to fight some of the stereotypes about her politics, and there’s no better way to do that than to start having one-on-ones with a broad array of folks who could help reshape any negative narratives some voters might have of her.
Another couple of nontraditional names I’d include on her listening tour of sorts when it comes to building her team: retired military leaders like Adm. Bill McRaven and Mark Milley, the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Again, I don’t think either makes sense in a short campaign as an actual running mate. But sending the signal that these are the type of leaders she’s approaching for advice could assuage skeptics in the middle and the center right, the two groups of voters who truly are the swing votes in this election.
Now, I’m focusing on some nontraditional names to serve up to the veepstakes media frenzy — but that doesn’t mean I think Harris should go a nontraditional route for her running mate.
Ultimately, she needs to pick someone she clicks with — i.e., don’t make the mistake Biden made with her. It’s fairly obvious now that the two never really clicked, but Biden sort of boxed himself into picking her with some public and private promises he made during the 2020 campaign. And ultimately, Harris was a “do no harm” pick that ostensibly sent the message that he was giving a nod to the next generation of Democratic leaders after him.
To me, there are three obvious short-listers, and then there’s everybody else. The three candidates who make the most sense to me are Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. All of them would create some perceived ideological balance for Harris, as all appear to be slightly to the right of her politically. All three have demonstrated an ability to win over Trump voters in their campaigns. And if you believe the swing vote is center-right women and college-educated white men, then one of these three would make a lot of sense.
For me, the next set of folks on the so-called shortlist, at least on paper, feel like tier two, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. All three would bring similar skill sets, but they would arguably bring fewer intangibles compared to the trio in my tier one. However, you can’t rule out the possibility Harris simply clicks with one candidate more than anyone else. If that’s the case, she shouldn’t let the electoral map cloud her judgment. Ultimately, if you don’t pick the candidate you’re most comfortable with, you won’t be successful either as a ticket or as an administration.
Turning back to the three I put in my top tier: The one who has the most “pros” when it comes to filling in the deficits Harris brings to the campaign appears to be Kelly. The one issue Trump will pound Harris on is the border. Well, Kelly spent much of his 2022 re-election campaign distancing himself from the Biden-Harris administration on the border, and he was very critical of its policies publicly. Toss in Kelly’s two hard-hitting and high-profile campaigns for the Senate in 2020 and 2022, and he has been tested in a way many of the other candidates on the so-called shortlist haven’t.
Then there’s the résumé: Combat veteran and astronaut are pretty unimpeachable jobs in politics. Throw in his marriage to Gabby Giffords, the former Democratic congresswoman who basically brought him into politics, and you can see why the “pro” list for Kelly is a bit longer than for anyone else. I laid out the case for Beshear last week, including his experience beating an incumbent governor in 2019, Matt Bevin, who was known as “Trump before Trump.” Now, is there an obvious state he helps in? It depends on whether he could speak to a more rural constituency in the Midwest battlegrounds that chipped away at the Trump margins. It’s possible to do that in governor’s races, harder to do as the No. 2 in a presidential election.
As for Shapiro, ultimately, I think his biggest “con” is that he has been a governor for less than two years. If he were in his second term, he might make more sense. But the one big thing he’s known for so far is his quick fix of I-95 after the partial collapse in Philadelphia last year.
The initial list that’s being bandied about in and around the Harris campaign is a strong list on paper, so she should feel comfortable being methodical about this. Again, there’s no rush; the DNC is creating an artificial deadline (in my opinion) that could force a rushed pick for running mate that ultimately backfires.
Harris should take her time and let the public get to know her governing style and philosophy through the meetings she has with people who may or may not be on the running mate shortlist. At a minimum, she would get a head start on any future transition if she’s fortunate enough to turn this campaign around and pull the upset over Trump.
It has been just over a week since Trump picked Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, and one can already sense a tinge of regret among some forces in Trump world. Of course, Vance wasn’t a popular choice among the more pragmatic members of the campaign. Those forces wanted either Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin or, frankly, anyone not named Vance. The concern these more pragmatic campaign types had about Vance is that the pick ideologically defines the party in a direction that doesn’t thrill a lot of Republicans. It’s not just the international isolationism; it’s also Vance’s support for more aggressive economic nationalism.
But so far, the Vance rollout has been “meh” at best. His speech wasn’t great at the convention, and it was made worse because he was inexperienced at riding applause to keep the attention of the people who matter the most during convention speeches: the audience at home. He allowed himself to get drawn into too many crowd conversations that simply left viewers out of the loop at times. And it certainly wasn’t much of a stem-winder.
Of course, Trump didn’t pick Vance for the campaign. He picked him to send a message about the future of the party and to put his legacy stamp on its direction.
In the meantime, the campaign is going to have to deploy Vance more strategically, as he fires up the MAGA base and little more than that. The more he gets drawn into the national debate, especially on abortion, the more he’s going to struggle.
Check out this quote he gave to his traveling news corps when he was asked about abortion: “I’m the vice presidential nominee, not the presidential nominee, and if I want my views on abortion to dominate the Republican Party, then I’d run for president. I didn’t and I haven’t. Donald Trump ran for president. And I think that it’s important that as a party we say the voters have decided here. Trump, having won, gets to decide what the party’s platform is … which is an emphasis on states making the decision.”
That’s a great answer for Vance’s 2028 primary campaign as he attempts to win over social conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina. But it’s a terrible answer in a general election.
I admire the honesty of his answer, and it’s a reminder that vice presidents have to defend records they wouldn’t necessarily advocate on their own (Harris is finding out about this herself). But Democrats will use that answer and flip the age script right back on the Trump-Vance ticket. I can easily see Democrats running ads saying that if Trump doesn’t finish his term, Vance would be president and he would pursue an abortion ban. In the same way the Trump campaign wanted to use Biden’s age and Harris’ unpopularity against that ticket (when it existed), now the Democrats have the ammunition to flip the script and do so on an issue that very much animates voters: abortion.Chuck Todd is NBC News' chief political analyst and the former moderator of ""Meet The Press."""
NBC_51,"As Harris' campaign ramps up, Trump and allies sharpen race- and gender-based attacks",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/republican-attacks-kamala-harris-center-race-gender-dumb-dei-candidate-rcna162570,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"When President Joe Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid and throwing his support to his vice president, Kamala Harris, the dynamics of the entire presidential race radically shifted. 
No longer was it two white men born in the 1940s facing off — again — for who should return to the White House. Instead, it’s between Trump, a man who is 78, against Harris, who is 59 and would make history as the first woman and first woman of color to be president if she is elected. 
And within a day, Harris was already facing attacks that centered on her race and gender, making it clear that while Republicans may try to tie her to some of Biden’s policies, she will face criticisms he never did. 
It is some of the same playbook that Trump and his allies ran the last time a woman was on top of a major-party ticket. In 2016, Hillary Clinton’s qualifications, look and voice were also scrutinized. But this time, Republicans are also going after the background of Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. 
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called Harris a “DEI vice president” on social media, referring to workplace policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives have maligned. 
“When you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that’s what they have right now,” Burchett told CNN. 
Sebastian Gorka, a host on the conservative network Newsmax who served in the Trump administration, said Harris was going to be the nominee “because she’s female and her skin color is the correct DEI color.” He also said she “cackles like an insane woman.”
Fox News host Jesse Watters said Harris secured Hillary Clinton’s endorsement, “obviously, because she’s a woman.”
And Richard Grenell, U.S. ambassador to Germany in the Trump administration, told NBC News that Harris was part of a “revolving door of DEI appointments from the straight white male governor, who hands out appointments to keep different groups happy and at bay,” referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat. “Kamala Harris is a product of this whole system. She’s very far left, unvetted and untested.”
Before she became vice president, Harris won two terms as a district attorney in California and was elected three times statewide as attorney general and then U.S. senator. Trump, who had a successful career in real estate and entertainment, had no government experience before he became president.

In 2016, Trump repeatedly accused Clinton of playing the “woman’s card” to get where she is, going after her “strength” and “stamina” and mocking her voice. 
“She’s got nothing else going on,” he said of his opponent, who had been a senator from New York and secretary of state. “And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5% of the vote.”
“If she didn’t play the woman’s card she would have no chance, I mean zero, of winning,” he said on another occasion. 
“The only thing she’s got going is the fact that she’s a woman,” Trump also said in an interview with NBC’s “Today” show.
Trump brought out a “card” attack against Harris on Tuesday, but this time, it was the “race card.”
On a call hosted by the Republican National Committee, Trump said Harris “played the race card on a level you rarely see” during the Democratic primary debates with Biden in the 2020 election. 
“It’s a well-worn playbook for him,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney, who was a spokesperson for Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “But the reality is we also know that people wouldn’t use the playbook if it didn’t work to some degree.”
“Even in 2016, there were so many times it was so over the top and so disgusting. But I think coming against Kamala Harris, and perhaps it will be both race and gender ... maybe the combination of both is what will stand out to people,” she added. “And I think the country is changing, and it’s going to be more blatant to people how disgusting and inappropriate it is.”
In a statement, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Harris was “just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden — and she’s also dangerously liberal.”
“A vote for Kamala is a vote for more crime, inflation, open borders, high gas prices, and war around the world, and our team will make sure every American knows it,” she added. 
Going after DEI policies wasn’t yet in vogue in 2016, but the current criticism echoes the attacks that Clinton wasn’t qualified enough. On Monday, the New York Post reported that Trump told it in an interview that Harris was “vicious” and “dumb.” 
On Monday, Trump called Harris “Dumb as a Rock” on social media, and for years, he has consistently mispronounced her first name (as did many other speakers at last week’s Republican National Convention).  
In 2016, Trump also said Clinton didn’t have “the look” to be president — but she wasn’t the only one to face those insults. He also mocked his primary opponent Carly Fiorina for having a “face” that voters wouldn’t want to choose.
Trump has long insulted his opponents, including men. But the insults directed at Clinton echoed attacks that women in positions have power have long faced, questioning their qualifications, strength and appearance. 
Defending Fiorina — whom he had named as his running mate, even though he hadn't won the GOP presidential nomination — Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said at the time: “Donald has a problem with strong women. This is not subtle; it’s not complicated.” 
Cruz, another person who once had an acrimonious relationship with Trump after he ran against him in the 2016 primaries, has since put aside those differences and is backing him this time around. 
In a New York Times op-ed Tuesday, Clinton addressed the ""sexism and double standards"" that ""strong women candidates"" face in politics. 
""I’ve been called a witch, a 'nasty woman' and much worse. I was even burned in effigy. As a candidate, I sometimes shied away from talking about making history. I wasn’t sure voters were ready for that. And I wasn’t running to break a barrier; I was running because I thought I was the most qualified to do the job,"" she wrote. 
""Ms. Harris will face unique additional challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket. That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid. It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible,"" Clinton added. 
Harris has also already faced comments centered on her race and gender from Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. In 2020, Trump promoted the baseless “birther” conspiracy theory that Harris — who was born in the U.S. — isn’t eligible to be president because her parents were born in other countries. Trump has also pushed birther conspiracy theories about Cruz, former President Barack Obama and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. 
In 2021, Vance went after Democrats who don’t have biological children of their own, calling them “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He mentioned Harris — who has two stepchildren, Cole and Ella — along with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. 
“How does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” he said at the time. 
His spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told The Associated Press, “It’s well known that Senator Vance found success in life due in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother.”
Former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile said, “The most convenient playbook in American politics has always been race, and race is always going to be a driver of conversation.
“But this is no time to go back using a playbook from the 20th century,"" she added. “We’re in the 21st century. ... I don’t believe that the American people are interested in a conversation that will further divide and further polarize us.”
Some Republicans also quickly criticized the conservative attacks on Harris on Tuesday. 
“I disagree with DEI, but she is the vice president of the United States. She is the former U.S. senator. These congressmen saying it, they are wrong in their own instincts,” former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told NBC News Tuesday.
Asked for comment for this article, the Harris campaign pointed to comments from Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. 
“Of course it’s not appropriate, for heaven’s sakes. What, are they just going to say if you’re not a white male, it’s a DEI candidate?” she told HuffPost on Tuesday. “I’m sorry. No.”Amanda Terkel is politics managing editor for NBC News Digital."
NBC_52,What happens inside Olympic Villages? These athletes gave us a tour,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/olympic-villages-athletes-tour-what-happens-rcna157847,2024-07-24 17:00:19.122200,,"The Olympic Games are beamed to billions of people around the world, giving viewers a real-time, close-up look at every pole vault, layup, breaststroke and backflip.
But there is a crucial part of the Olympics experience that remains largely unknown to spectators, sealed off from the camera crews and off-limits to cheering fans — the Olympic Village.
In recent weeks, NBC News spoke with decorated Olympians about life inside the sprawling residential complexes where thousands of athletes sleep, eat, train and socialize. They likened the villages to summer camps, college dorms, crowded hotels and — in the words of gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz — a “gigantic cruise ship.”
No two villages are exactly alike, but in the mind of gold medalist gymnast Shannon Miller, there is a clear-cut constant. “The one thing that hasn’t changed is that the Olympic Village is truly an athlete’s home away from home,” she said. 
The athletes’ villages in Paris span parts of three towns — Saint-Denis, Saint Ouen and L’Île-Saint-Denis. They will house 14,250 athletes during the Olympic Games and some 8,000 athletes during the Paralympic Games.
But the temporary homes where world class competitors dwell typically aren’t all that luxurious, as most Olympians are quick to point out.
“I think people would be surprised at how minimal and minimalist the Olympics rooms are,” said gold medalist figure skater Brian Boitano, who competed at Winter Games in Sarajevo, Calgary and Lillehammer.
Boitano, 60, recalled that his room at the 1994 Lillehammer Games was “maybe 6-feet-by-12 feet,” adding: “You hardly had an area to unpack your bags. I always laugh thinking about the mattresses. In some of the Olympic Villages, the mattresses were literally just foam. You think: This is the most important competition of my life and I’m sleeping on a foam mattress!”
This year, athletes will doze off on cardboard beds that Paris organizers say are designed for sustainability — part of a wider effort to make the Games more environmentally conscious. (The rooms were built without air-conditioning systems in a bid to cut carbon emissions, but many competitors are reportedly bringing their own mobile AC units.)Gus Kenworthy, a British American dual citizen who skied for the U.S. at the 2014 Sochi Games and the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, said he and his Sochi teammates tried to spruce up their rooms with Team USA duvet covers, pillowcases and other paraphernalia.
“It’s obviously a big push to get the Olympics done, so some things take a lower priority,” Kenworthy said. “In my second Games, at Pyeongchang, our apartment had a picture of an oven and a picture of a refrigerator. They had installed the cabinetry but they hadn’t put in the appliances. It was very strange. It was almost like a Fisher-Price play kitchen or something,” he added with a laugh.
Spitz, 74, described the lodgings at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as “a bunch of high-rise apartment complexes” bedeviled by a frequently broken elevator.
“In each bedroom, there were four people,” Spitz said. “Two sets of cots — doubles — maybe a pinch smaller than twin-size beds. No furniture. No kitchens. … They had bathrooms, obviously, but everything had what I’d call the low-cost IKEA look.”Each host city comes up with a plan for housing athletes — sometimes in Spartan condominiums, sometimes in emptied-out college dorms, sometimes in makeshift mobile units. 
In certain cases, athletes find the simple bedrooms conducive to the intense focus needed to perform at the highest level. The tight quarters can also foster immediate bonds among roommates, Boitano said. “In Calgary, sharing that tiny apartment with seven guys — we were such a tight unit, he said, “and there was so much camaraderie.”
The athletes who spoke to NBC News described the Olympic Village cafeteria as the bustling center of social activity, a festive gathering space where competitors can introduce themselves, break bread with people from other countries, and fuel up for the high-stakes events.“It’s kind of the heart of the Olympic Village,” Boitano said. Kenworthy, who most recently competed for England at the 2022 Beijing Games, agreed: “The kitchen is the heart of the home, and it’s that way at the Olympics.”
Hannah Roberts, who earned a silver medal in BMX freestyle at the Covid-era 2020 Tokyo Games, discovered that the cafeteria was already crammed with athletes as early as 4 a.m. “I was like, oh my goodness. You can’t get a space,” Roberts told the NBC Sports podcast “In The Village” in 2021.
Bonnie Blair, a gold medalist speed skater who competed at four Olympic Games over a 10-year period, described feeling like “a kid in a candy store” when she first walked into the dining hall at the 1984 Sarajevo Games.
“I just wanted to go to the cafeteria and sometimes I could hang out there for hours, because that’s where all the athletes were — athletes from other sports that you watched and admired, looked up to and all that.”
Blair, 60, said her favorite memory from that Olympics was the afternoon she spent having lunch with figure skater Scott Hamilton and twin brother ski racers Phil and Steve Mahre: “I felt like I had died and gone to heaven.”
“Those guys don’t remember having lunch with me, but I for sure remember having lunch with them,” Blair said. “I was this up-and-coming athlete, inquisitive about what they were doing, and I’m sure I asked them a gazillion questions. They were probably like: Oh my God, who is this kid?”
Miller recalled that the cafeteria at the 1992 Barcelona Games had virtually every kind of cuisine imaginable — and, maybe more importantly, a reminder of home for a 15-year-old girl from Oklahoma.
“I was missing my parents and family. I was missing home,” Miller said. Then, one day, she happened to sit by gold medalist wrestler Kendall Cross. “He shared that he was from Oklahoma,” she said. “I almost cried.”
Spitz took note of the virtually 24/7 food service during the 1968 Mexico City Games, with dishes ranging from local Mexican specialties to American staples like steak and eggs. “They have a little city’s worth of people that need to be fed,” Spitz said. “It’s like a gigantic cruise ship.” 
In the 1990s and 2000s, McDonald’s was a staple of Olympic Villages, regularly drawing long lines of athletes hoping to load up on carbohydrates before a grueling competition or celebrate a win with a quick-fix taste of American fast food. (The official partnership between the cheeseburger giant and the Games has since ended.)
In some cases, athletes can be more particular about their dining options. Dorothy Hamill, 67, the gold medalist figure skater, said the French competitors at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck brought along their own chef — “and, come to think of it,” she added, “I think they had their own wine.”
This year, French athletes obviously won’t need to go far for a taste of home. The restaurants and cafes inside the Paris village will serve up to 40,000 meals a day, and an “authentic bakery” will be open to Olympians who want to learn how to make fresh baguettes, according to organizers. 
The things Olympians do between official events tell you a lot about the spirit of the times. Hamill, who competed in Innsbruck in the era of the Bee Gees and “Saturday Night Fever,” remembered that her village featured a disco — though she never actually set foot inside. 
“I think our dorm was far enough away that we didn’t really hear,” she said, “but you could always tell when the party was really gearing up.”
Blair, who competed at the Olympics amid the rise of personal computing, flashed back to the hours spent tooling around on the early version of what was once called the World Wide Web.
“I remember in Albertville we had some sort of communication system on a computer where you could send messages to other athletes that were at the Olympics,” she said. “I remember sitting next to Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan on neighboring computers, and that’s where I got to know them.”
The breaks between competitions and meals leave room for athletes to watch other sports, catch up on highlights — and, in recent years, try to go viral.
Ilona Maher, a rugby sevens player who competed at the 2020 Tokyo Games, passed the time making viral TikToks with her teammates and “testing out those cardboard beds,” as she told the “In The Village” podcast in 2021. In one TikTok, she and her teammates evaluated how one bed could withstand yoga poses, skipping, “dramatic fainting” and clap push-ups. (The bed survived.)
The vibe during downtime tends to be loose and friendly. Boitano fondly remembered a supportive atmosphere where “all the American athletes are rooting for each other and they go to each other’s events.” He said athletes at his Games tended to leave encouraging notes for each other (“Good luck on your next race!”) on bulletin boards.
But that’s not to say that elite athletes lose their competitive edge when they’re hanging out inside the village. Alexi Pappas, a Greek-American runner who represented Greece at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, told The New York Times that athletes can turn cutthroat on a dime in the village’s game lounge. 
“When you challenge a Russian weightlifter to a game of ping pong (like my dad did), you will probably lose,” Pappas said. “Even though there is not a medal at stake here in the game lounge, it is nearly impossible for Olympic athletes not to try their best. It comes from the same immutable competitive instincts as my determination to always peel my oranges in a single peel. We can’t help it.”
Of course, Olympic Villages often attract speculation about other behind-the-scenes activities.
“The condoms! That’s what everybody wants to know,” Blair said. ‘Oh, everybody’s having sex in the villages. The condoms! They’re out of condoms!’ But that’s not what the village is really all about.”
“I went to four Olympics and I don’t feel like: Oh, there’s just tons of sex going on. I’m sure there’s … things that happen. But it’s not like it’s all that happens,” she added with a laugh.
Ryan Lochte, the record-holding swimmer, seemed to suggest otherwise in a 2012 interview with ESPN Magazine, telling the publication that he estimated “70 percent to 75 percent of Olympians” are having sex during the Games. 
“Hey, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do,” Lochte was quoted as saying.
Boitano, who told NBC News he “didn’t know anybody who was hooking up,” said he understood why the idea of hundreds of athletes pairing off inside the Olympic Villages regularly captures the public imagination. 
“It’s a romantic idea, all these hot athletes in the primes of their lives all hooking up,” Boitano said. “I can understand why it’s out there and why people run with it.”
Ultimately, as gold medalist swimmer Summer Sanders told ESPN, most Olympians abide by a simple motto: “What happens in the village stays in the village.”Daniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News."
NBC_53,What it means to be a Black Olympian representing the U.S. on the global stage,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/means-black-olympian-representing-us-global-stage-rcna158890,2024-07-24 17:00:19.122200,,"At the Olympic Games this summer, Black athletes will take to the world stage in Paris outfitted in red, white and blue, representing the United States with stars and stripes stamped across their uniforms.
Black athletes will be some of the most high-profile Olympians at the Paris Summer Games. Simone Biles will be making her highly awaited return to the mat, LeBron James will carry the American flag at the opening ceremony Friday, and track star Noah Lyles will set his sights on overtaking Usain Bolt’s gold medal records.
On the road to the Paris Games, Black Olympians spoke with NBC News about the special obligations of Black athletes representing the United States and stepping up as role models. 
When Crystal Dunn steps onto the field as the veteran defender on the U.S. women’s national soccer team, she’s not just playing for herself, she said.  
“The way that I choose to carry myself in every game, and every moment on the field, I feel like I know I’m not just playing for just me, I’m playing for girls that look like me, and maybe for girls who are fearful of staying in the sport because they don’t feel like they’re welcomed,” Dunn told NBC News in April.
Dunn is headed to her third Olympic Games with Team USA, but the soccer star remembers growing up on Long Island, New York, and not seeing many other Black athletes. “I was that young Black girl who looked around, too, and didn’t see a lot of people who looked like me,” Dunn recalled.
While Dunn played on the 2019 World Cup-winning squad, she has not won an Olympic gold medal. After the beloved team’s loss at the World Cup last year, Dunn said the team is ready for the world stage. “I think the team is in a really good position to put our best foot forward,” Dunn said. 
Two-time Olympian Ashleigh Johnson said the longer she plays water polo, the less it becomes about her. 
“As a Black woman of Caribbean descent in this sport, I definitely feel a special obligation to be a light for little Black and brown girls — and boys — who may be interested in swimming and water polo,” Johnson told NBC News in May. 
At times, being the only Black athlete on the national team had felt isolating, Johnson said. But now, as Johnson gears up for her third Olympic Games, she has embraced her role as a trailblazer in the sport.
“You end up realizing you have the power to change that and to make it a welcoming space for other Black people or brown people who may come after you,” she said.
Frederick Richard’s parents put him into gymnastics at age 2 because he was inspired by the tricks he’d seen in his older sister’s classes. Now, as he leads Team USA in Paris, Richard himself is inspiring kids to get into the sport. 
“There’s a lot of Black kids that wanted to get into the sport or don’t know how to or kind of don’t have someone to look up to, and my content has been that for them,” Richard said to NBC News in June. “Just to learn about me, see what I’m doing, kind of get inspired. And that’s pretty crazy to think about and see.”
Richard, who scored highest in the all-around category at the Olympic trials, is also inspiring fans beyond competitions. On TikTok, Richard’s videos in the gym have garnered millions of views. 
For Richard, bringing the sport to a broader audience is an opportunity for men’s gymnastics, where “you don’t get the recognition compared to other sports.” Men’s gymnastics has only 15 remaining NCAA programs in the U.S.
Going forward, Richard hopes to use his position to expand gymnastics — specifically to Black and underprivileged children. “I’ve gotten this opportunity because of it [gymnastics], and I want to make those things happen for other people,” Richard said. 
Olympian Jordan Chiles said she nearly quit the sport as a young gymnast due to racist comments from coaches. 
“I wanted to be done, because I didn’t think ... the sport wanted me,” Chiles said on NBC’s “My New Favorite Olympian” podcast in June. 
Now, she’s competing at the Summer Games for the second time — this year, on the most racially diverse team in the history of U.S. women’s Olympic gymnastics.
According to NCAA data from last year, just 8% of female college gymnasts and 7% of gymnastics head coaches were Black.
After the Tokyo Olympics, Chiles joined the University of California, Los Angeles’ gymnastics team and scored a perfect 10 at the NCAA Los Angeles regional final with ’90’s hip-hop music for her routine instead of a more traditional approach. 
Through a career celebrating Black culture, from her floor routines to her Beyoncé-inspired leotard, Chiles said she is hoping to inspire future generations of gymnasts at the Olympics in Paris.
“I’ve had times where I look at them in their faces and I’m just like, ‘You are the most beautiful human being that God has created,’” Chiles said on the podcast. “I definitely enjoy the fact that the younger generation has someone to look up to that’s like me.”
C.J. Nickolas, ranked second in the world in his weight class in taekwondo, is known for his devastating signature kick. He’s also known for his sportsmanship. 
Nickolas’ mother, Denise, said that after every fight, her son runs to get ice for his opponent. In one instance, after a knockout victory, he was not allowed back into the venue and asked his mother to check on his opponent.
“That’s just him,” his mother told NBC News. “So it makes you think: ‘Who even is this person when he’s in the ring?’ It really doesn’t match up to the person he is outside the ring.”
For Nickolas, this competitive spirit and characteristic kindness are part of being a role model for others, specifically Black athletes who are “in the game” watching him on the world stage.
As he eyes the gold medal at the Paris Olympics, Nickolas said the way he carries himself as an athlete is “for the culture.”
“I feel like and I hope that I’m portraying the right image so that they can believe in doing it the right way, and you’re a good person and you stand on good morals,” he said. “Then you work hard, obviously, then the right things will happen to you.”

He was 90.
A statement on Mayall’s Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. “Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world’s greatest road warriors,” the post said.
He is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.
Mayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father’s 78-rpm records.
“I’m a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band — who can be good friends of mine,” Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. “It’s definitely a family. It’s a small kind of thing really.”
A small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn’t shy about saying so.
“I’ve never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,” he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. “I’m still an underground performer.”
Known for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for “Wake Up Call” which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album “The Sun Is Shining Down.” He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.
He was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album “Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,” is considered one of the best British blues albums.
Mayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.
“Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it’s really for neither of those two things, it’s just for the love of the music,” he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. “I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.”
Mayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.
Sounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, “The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that’s where his favorite pub was.”
His father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.
Mayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time — a year on the left hand, a year on the right, “so I wouldn’t get all tangled up.”
The piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, “Blues Alone.”
Mayall was often called the “father of British blues,” but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.
The Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall’s biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds’ commercial direction.
Mayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had “the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.”
Mayall tolerated Clapton’s waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.
Clapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that “to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,”
“I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,” Clapton added.
Mayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.
Mick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.
“You’d have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,” Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. “You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.”
Mayall’s 1968 album “Blues from Laurel Canyon” signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.
The following year he released “The Turning Point,” arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. “Room to Move,” a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall’s later career.
The 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.
“Throughout the ‘70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,” Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed — shattering one of Mayall’s heels and leaving him with a limp.
“That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,” Mayall said.
In 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.

France struck first in its opening group stage match vs. USA. Then, for good measure, the hosts doubled their lead.
After dominating possession in the first 45 minutes, France finally broke through in the second. French captain Alexandre Lacazette uncorked a shot from outside the box that beat USMNT goalkeeper Patrick Schulte to the back-left corner of the net to give France a 1-0 lead in the 61st minute.
Then, from a similar spot in the 69th minute, Michael Olise — off a pass by Lacazette — scored, once again hitting the back-left corner of the goal after a slight deflection off a USMNT defender.

Israel finally broke through in the 56th minute as a wild scramble in front of the Mali net ended in an own goal by Hamidou Diallo.
Mali has been on the front foot through most of the match but Les Aigles will not have to search for the equalizer.
David K. Li
PARIS — The halftime whistle blew with no team breaking through, however Mali forced more action here at Parc des Princes. 
Les Aigles won the battle of shots on goal and corner kicks, 3-0 and 5-0 respectively, while maintaining about two-thirds of possession. But Mali couldn't beat Israeli goalkeeper Omer Niron in the first 45 minutes. 
Rohan Nadkarni
USA and France entered halftime of their first group stage match scoreless. 
France dominated much of the initial 45 minutes of action, controlling possession, attempting more shots and shooting five corners (compared to the United States’ one.)
France nearly took the lead late in the first half when a left-footed shot by Jean-Philippe Mateta just barely missed the right post. USA’s best opportunity to score came in the 38th minute, when a shot by Paxten Aaronson was saved in the middle of the net. 
The attempt came not long after a foul by USA’s Kevin Paredes drew a yellow card in the 37th minute. It was among many miscues by USA, who were also caught offside three times.
Both countries are being represented by their U23 squads in Paris. USA is playing in the Olympics for the first time since Beijing in 2008.

Japan continued its dominant form against Paraguay today, winning 5-0. Paraguay went down to 10 men in the first half, with a red card due to an improper tackle. 
Japan took advantage with two goals from Shunsuke Mito. 
Rhito Yamamato scored in the early part of the second half, while forward Shota Fujio scored two quick goals, the first in the 83rd minute, for a 4-0 lead. A few minutes later, Fujio received a through ball from the midfield, beating Paraguay's backline and goalkeeper for a 5-0 lead.

The match later resumed with only three minutes left on the clock at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard with no fans in attendance. After a VAR review, the ref disallowed Medina's equalizer for being offside. 
The final result was Morocco 2, Argentina 1.

In the second half, Guinea equalized with a goal from outside the box by Amadou Diawara in the 72nd minute. However, four minutes later, New Zealand's Ben Waine made a darting run toward the goalkeeper, tapping in what became the game-winning goal at 2-1.
New Zealand faces the United States in its next match Saturday.

This year's flag bearers for Team USA, Coco Gauff and LeBron James, will become the second duo to do so after baseball star Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird carried the flag in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The Tokyo Olympics were the first to allow one male and one female flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

Italy's Jannik Sinner, the world's No. 1 tennis player, has announced he has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics after contracting tonsillitis. 
In a post on X, Sinner said: ""I am saddened to inform you that unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the Paris Olympic Games.""
""After a good week of clay training I started to feel unwell,"" Sinner wrote. ""I spent a couple of days resting and during a visit the doctor found tonsillitis and strongly advised me against playing.""
""Missing the Games is a huge disappointment as it was one of my main goals for this season. I couldn’t wait to have the honor of representing my country in this very important event,"" he said.
Sinner's withdrawal means Novak Djokovic, for whom an Olympic gold medal is the only major prize missing from his illustrious career, will now be the No. 1 seed in Paris. He now cannot meet second seed Carlos Alcaraz, who beat him in the final of Wimbledon earlier this month, until the medal matches. 
The Australian Open champion's withdrawal is a big blow to the Paris tennis competition. With no ranking points nor prize money on the line and a looming switch to hard courts for the U.S. Open, several high-profile players, including Americans Ben Shelton, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, have opted out of competing.

The coach of the Canadian women’s soccer team, Bev Priestman, has apologized to the New Zealand team after a support member of her team used a drone to film their opponents during a training session in Saint-Etienne on Monday.
Priestman has withdrawn from coaching Canada’s opening game in Group A against New Zealand on Thursday. “In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld,"" Priestman said in a statement.
Analyst Joseph Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander have been sent home, the Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement, adding that Canada Soccer staff will also undergo what the statement called “ethics training.” 
“This does not represent the values that our team stands for,” Priestman said.
New Zealand’s Olympic Committee (NZOC) said they informed police on Monday as soon as they spotted the drone flying over the team training session. The drone operator, a support staff member of the Canadian Women’s soccer team, was later detained.  
The NZOC said in a statement that it was ""deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024.""
On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that six drones on average are being intercepted by security forces near Olympic sites every day.

In Wednesday’s Olympic curtain-raiser at the Stade de France, Team USA’s Rugby Sevens team goes up against France and its global superstar Antoine Dupont — the Simone Biles of rugby, if you will.
Dupont is widely considered the best rugby player in the world when he plays the full version of the game, which has 15 players on each team. 
It’s not the first time the two countries have faced each other in rugby in the Olympics. In fact, the U.S. is the reigning 15-a-side rugby Olympic champions.
Fifteen-a-side rugby was featured in the Olympics the last time Paris hosted the games, in 1924, with the final pitting USA — whose team was made up of California college students — against favored France. 
The final at the Stade Olympique de Colombes was so violent that the International Olympic Committee decided to discontinue the sport from the Games. 
After a U.S. victory, 17-3, in front of a hostile crowd of 50,000, the American team had to be escorted from the field by police, fearing for their lives. 
The American teams that won Olympic gold at the 1920 and 1924 games were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2012.
Men and women’s Rugby Sevens debuted at the 2016 Rio Games.

Men’s Rugby Sevens are one of the first events to get underway today at the Paris Games. Australia plays Samoa in the first game at 9:30 a.m. ET, before Team USA takes on hosts France at 10:30 a.m. ET and Tokyo gold-medalists Fiji at 2:30 p.m. ET.
The sport, which originated in Scotland, is a variant of rugby union — one of the sports in which football has its roots. The main difference is that while regular Rugby Union is played with 15-player teams over 40-minute halves, sevens has seven-player teams playing seven-minute halves.
The Olympic men's and women's sevens tournaments feature 12 teams each. The variant made its debut at the 2016 Rio Games after a 92-year-long absence of any Games rugby, after the full-size version was discontinued following the violence that occurred at the last Paris Games a hundred years ago. 
Fiji’s men's team and New Zealand’s women's team won gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Games. The tournaments are set to run from July 24-30. The men’s final, scheduled for July 27, will be the first event to award a team sport gold medal at the Games this year.

Let the Games begin!
It's 3 p.m. local time and the Paris Olympic Games are getting underway with men's soccer. In two simultaneous games, Euro 2024 winners Spain take on Uzbekistan at Paris' Parc des Princes, while 250 miles away in Saint-Étienne, Copa America champions Argentina face Morocco. 
While the men’s soccer tournament has an under-23 age requirement, Argentina is expected to field a few of its senior players who lifted the Copa America Cup earlier this month. Julián Álvarez is in the squad, as is Nicolás Otamendi. Paris Saint-Germain star Achraf Hakimi may feature for Morocco too.
Eagle-eyed readers might point out that the opening ceremony doesn't take place until Friday and ask why there's soccer happening today. Fortunately, Benjamin Ceugnart, Competitions Calendar Project Manager at Paris 2024, explains on the Games' official site. 
""Since the Barcelona 1992 Games, football has started ahead of the opening ceremony,"" he explains. ""What’s more, the players can’t play every day, so they need a recovery period of at least 48 hours.""

Coco Gauff said she couldn't hold in her emotions when telling her mom she would be the female flagbearer for Team USA during Friday's Opening Ceremony on the Seine.
Speaking with NBC News' ""TODAY,"" Gauff, who will be the first tennis player to carry the flag, revealed she found out about the honor Tuesday during a photoshoot with her tennis teammates. They were wearing their opening ceremony outfits when teammate Chris Eubanks presented her with her flag bearer jacket.
""I didn’t want to cry in front of my teammates when Chris told me. I was holding it in,"" Gauff told Craig Melvin. ""But when I called my mom, I started crying because I think it’s even more special that so many incredible people ... think that I’m worthy of this. And it means a lot, truly.""
A life-long Miami Heat fan, Gauff recalled watching fellow flag bearer LeBron James during his time. While the pair have never met, Gauff revealed she once received social media messages from the basketball icon with words of encouragement. ""This is a cool kind of circumstance to be meeting him,"" Gauff said. ""And I guess I'll actually get to know him a little bit""

American gymnastics superstar Simone Biles has been getting in some practice ahead of her first Paris Olympics event scheduled for 3:30 a.m. ET on Sunday July 28th.
Artistic gymnastics events are due to take place from July 27 to August 5. Biles, who is history's most decorated gymnast, called the coming Olympics a ""redemption tour"" after Team USA was forced to settle for silver in Tokyo. 
At the 2020 Games in Japan, the 27-year-old withdrew from the final individual all-around competition, citing mental health consideration. She won four golds at the 2016 Rio Games.

The Games are set to begin in less than an hour, with soccer games in Paris and Saint-Étienne. One of those games features Copa América winners Argentina, but fans may be disappointed by the absence of sporting legend Lionel Messi. Why no Messi?
In an interview with ESPN, Messi said that he was ""not at an age to be in everything."" Because soccer players have to contend with a crowded calendar, they have to pick and choose which tournaments they can take part in.
The Copa América and the European Championship, two of the game’s most prestigious international tournaments, ended on July 14. Domestic leagues don’t stop for the Olympics, either. The MLS regular season is ongoing and will run through October, while England’s Premier League begins its season on August 16, shortly after the Olympics.
Unlike Messi, though, most male Olympic soccer players are of an age where they can take part. The men’s competition has an under-23 age requirement, with each team allowed three exceptions to that rule. That's why we may see some more recognizable players such as Julián Álvarez and Nicolás Otamendi playing for Argentina, and Achraf Hakimi for Morocco.
The U.S. men’s national team has still sent three ""over-age"" players: Walker Zimmerman, Miles Robinson, and Djordje Mihailovic. Among the under-23 rising stars are goalkeeper Gaga Slonina and midfielder Tanner Tessmann.

Last minute preparations for the Olympics opening ceremony are taking place this morning along the Seine, where Coco Gauff and LeBron James will carry the stars and stripes Friday. 
Security is tight with police from around the world mixing with units of French soldiers. Sound systems are being tested and live broadcast camera crews are rehearsing. 
The man responsible for the Eiffel Tower will have one of the best seats in the house for a history-making Opening Ceremony. From the second floor of the world famous landmark he points out the route.
""The boats will come through the heart of Paris,"" Eiffel Tower president Jean Francois Martins says, as he looks toward Notre Dame cathedral in the distance. ""And they will go all along the River Seine, past the Louvre museum.""
""You have to imagine all the boats arriving just here,"" he says enthusiastically as he looks down at the Trocadero, ""[and] pronouncing this magical sentence: 'we declare the Olympics open.'""
Martins is allowed to be excited. He was part of the original bid for Paris 2024 and now gets to see his dream come true. ""At last it’s happening,"" he says. ""I’m feeling confident because we know all the work that has been done. Everyone has been so committed for more than 10 years.""
But now, he says he's impatient ""to see it for real."" The original Olympic bid for Paris had a signature theme titled ""made for sharing,"" he says. ""So now, it’s time to share it with all the world. Paris is getting into the Olympic mood and it is so joyful.""

Coco Gauff has spoken of her pride after being confirmed as Team USA's female flagbearer for Friday's Olympics opening ceremony. 
A big basketball fan, Gauff will carry the flag alongside hoops legend LeBron James during Friday’s procession on the Seine in Paris. The pair are at opposite ends of their sporting careers — when Gauff was born in 2004, James had already played 62 NBA games for the Cleveland Cavaliers, having been drafted a year earlier. 
""I never thought in a million years I would have the honor of carrying the American flag for Team USA in the Opening Ceremony,"" Gauff said in a Team USA statement. ""I could not be more proud to lead my teammates with LeBron as we showcase our dedication and passion on the biggest stage there is — at a moment where we can bring athletes and fans together from around the world.""
Gauff was selected in a vote of fellow Team USA athletes and was nominated for the honor by Team USA tennis teammate and close friend Chris Eubanks.
 ""I’m incredibly proud of Coco — I know how great she is as a tennis player, but more importantly, how great she is as a person,"" Eubanks said. “I don’t think there is anyone more deserving of this honor.""
United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland, meanwhile, said that ""to be nominated by your teammates for this honor speaks volumes about the way in which Coco approaches her sport and her role as a member of Team USA. I’m thrilled for her to start her Olympic journey here in Paris.""
Sean Nevin
Tennis star Coco Gauff will become Team USA’s youngest athlete ever to carry the flag at an Olympic Games opening ceremony, after being announced as the female flag bearer for Friday’s procession, NBC News first reported.
Gauff, who won her first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open last year, will join basketball legend LeBron James in carrying the stars and stripes as part of the ceremony on the Seine River.
The 20-year-old Floridian native will be making her Olympic debut in Paris. She missed the Tokyo Games in 2021 when she was 17, after testing positive for Covid days before she was due to travel to Japan.
NBC Olympics last week published a letter Gauff wrote to the heartbroken 2021 version of herself.
""I’ll spoil the story for you — you do get to finally play at your first Olympic Games in Paris,"" Gauff wrote in the letter. ""The excitement is overwhelming. You can’t wait to travel with your teammates, to take on the Olympic tennis tournament and hopefully increase the United States’ medal count that you continually check each Olympics.""
""You’ve already won, you’ve made your childhood dream of playing at the Olympics, representing the United States, a real reality. And now, finally, you get to enjoy it.""

Charlotte Dujardin, Britain’s joint-most decorated female Olympian, has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics after a video emerged showing her allegedly mistreating a horse during a coaching session. The four-year-old video depicts equestrian dressage athlete Dujardin vigorously whipping a horse.
The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) said it received a video Monday that filmed during a training session from a lawyer representing ""an undisclosed complainant."" 
In a post on Instagram, Dujardin said ""what happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however, there is no excuse."" She added: ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.""
She confirmed her withdrawal ""from all competition — including the Paris Olympics"" while the FEI investigates the video. ""I am sincerely sorry for my actions and devastated that I have let everyone down, including Team GB, fans and sponsors.""
Dujardin, a triple Olympic Gold Medalist, currently holds all three World Records in the sport of dressage. Dressage is a type of equestrian sport in which the horse and rider perform a series of predetermined movements from memory. It is often called “horse ballet” due to its precision and grace, and the harmony required between the horse and rider in the performance.

French President Emmanuel Macron and his government ministers have been relentlessly hitting the airwaves and speaking to reporters before Friday’s Olympic opening ceremony.
Their message is simple: France is ready to keep the Paris Olympics safe.
These Games will see the biggest security operation in French history, officials said, with 45,000 police officers and gendarmes on duty Friday and 35,000 working every day after during the competition. Some 18,000 military personnel have been mobilized, as well as specialist military units.
Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has said that there are no credible threats against the Paris Olympics.
France’s domestic intelligence agency, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI), will on high alert. A new intelligence analysis center created for Paris 2024 will act as a hub for information gathered by the French intelligence community and international partners.
The agency said it foiled a terrorist plot when a Chechen man was arrested in Saint-Etienne in May, suspected of planning an attack on the city’s soccer stadium during Paris 2024. The Islamic State Khorasan Province group, the Central Asian offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group, was behind the plot, officials have said.
There have been about 50 terrorist attacks stopped by intelligence services since 2017, according to the DGSI.

France dominated much of the initial 45 minutes of action, controlling possession, attempting more shots and shooting five corners (compared to the United States’ one.)
France nearly took the lead late in the first half when a left-footed shot by Jean-Philippe Mateta just barely missed the right post. USA’s best opportunity to score came in the 38th minute, when a shot by Paxten Aaronson was saved in the middle of the net. 
The attempt came not long after a foul by USA’s Kevin Paredes drew a yellow card in the 37th minute. It was among many miscues by USA, who were also caught offside three times.

Israeli soccer fans weren't hard to spot as they entered Parc des Princes ahead of their team's match against Mali.
""We are here to support Israel so it's time to to wear the flag,"" said 41-year-old Paris engineer David Gill, one of many supporters wearing an Israeli flag as a cape. ""We're in the stadium, there are police and security so I don't have to be afraid to have my flag."" 
Yuval Israeli, as 23-year-old who works for a tech startup near Tel Aviv, said he felt perfectly safe wearing his Star of David flag on the grounds knowing there's such heavy security.
Asked if he'd keep his cape on after the match on public transit, his answer had little to do with politics or war: ""Depends if we win."" Greg Hyatt

Cry for me Argentina! Cristian Medina's header goal in the 16th minute of stoppage time that brought the Latin American nation to a 2-2 tie with Morocco was too good to be true.
Moroccan fans invaded the field to protest the late goal, turning the stadium into chaos. The game was suspended for nearly two hours. 
The match later resumed with only three minutes left on the clock at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard with no fans in attendance. After a VAR review, the ref disallowed Medina's equalizer for being offside.

Eldor Shomurodov scored a penalty against Spain for Uzbekistan's first ever goal in a major soccer tournament during their opening match of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Japan's men's soccer team scored the opening goal in its first match of the 2024 Paris Olympics. 
In the 19th minute, left-back Ayumu Ohata found his teammate Shunsuke Mito in the box, who slid it past the goalkeeper.
However, just minutes later, Paraguay's Wilder Viera made contact with Japan's Yu Hirakawa's ankle. A VAR review led to Viera being sent off as Paraguay are now down to 10 men.Greg Hyatt
New Zealand won its first men's soccer game with a 2-1 result over Guinea. Although New Zealand missed its first scoring opportunity after a penalty was awarded for an improper sliding tackle, it later scored in the 25th minute courtesy of Matthew Garbett to go ahead 1-0.
In the second half, Guinea equalized with a goal from outside the box by Amadou Diawara in the 72nd minute. However, four minutes later, New Zealand's Ben Waine made a darting run toward the goalkeeper, tapping in what became the game-winning goal at 2-1.

This year's flag bearers for Team USA, Coco Gauff and LeBron James, will become the second duo to do so after baseball star Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird carried the flag in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

A man arrested in France on Tuesday and accused of plotting a terror attack may have targeted the 2024 Olympic Games, Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said. Darmanin was speaking to French news station BFMTV and did not provide any further details. 
The 18-year-old man was arrested in the Gironde region in southwest France on Tuesday, charged with preparing an act of terrorism, a source at the National Counterterrorism Prosecutor’s Office has confirmed to NBC News.
""We think it's connected to plans for a violent act against the Olympic Games,"" Darmanin said.
France’s Interior Ministry did not respond to an NBC News request for comment. Sean Nevin
Italy's Jannik Sinner, the world's No. 1 tennis player, has announced he has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics after contracting tonsillitis. 
In a post on X, Sinner said: ""I am saddened to inform you that unfortunately I will not be able to participate in the Paris Olympic Games.""
""After a good week of clay training I started to feel unwell,"" Sinner wrote. ""I spent a couple of days resting and during a visit the doctor found tonsillitis and strongly advised me against playing.""
""Missing the Games is a huge disappointment as it was one of my main goals for this season. I couldn’t wait to have the honor of representing my country in this very important event,"" he said.
Sinner's withdrawal means Novak Djokovic, for whom an Olympic gold medal is the only major prize missing from his illustrious career, will now be the No. 1 seed in Paris. He now cannot meet second seed Carlos Alcaraz, who beat him in the final of Wimbledon earlier this month, until the medal matches. 
The Australian Open champion's withdrawal is a big blow to the Paris tennis competition. With no ranking points nor prize money on the line and a looming switch to hard courts for the U.S. Open, several high-profile players, including Americans Ben Shelton, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, have opted out of competing.

In an unbelievable display of last-second heroics, Argentina's Cristian Medina clinched a goal with a header in the 16th minute of stoppage time.
It was an extraordinary play — with at least four back-to-back Argentine attempts, two bouncing off the bar, to make it past goalie Munir El Kajoui — and was met with raucous cheers from the crowd.

The coach of the Canadian women’s soccer team, Bev Priestman, has apologized to the New Zealand team after a support member of her team used a drone to film their opponents during a training session in Saint-Etienne on Monday.
Priestman has withdrawn from coaching Canada’s opening game in Group A against New Zealand on Thursday. “In the spirit of accountability, I do this with the interests of both teams in mind and to ensure everyone feels that the sportsmanship of this game is upheld,"" Priestman said in a statement.
Analyst Joseph Lombardi and assistant coach Jasmine Mander have been sent home, the Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement, adding that Canada Soccer staff will also undergo what the statement called “ethics training.” 
“This does not represent the values that our team stands for,” Priestman said.
New Zealand’s Olympic Committee (NZOC) said they informed police on Monday as soon as they spotted the drone flying over the team training session. The drone operator, a support staff member of the Canadian Women’s soccer team, was later detained.  
The NZOC said in a statement that it was ""deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024.""
On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that six drones on average are being intercepted by security forces near Olympic sites every day. 
“Maybe tourists wanting to take pictures,” Attal said.Greg Hyatt

In Wednesday’s Olympic curtain-raiser at the Stade de France, Team USA’s Rugby Sevens team goes up against France and its global superstar Antoine Dupont — the Simone Biles of rugby, if you will.
Dupont is widely considered the best rugby player in the world when he plays the full version of the game, which has 15 players on each team. 
It’s not the first time the two countries have faced each other in rugby in the Olympics. In fact, the U.S. is the reigning 15-a-side rugby Olympic champions.
Fifteen-a-side rugby was featured in the Olympics the last time Paris hosted the games, in 1924, with the final pitting USA — whose team was made up of California college students — against favored France. 
The final at the Stade Olympique de Colombes was so violent that the International Olympic Committee decided to discontinue the sport from the Games. 
After a U.S. victory, 17-3, in front of a hostile crowd of 50,000, the American team had to be escorted from the field by police, fearing for their lives. 
The American teams that won Olympic gold at the 1920 and 1924 games were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2012.

Men’s Rugby Sevens are one of the first events to get underway today at the Paris Games. Australia plays Samoa in the first game at 9:30 a.m. ET, before Team USA takes on hosts France at 10:30 a.m. ET and Tokyo gold-medalists Fiji at 2:30 p.m. ET.
The sport, which originated in Scotland, is a variant of rugby union — one of the sports in which football has its roots. The main difference is that while regular Rugby Union is played with 15-player teams over 40-minute halves, sevens has seven-player teams playing seven-minute halves.
The Olympic men's and women's sevens tournaments feature 12 teams each. The variant made its debut at the 2016 Rio Games after a 92-year-long absence of any Games rugby, after the full-size version was discontinued following the violence that occurred at the last Paris Games a hundred years ago. 
Fiji’s men's team and New Zealand’s women's team won gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Games. The tournaments are set to run from July 24-30. The men’s final, scheduled for July 27, will be the first event to award a team sport gold medal at the Games this year.David K. Li

About 15 minutes into the opening soccer match between Spain and  Uzbekistan, the stands here at Parc des Princes are about two-thirds filled.
Fans are spread throughout every corner of the stadium, so it would appear nearly all tickets are spoken for, but some are taking their time to get here.

Let the Games begin!
It's 3 p.m. local time and the Paris Olympic Games are getting underway with men's soccer. In two simultaneous games, Euro 2024 winners Spain take on Uzbekistan at Paris' Parc des Princes, while 250 miles away in Saint-Étienne, Copa America champions Argentina face Morocco. 
While the men’s soccer tournament has an under-23 age requirement, Argentina is expected to field a few of its senior players who lifted the Copa America Cup earlier this month. Julián Álvarez is in the squad, as is Nicolás Otamendi. Paris Saint-Germain star Achraf Hakimi may feature for Morocco too.
Eagle-eyed readers might point out that the opening ceremony doesn't take place until Friday and ask why there's soccer happening today. Fortunately, Benjamin Ceugnart, Competitions Calendar Project Manager at Paris 2024, explains on the Games' official site. 
""Since the Barcelona 1992 Games, football has started ahead of the opening ceremony,"" he explains. ""What’s more, the players can’t play every day, so they need a recovery period of at least 48 hours.""Sean Nevin
Coco Gauff said she couldn't hold in her emotions when telling her mom she would be the female flagbearer for Team USA during Friday's Opening Ceremony on the Seine.
Speaking with NBC News' ""TODAY,"" Gauff, who will be the first tennis player to carry the flag, revealed she found out about the honor Tuesday during a photoshoot with her tennis teammates. They were wearing their opening ceremony outfits when teammate Chris Eubanks presented her with her flag bearer jacket.
""I didn’t want to cry in front of my teammates when Chris told me. I was holding it in,"" Gauff told Craig Melvin. ""But when I called my mom, I started crying because I think it’s even more special that so many incredible people ... think that I’m worthy of this. And it means a lot, truly.""
A life-long Miami Heat fan, Gauff recalled watching fellow flag bearer LeBron James during his time. While the pair have never met, Gauff revealed she once received social media messages from the basketball icon with words of encouragement. ""This is a cool kind of circumstance to be meeting him,"" Gauff said. ""And I guess I'll actually get to know him a little bit""Will Clark

American gymnastics superstar Simone Biles has been getting in some practice ahead of her first Paris Olympics event scheduled for 3:30 a.m. ET on Sunday July 28th.
Artistic gymnastics events are due to take place from July 27 to August 5. Biles, who is history's most decorated gymnast, called the coming Olympics a ""redemption tour"" after Team USA was forced to settle for silver in Tokyo. 
At the 2020 Games in Japan, the 27-year-old withdrew from the final individual all-around competition, citing mental health consideration. She won four golds at the 2016 Rio Games.Susan Baek
The Games are set to begin in less than an hour, with soccer games in Paris and Saint-Étienne. One of those games features Copa América winners Argentina, but fans may be disappointed by the absence of sporting legend Lionel Messi. Why no Messi?
In an interview with ESPN, Messi said that he was ""not at an age to be in everything."" Because soccer players have to contend with a crowded calendar, they have to pick and choose which tournaments they can take part in.
The Copa América and the European Championship, two of the game’s most prestigious international tournaments, ended on July 14. Domestic leagues don’t stop for the Olympics, either. The MLS regular season is ongoing and will run through October, while England’s Premier League begins its season on August 16, shortly after the Olympics.
Unlike Messi, though, most male Olympic soccer players are of an age where they can take part. The men’s competition has an under-23 age requirement, with each team allowed three exceptions to that rule. That's why we may see some more recognizable players such as Julián Álvarez and Nicolás Otamendi playing for Argentina, and Achraf Hakimi for Morocco.
The U.S. men’s national team has still sent three ""over-age"" players: Walker Zimmerman, Miles Robinson, and Djordje Mihailovic. Among the under-23 rising stars are goalkeeper Gaga Slonina and midfielder Tanner Tessmann.Keir Simmons
Last minute preparations for the Olympics opening ceremony are taking place this morning along the Seine, where Coco Gauff and LeBron James will carry the stars and stripes Friday. 
Security is tight with police from around the world mixing with units of French soldiers. Sound systems are being tested and live broadcast camera crews are rehearsing. 
The man responsible for the Eiffel Tower will have one of the best seats in the house for a history-making Opening Ceremony. From the second floor of the world famous landmark he points out the route.
""The boats will come through the heart of Paris,"" Eiffel Tower president Jean Francois Martins says, as he looks toward Notre Dame cathedral in the distance. ""And they will go all along the River Seine, past the Louvre museum.""
""You have to imagine all the boats arriving just here,"" he says enthusiastically as he looks down at the Trocadero, ""[and] pronouncing this magical sentence: 'we declare the Olympics open.'""
Martins is allowed to be excited. He was part of the original bid for Paris 2024 and now gets to see his dream come true. ""At last it’s happening,"" he says. ""I’m feeling confident because we know all the work that has been done. Everyone has been so committed for more than 10 years.""
But now, he says he's impatient ""to see it for real."" The original Olympic bid for Paris had a signature theme titled ""made for sharing,"" he says. ""So now, it’s time to share it with all the world. Paris is getting into the Olympic mood and it is so joyful.""Sean Nevin
Coco Gauff has spoken of her pride after being confirmed as Team USA's female flagbearer for Friday's Olympics opening ceremony. 
A big basketball fan, Gauff will carry the flag alongside hoops legend LeBron James during Friday’s procession on the Seine in Paris. The pair are at opposite ends of their sporting careers — when Gauff was born in 2004, James had already played 62 NBA games for the Cleveland Cavaliers, having been drafted a year earlier. 
""I never thought in a million years I would have the honor of carrying the American flag for Team USA in the Opening Ceremony,"" Gauff said in a Team USA statement. ""I could not be more proud to lead my teammates with LeBron as we showcase our dedication and passion on the biggest stage there is — at a moment where we can bring athletes and fans together from around the world.""
Gauff was selected in a vote of fellow Team USA athletes and was nominated for the honor by Team USA tennis teammate and close friend Chris Eubanks.
 ""I’m incredibly proud of Coco — I know how great she is as a tennis player, but more importantly, how great she is as a person,"" Eubanks said. “I don’t think there is anyone more deserving of this honor.""
United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland, meanwhile, said that ""to be nominated by your teammates for this honor speaks volumes about the way in which Coco approaches her sport and her role as a member of Team USA. I’m thrilled for her to start her Olympic journey here in Paris.""Sean Nevin
Tennis star Coco Gauff will become Team USA’s youngest athlete ever to carry the flag at an Olympic Games opening ceremony, after being announced as the female flag bearer for Friday’s procession, NBC News first reported.
Gauff, who won her first Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open last year, will join basketball legend LeBron James in carrying the stars and stripes as part of the ceremony on the Seine River.
The 20-year-old Floridian native will be making her Olympic debut in Paris. She missed the Tokyo Games in 2021 when she was 17, after testing positive for Covid days before she was due to travel to Japan.
NBC Olympics last week published a letter Gauff wrote to the heartbroken 2021 version of herself.
""I’ll spoil the story for you — you do get to finally play at your first Olympic Games in Paris,"" Gauff wrote in the letter. ""The excitement is overwhelming. You can’t wait to travel with your teammates, to take on the Olympic tennis tournament and hopefully increase the United States’ medal count that you continually check each Olympics.""
""You’ve already won, you’ve made your childhood dream of playing at the Olympics, representing the United States, a real reality. And now, finally, you get to enjoy it.""David K. Li

Charlotte Dujardin, Britain’s joint-most decorated female Olympian, has withdrawn from the Paris Olympics after a video emerged showing her allegedly mistreating a horse during a coaching session. The four-year-old video depicts equestrian dressage athlete Dujardin vigorously whipping a horse.
The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) said it received a video Monday that filmed during a training session from a lawyer representing ""an undisclosed complainant."" 
In a post on Instagram, Dujardin said ""what happened was completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils, however, there is no excuse."" She added: ""I am deeply ashamed and should have set a better example in that moment.""
She confirmed her withdrawal ""from all competition — including the Paris Olympics"" while the FEI investigates the video. ""I am sincerely sorry for my actions and devastated that I have let everyone down, including Team GB, fans and sponsors.""
Dujardin, a triple Olympic Gold Medalist, currently holds all three World Records in the sport of dressage. Dressage is a type of equestrian sport in which the horse and rider perform a series of predetermined movements from memory. It is often called “horse ballet” due to its precision and grace, and the harmony required between the horse and rider in the performance.David K. Li

French President Emmanuel Macron and his government ministers have been relentlessly hitting the airwaves and speaking to reporters before Friday’s Olympic opening ceremony.
Their message is simple: France is ready to keep the Paris Olympics safe.
These Games will see the biggest security operation in French history, officials said, with 45,000 police officers and gendarmes on duty Friday and 35,000 working every day after during the competition. Some 18,000 military personnel have been mobilized, as well as specialist military units.
Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin has said that there are no credible threats against the Paris Olympics.
France’s domestic intelligence agency, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI), will on high alert. A new intelligence analysis center created for Paris 2024 will act as a hub for information gathered by the French intelligence community and international partners.
The agency said it foiled a terrorist plot when a Chechen man was arrested in Saint-Etienne in May, suspected of planning an attack on the city’s soccer stadium during Paris 2024. The Islamic State Khorasan Province group, the Central Asian offshoot of the Islamic State terrorist group, was behind the plot, officials have said.
There have been about 50 terrorist attacks stopped by intelligence services since 2017, according to the DGSI.David K. Li

Chuck Grassley posts video of aftermath of Trump shooter's killing,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/grassley-posts-video-aftermath-trump-shooter-killing-rcna163372,2024-07-24 13:00:19.122200,,"U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley on Tuesday posted video that showed the aftermath of the killing of Trump shooter Thomas Crooks, with law enforcement agents on a rooftop alongside his body.
Grassley on X demanded answers and accountability following the July 13 assassination attempt targeting former President Donald Trump as he spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump was shot in the ear.
Crooks was shot and killed after firing at Trump. Crooks shot and  killed one other person and wounded two others when he opened fire at the event.
The body camera video posted by Grassley, R-Iowa, shows Crooks' body on the roof of the building from where he fired. The video also showed blood by the shooter's body.
""We NEED detailed answers ASAP on security failures,"" Grassley wrote on X. ""TRANSPARENCY BRINGS ACCOUNTABILITY.""
In the video, someone in a black suit and sunglasses speaks with law enforcement officers armed with rifles and wearing body armor following the shooting and Crooks' subsequent killing.
An officer points out a rifle lying on the roof, though it is not clear whether it is Crooks'.
The officer whose body camera is recording mentions that a sniper had seen a person coming from a bike and setting a backpack down, but lost sight of him. It is not clear in the video if the officer is talking about Crooks.
Grassley wrote that the video was obtained from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit after requests from Congress. The Beaver County Sheriff's Office has an unit by that name, which is a tactical team that responds to high-risk incidents.
The Beaver County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday night.
Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress have demanded answers about how Crooks was able to open fire at a former president, and the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said it has opened three reviews surrounding the incident.
U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday. She wrote in a resignation letter that she takes “full responsibility for the security lapse.”
Secret Service spokesman ​Anthony Guglielmi referred questions about the origin of the video to Grassley's office.
“The Secret Service is committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure that never happens again,"" a Guglielmi said in a statement. ""That includes complete cooperation with Congress, the FBI and other relevant investigations.""
Crooks' motive has not been determined.
Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris, who heads the agency, told a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Tuesday that Crooks had been identified as suspicious before the shooting.
Crooks had been spotted ""milling about and he stood out to them because he never made his way to a point of ingress to the venue,"" meaning Crooks was milling about but not trying to enter, and that Crooks was later seen with a range finder.
Paris said the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, tasked with securing the building where Crooks fired from, relayed the suspicion and a photo of Crooks to the state police, which then passed along the message to the Secret Service.  
Crooks was not designated as an actual threat until seconds before he opened fire, Paris said.

NBC_57,DNA leads to arrest of suspect in 1982 murder of teen girl in California,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dna-leads-arrest-suspect-1982-murder-teen-girl-california-rcna163367,2024-07-24 12:00:19.122200,,"Police in Northern California announced the arrest of a man in the 42-year-old cold case rape and murder of a teenage girl, saying relatively new DNA technology points to the suspect.
James Unick, 62, of Willows, about 85 miles northwest of Sacramento, was booked late Monday into the Sonoma County Jail on suspicion of murder, rape, lewd acts with a minor by force, kidnapping for molestation and a special circumstance allegation of murder during a kidnapping, according to inmate records.
He was being held without bail. It wasn't clear Tuesday night whether he has legal representation. The Sonoma County Public Defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sara Ann Geer, 13, was found murdered in downtown Cloverdale, about 120 miles southwest of Willows, on May 24, 1982, according to police. She had been abducted and raped, they said.
Evidence containing DNA was collected, but technology wasn't advanced enough to use it to track down a suspect until recent years, Cloverdale police said.
""A male DNA profile was identified from the evidence and through the use of modern DNA genetic genealogy technology,"" the department said.
The popularization of consumer kits for DNA trait and heritage tracking has created huge databases for police to compare evidence to DNA. Likewise, detectives can look at databases of suspects, defendants and convicted criminals ordered to submit DNA to find close matches that may lead them to relatives.
With genealogy, investigators might not get an exact hit, but they can get close enough to establish whether a suspect may be among a group of siblings or other relatives. That can lead to surveillance and covert operations to collect discarded food, cups and eating implements from a possible suspect in their quest for an exact DNA match.
DNA genealogy was used in the arrest and conviction of ""Golden State Killer"" Joseph DeAngelo and ""Grim Sleeper"" Lonnie Franklin Jr. 
Police started considering reopening the cold case of Sara Ann in 2019, and in July 2021 they made it official as they hired a private investigation firm to help, according to a statement at the time.
Investigators hoped ""the latest technological advancement"" would shed new light on Sara Ann's death, according to the police statement.
Detectives also blamed social media rumors about her case for making the probe more difficult. ""Misleading information posted on social media ... has already threatened to jeopardize the integrity of the investigation moving forward,"" Cloverdale police said in 2021.
On Tuesday, Cloverdale Mayor Todd Lands said in a statement: ""Today, we stand united in solidarity with the Geer family as we witness the culmination of years of hard work and perseverance by our law enforcement officials. This arrest signifies not only a step towards closure but also a reiteration of our commitment to ensuring safety and justice for all in Cloverdale.”Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. "

The demonstration, which took place in the Cannon House Office Building, was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace.
U.S. Capitol Police said they warned protesters, who were chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, before the arrests began that demonstrating in the building was unlawful.
No one appeared to resist arrest. Capitol Police lightly tapped protesters on the shoulder to stand up, arrested them with white zip ties and escorted them out of the building slowly.
Stefanie Fox, the executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Netanyahu's coming address to a joint meeting of Congress was the reason for the protest.
“For nine months, we’ve watched in horror as the Israeli government has carried out a genocide, armed and funded by the US. Congress and the Biden administration have the power to end this horror today. Instead, our president is preparing to meet with Netanyahu and Congressional leadership has honored him with an invitation to address Congress,"" Fox said in a statement.
Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who was watching the protesters get arrested from the third floor, later told NBC News that the protest was ""an embarrassment.""
""You know, frankly, these folks continue to spew pro-Hamas talking points, continue to spew anti-American, anti-Israel hatred,"" Lawler said, adding that ""many of them don’t seem to recognize the irony that if they were actually in Gaza, Hamas would very likely kill them.""
Mitchell Rivard, chief of staff for Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., said in a statement that his office was forced to call Capitol Police for assistance because the protesters were “violently beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force entry into the office.”
“The U.S. Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms responded immediately to the incident and have made several arrests. Congressman Kildee is safe and his staff are all accounted for,"" Rivard added.Ava Thompson is a Capitol Hill intern for NBC News.

The sources said current plans are to hold indoor rallies, but they also said it's possible Trump will participate in smaller outdoor events or larger rallies in facilities where entrances are more fully controlled and there are not issues with high ground nearby, like stadiums.
Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung declined to comment on Trump’s security measures and referred questions to the Secret Service.
A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
News of the shift in venues comes the day the director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, announced her resignation. In her resignation letter, Cheatle said she took “full responsibility for the security lapse” in Pennsylvania.
In a phone interview with Newsmax on Tuesday night, Trump commented on her resignation by saying, ""I just heard that she is out and she, I don’t think, had much of a choice.""
He added that in recent months his campaign had been asking for more Secret Service agents at campaign events but was ""not getting them.""
Trump has referred to his safety multiple times since the shooting on July 13, which also killed a rallygoer and injured two others. During a walkthrough before his prime-time speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee last week, Trump remarked that he felt safe inside, a source familiar with the matter said.
Trump's team had planned to do an outdoor arrival and greeting with supporters ahead of his convention speech, but it was canceled after the assassination attempt, according to a source familiar with the planning.
In his Newsmax interview, Trump also talked about an indoor rally he held in Michigan over the weekend.

An ATV driver ran over the elderly man in Hancock at 5:45 p.m. following other vandalism incidents appearing to target those expressing support for former President Donald Trump or law enforcement, authorities there said.
On Monday, a 22-year-old man contacted Hancock police and said he wanted to “confess a crime involving an ATV driver within the last 24 hours,"" the Houghton County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.
The man asked someone to respond to his home in Quincy Township, the sheriff's office said, where deputies found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
The ATV, also known as an all-terrain vehicle, believed to be involved in the crash was also found, as was clothing the suspect had been described as wearing, the office said.
Authorities did not identify the 22-year-old man.
The victim struck by the ATV was in critical condition, Hancock police said.
Statements from the police department and the sheriff’s office did not identify the nature of the political sign the victim was putting up when he was struck.
But Hancock police said that there were three incidents — two involving vandalism to vehicles — believed to be connected and carried out by someone in an ATV and that they appeared to target those expressing support for Trump or law enforcement.
The sheriff's office said the victims had displayed Trump election signs or ""thin blue line"" stickers and flags.
The sheriff's office said it and the Hancock Police Department were still investigating the case.

NBC_62,Gen Z voters largely optimistic about Harris but say she needs to prove herself on the campaign trail,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/gen-z-voters-largely-optimistic-harris-say-needs-prove-campaign-trail-rcna163215,2024-07-24 09:00:19.122200,,"The rapid ascension of Kamala Harris as the leading Democratic candidate for president is being viewed by many Gen Z voters on that side of the aisle as a much-needed jolt for the party and its prospects, while their Republican counterparts say her entry into the race is unlikely to sway their vote.
“There’s been a lot more excitement around this idea that we are, you know, going to have this opportunity to elect a young woman of color as president,” said Audrey Clayton, 21. “She really has an opportunity now to rebrand herself and introduce herself to the country in a new way.""
Nabila Chowdhury, a rising senior at Harvard, said she was “shocked” by President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his re-election bid. “But I think the Democratic Party has been fractured in a way that President Biden understands that he can’t really recover from, and I think Kamala might be the person who can bridge that fracture.”
But she still has some reservations about Harris, particularly when it comes to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Chowdhury said that while she was grateful for Harris’ calls for a cease-fire, “that’s the bare minimum that we’ve been asking for.”
""I think the main issue is that we’re not seeing any change. I think we will stay uncommitted until we can build trust,” she added.
Diva Patel, 21, said she was optimistic about Harris’ chances of winning in November. “She has a level of authenticity you don’t often see from politicians,” Patel said.
Clayton, Chowdhury and Patel were among a group of Gen Z Democrats who spoke with NBC News in the battleground state of Michigan after Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris for president.
A Tufts University study found Michigan had the highest youth vote turnout in the country in 2022, and Democrats hope that if Harris, 59, is atop the ticket she'll have greater appeal to younger voters than Biden, 81.
But Gen Z voters — people born between 1997 and 2012 — aren’t uniform in their views on Harris.
Some were unhappy with how quickly Biden, Democratic lawmakers and party delegates threw their support behind Harris.
“I would love to see an open convention and get the chance to hear from a number of the Democratic candidates,” said Cooper Weissman, 18, who is undeclared.
Young Republican voters who spoke with NBC News said that if Harris is atop the ticket it won't influence their ballots this fall.
Ky Urban, 22, the president of Southern New Hampshire University College Republicans, said he agreed with Biden’s decision to leave the race — and said it helps former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.
“Biden dropping out just gave Trump and Vance the presidency,” he said.
Ruby Macias, 25, of Phoenix, said she voted for Trump in 2020 and had planned to cast a reluctant vote for Biden this time.
“He’s obviously very rapidly declining in more ways than one,"" Macias said. ""I feel like Harris has been the one making all the moves.”
Danny Yang, 18, of Philadelphia, said the potential change at the top of the ticket didn’t alter his thinking: He's still not voting for Trump.
“The top issue this cycle is definitely democracy and preserving democracy, because Trump, with all these election-denying opinions and stuff, is really going to hurt our democracy,” he said.Victoria Feng is an intern on the NBC News technology desk.

NBC_64,"Fake video of threat to Olympic Games appears to be from Russia, researchers say",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fake-video-threat-olympic-games-russia-rcna163186,2024-07-24 08:00:19.122200,,"A video spreading on X and Telegram of a man purporting to be a Hamas fighter threatening the Olympics in Paris is part of a Russian-linked disinformation campaign meant to disrupt the event, according to researchers at Microsoft.
On Telegram, Hamas official Izzat al-Risheq denied the video had come from Hamas, calling it a forgery. 
Researchers from Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center, who reviewed the video at NBC News’ request, said it appears to have come from a known Russian disinformation group, noting that details of a previous video about Ukraine match it. 
In the most recent video, a man with his face wrapped in a scarf stands against a gray wall and addresses the people of France and President Emmanuel Macron. He says in Arabic that “rivers of blood will flow through the streets of Paris” for what he said was France’s support of Israel in the war with Hamas and its welcoming Israeli athletes to the Olympic Games, holding up a severed mannequin’s head seemingly covered in red paint. 
With the opening ceremony just days away, French authorities have reassured the public that it has taken every possible security precaution, which includes deploying tens of thousands of security personnel. Microsoft had warned that Russia was looking to scare people away from the Games.
The Microsoft researchers said Tuesday that a group known as Storm-1516, a small but prolific outgrowth of Russia’s infamous Internet Research Agency troll farm, appeared to be behind the video. The video has in recent days been spread by several popular accounts known to traffic in Russian propaganda, with some also trying to claim it came from Israel.
“This operation closely aligns with tactics, techniques and procedures observed in previous Storm-1516 operations, including a previous video that similarly pretended to be Hamas,” the Microsoft group said in a statement. 
NBC News found similarities between the new video and the previous one about Ukraine, which was posted in October and had been identified by Clemson University researchers as having come from Russia’s Storm-1516.
In the October video, several men in scarves and face coverings stand against a gray wall. One of them thanks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Arabic for “a new shipment of weapons and military equipment.” The post promoted a false claim that Ukraine had provided military assistance to Hamas, disinformation that Russian propagandists have boosted on social media. 
In both videos, the man who delivers the message appears to be standing in front of the same gray wall wearing the same uniform. He also begins his speech with the same invocation to God.
Microsoft researchers said Storm-1516 campaigns are recognized by certain tactics, including creating videos in which actors allege a conspiracy and then posting those videos to relatively new online accounts with few followers. The videos are then laundered through Telegram, X and websites impersonating local news sites or as sponsored content on foreign news sites. Their goal is to reach mainstream audiences in the West. 
In June, Microsoft’s threat analysis center said in a report that one of Russia’s goals was to create fear around the threat of violence during the Paris Olympic Games “to deter spectators from attending the Games,” wrote Clint Watts, general manager of Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center. 
The fake Hamas video was initially posted Sunday on X by an account with the name “Hamas fighter,” which was started in February and has posted only a few dozen times. 
Darren Linvill, a professor and director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson, said the fake Hamas video had been laundered through Kremlin-friendly Arab and French West African news outlets on Monday, in what he called “classic Russian placement and layering strategy.” 
And early Tuesday it passed through pro-Russian accounts, first reposted by Simeon Boikov, an Australian propagandist for Russian President Vladimir Putin who is living in Sydney’s Russian Consulate and posts online under the moniker “Aussie Cossack.” It was then shared by pro-Kremlin Telegram channels, including Golos Mordora, to 169,000 subscribers, citing Arabic-language media reports. 
Two hours after it was posted by Aussie Cossack, it was shared by Pravda-En, a known Russian propaganda outlet. The link is no longer active. 
Some of those accounts claimed Israel may have been behind the video, an accusation also leveled by al-Risheq, the Hamas spokesperson. There is no evidence that the video came from Israel.
By the afternoon, the video had been posted on X nearly 4,000 times, according to PeakMetrics, a company that tracks online threats.  
Grok, Elon Musks’ artificial intelligence model on X, which has struggled in its goal to curate the news without inserting misinformation and unverified claims, summarized the post as a trending topic, wrongly attributing the video to Hamas and adding, “This threat has sparked widespread concern and calls for increased security measures to ensure the safety of the event.”
“Grok can make mistakes, verify its outputs,” a warning label attached to the trending post read. Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News. She covers misinformation, extremism and the internet."
NBC_65,Chipotle is on a hot streak with customers,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/chipotle-sales-soar-rcna163534,2024-07-25 05:00:02.609200,,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts’ expectations as it saw higher traffic at its restaurants, bucking an industry slowdown.
Shares of the company rose after the closing bell. As of Wednesday’s close, Chipotle’s stock had slid 17% this month, hurt by investor concerns about the health of the restaurant industry. In late June, the company executed a 50-for-1 stock split.
From April: Chipotle reports big profit as diners shake off price increases
The burrito chain reported second-quarter net income of $455.7 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $341.8 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Chipotle’s profits rose from the year-ago period due to price hikes that helped offset higher avocado prices and greater usage of oil to fry tortilla chips this quarter.
Excluding items, Chipotle earned 34 cents per share.
Net sales climbed 18.2% to $2.97 billion.
The company’s same-store sales rose 11.1% in the quarter, topping StreetAccount estimates of 9.2%. 
Demand for its food peaked in April, CEO Brian Niccol said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. Same-store sales settled around 6% higher in June. Executives said that July has been more difficult to understand, given the Fourth of July holiday, weather disruptions in Texas and a recent tech outage.
Traffic to its restaurants increased 8.7%, despite backlash on social media fueled by customers who said their burrito bowls are smaller. The company has denied reducing its portion sizes.
“We have focused in on those with outlier portion scores based on consumer surveys, and we are re-emphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly,” Niccol told analysts on the company’s conference call. “We have also leaned in and re-emphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants, as it is a core brand equity of Chipotle.”
Restaurant transactions grew across every income level, Niccol said. Other consumer companies, from PepsiCo to McDonald’s, have said in recent months that low-income customers are pulling back more, pressuring their sales. Chipotle, like many fast-casual chains, benefits from a customer base that tends to make higher incomes.
The chain brought back its chicken al pastor in March as a limited-time menu item. More customers have also been ordering its barbacoa, which underwent a name change earlier this year that added “braised beef” to improve customer awareness of the option.
Chipotle opened 52 new company-owned locations and one new international licensed restaurant during the quarter.
The company reiterated its full-year outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single digit percentage. Chipotle also anticipates that it will open between 285 to 315 new restaurants this year."

Some carry plantains, cassava crackers, corn flour or half a carton of eggs as they walk home.
Middle school teacher Cruz Brito is standing across the street amid the smell of fish that clings to the hot humid air of Maturin. She has about $27 in her bank account and a single can of sardines at home. She is five days away from her next paycheck and her oldest daughter needs college supplies for the following day. So, she walks away empty handed. Maybe her neighborhood convenience store will sell her a couple of things on credit.
Eleven years into her country’s complex crisis, the days of food shortages are virtually gone, but with many earning under $200 a month, getting the essentials is a constant struggle for families in rural and urban areas alike. People work second and third jobs, start little businesses, exchange services and gamble to scrape together the money, but still every decision seems to involve a calculator and a calendar.
That angst-provoking math is among the reasons why the ruling party’s hold on power looks vulnerable in Sunday’s presidential election.
Brito is praying for a new president — and, by extension, an end to the distress that has at times left her feeling hopeless.
“I have cried because I have not had to eat,” Brito said Sunday outside the market, one week before the election. “We haven’t migrated — first, because I have my mom and dad here, and second, because I believe in God and I believe that we are going to get through this. But if not, I do have to leave unfortunately with a broken heart, like all those who have emigrated.”
Venezuela’s prolonged crisis has evolved over the years. The government of President Nicolás Maduro can even point to economic growth in post-pandemic years. But wages and worker benefits have not recovered.
Each month, public employees receive the country’s minimum wage: 130 Venezuelan bolivares, or a little more based on experience, contracts and skills. That amount has not changed since March 2022, when it was equivalent to about $30. Variations in currency exchange rates have now reduced it to $3.50. Workers also earn a monthly food assistance bonus of about $40, and those who have signed up for a system of government benefits known as the Fatherland Card get an additional $90.
That’s how, with 20 years of experience as an English teacher, Brito earns $143 every month. She gets $6.50 on the 10th of the month and again on the 25th, when she also receives $40 in food assistance. On the 15th of the month, she receives the Fatherland Card’s $90, a stipend the government has dubbed Economic War Bonus, in reference to what Maduro and allies consider attacks on Venezuela’s economy by the United States.
Families across the South American country need at least $385 a month just to buy a basic basket of goods, which among several things includes 1 liter (quart) of vegetable oil; 1 kilogram (2 pounds) each of rice, sugar, potatoes, bananas and ground beef; half a kilo (1 pound) of beans; and at least 12 eggs.
So, Brito tries to earn extra money by playing casino games on a smartphone app in the evenings, doing translations, holding raffles, and selling freezies on the streets of Maturin. She gained 1,000 bolivares — the $27 on her bank account — playing roulette. Her bets range from 33 cents to 66 cents.
Brito teaches Monday through Friday, but nationwide, educators often only show up to classrooms two or three days a week because they have to scrounge for money elsewhere.
“Getting to the supermarket, grabbing a cart and shopping around, I don’t know what that is anymore,” Brito, 47, said. “I used to buy a whole chicken, now I don’t even buy half a chicken. I have had to buy three eggs because I can no longer buy a carton of eggs.”
Private sector workers fair better but not by much, earning an average of $231 a month.
Today, 80% of the population lives in poverty.
In Maturin, an oil industry hub, the signs of a once-thriving middle class are everywhere: Two-story homes sit on corner lots in disrepair with “for sale” signs; strip malls are boarded up and auto dealerships shuttered; and a mall with ample parking has marks on the walls from where store marquees once hung. The city’s long, wide roads were created for a time when virtually anyone could afford a car, and gas was effectively free.
A car, however old, is a luxury these days. Israel Gimon had to sell one of his two vehicles due to the country’s crisis. He receives about $28.50 a month between his pension — which by law is set to be equal to the monthly minimum wage — and a Fatherland Card bonus. Retirees like him do not get food assistance.
Gimon, 66, worked for more than four decades as a construction manager and expected to live comfortably off his pension. Instead, he sells ice from his garage and repairs home appliances. He also occasionally gets $30 from his daughter, who lives in the U.S.
In a good month, he earns $50 from his repair business after deducting supplies and transportation. He said he sets his prices low because he otherwise would not be hired by his neighbors and acquaintances, all of whom are in similar economic conditions. He also often makes repairs for which he accepts in-kind payments.
His earnings must cover the needs of his wife, his other daughter, and Princess of Carmen, his beloved poodle.
“There are days we don’t have food,” he said flatly. “Sometimes we buy beef organ meats because they are more economical. We may buy half a kilo of ground beef or I buy chicken trimmings that include the neck, legs, wings. I was upper middle class!”
Through his Fatherland Card, he gets access to a package of subsidized food that includes arepa flour, beans, pasta, coffee and other shelf-stable foods. The government has long been criticized for the quality of the food it distributes across the country, but Gimon said he eats it even when it is unappetizing.
The cards give people access to a variety of social programs, including subsidized gasoline, medicines and food packages. Opposition leaders and international observers have accused the government of using the cards as both carrot and stick during elections.
Before the crisis, government social benefits were wide-ranging, including scholarships for colleges in Europe and the U.S., free housing, and all-expenses-paid trips to Cuba for cataract surgeries.
Gimon desperately needed $700 in mid-July for cataract surgery in his right eye, even though public hospitals are not supposed to charge for services. He reduced the cost by $200 when his surgeon agreed to have him repair a stand-alone freezer instead of paying his fee. The rest, including $300 for the artificial lens and $200 for the surgery equipment, was covered with help from his daughter.
On Saturday, he allowed a few people to park their motorcycles while attending a nearby rally of Maduro opponents, led by opposition powerhouse María Corina Machado. He could not attend the demonstration because of his recent surgery, but he was handing out business card-size copies of the July 28 ballot, highlighting the candidate representing the main opposition coalition, former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia.
Sweating like practically everyone else at the rally, Nilda Contreras waited patiently for Machado to arrive. She sought shade from the scorching sun under an umbrella and stood on her tiptoes to try to catch a glimpse of the opposition leader’s caravan. Contreras plans to vote for Machado-endorsed González, with the main hope of seeing an increase in wages and pensions.
At 65, she thought she’d be enjoying retirement, but she has to sell cakes, ice cream and other desserts to complement the roughly $103 she receives every month. She must reach at least $200 combining all income streams to be able to afford her husband’s eye drops and the heart medication they both take.

NBC_67,CrowdStrike losses may be biggest test yet of cybersecurity insurance risk warning from Warren Buffett,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/crowdstrike-losses-may-biggest-test-yet-cybersecurity-insurance-risk-rcna163524,2024-07-25 05:00:02.609200,,"At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual investor meeting earlier this year, Warren Buffett and his top insurance executive Ajit Jain issued a headline-grabbing warning that Berkshire would exercise caution regarding cyber insurance — in fact, it advised insurance agents to only sell cyber policies if they absolutely had to do so to satisfy a client, and to expect losses.
A primary reason cited is the difficulty in assessing the scale of losses possible from a single occurrence that spreads across technology systems, with Jain giving the hypothetical example of when a primary cloud provider’s platform “comes to a standstill.”
“That aggregation potential can be huge, and not being able to have a worst-case gap on it is what scares us,” he said.
Jain’s hypothetical seemed prescient when a quality control issue from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused a worldwide IT outage that halted flights and freight, shuttered retail outlets, and caused hospitals to resort to charting on paper.
“Insurers have been worried about something like what happened with CrowdStrike since cloud adoption happened,” said Dale Gonzales, chief innovation officer at Axio, a cyber security risk analysis company.
But Gerald Glombicki, a senior director in Fitch Rating’s U.S. insurance group, believes the cyber insurance industry largely priced in the CrowdStrike meltdown correctly, and he expects it to be manageable rather than catastrophic for the cybersecurity insurance firms..
“It will have an impact because there will be losses,” said Glombicki, “but the modeling largely got it right. Mostly, we think the industry will handle it OK. There might be some issuers that mispriced policies,” he added. 
Fitch estimates that the number of insured losses will not exceed $10 billion, ending somewhere in the mid- to high-single billions and that the industry largely priced those in.
The cybersecurity insurance market did get lucky, in some respects, with the CrowdStrike meltdown. For one, there were no significant physical damages, such as explosions at power plants, dams bursting, or fires caused by overheating equipment, which are becoming a bigger cyberterrorism risk.
“Cyber events that have more of a physical consequence would be much bigger in size or scope in terms of losses,” Glombicki said.
Additionally, even though CrowdStrike is widely deployed, its market share, estimated at 17% by Fitch, is large but limited in total impact. Among the companies that did use CrowdStrike, the worst impacted seemed to be on businesses that need 24/7 availability, like hospitals and airlines, Glombicki said.
Another factor in holding down losses and distributing them unevenly across the globe is that the CrowdStrike failure impacted places like Australia and Pacific Asia in the middle of the business day, but other markets, including the U.S., were hit during the night or early morning and many businesses were able to get systems back up within hours.
Not all cyber experts are expressing as much confidence at this point. Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tuft University’s Fletcher School who has been studying the evolving market for the past several years, suspects the CrowdStrike meltdown will send shock waves through the nascent cyber insurance market.
“It’s still pretty early to assess the volume of claims that insurers are going to see due to CrowdStrike, but I sense that there will be a lot of business interruption claims across all industry sectors, just based on the impacts we’ve seen covered in the news, and that it will be a very bad situation for insurers,” Wolff said.  
Wolff says the duration of the outages will influence the claims. Some businesses were out for hours; others were still struggling days later.
She compared it to the NotPetya cyberattacks launched by Russia in 2022, which halted much of the world’s freight.
“It’s possible that since some of these outages were shorter than what we saw after NotPetya, the claims may be smaller, at least in some cases,” Wolff said. However, she points out that the CrowdStrike glitch significantly impacted businesses, which was not the case with NotPetya.
“The U.S. is far and away the region with the highest rates of cyber insurance adoption, so I am guessing that this will be a bigger event for the cyber insurance industry both in terms of how many claims are filed and how big they are,” Wolff said.
In addition to unequal impact, cyber insurance policies themselves vary widely.
“Cyber insurance policies can be dramatically different. There is no standardization; terms and conditions can differ within a company depending on who wrote the policy,” Glombicki said.
Insurers are already cognizant of the unique challenges that cybersecurity poses for them, Gonzales said. As a result, the companies try to spread losses smartly by diversifying what is covered. However, the problem with cyberspace and ensuring its security is that it is still relatively unknown. But he doesn’t think it will drag down the whole insurance market.
“The losses won’t be as bad as hurricanes last year,” Gonzales said, adding that the comparison isn’t quite apples to apples since far more entities are insured in hurricane zones than there are cyber insurance policies. 
Gonzales says the primary claims will be for business interruption, which some policies specifically exclude anyway. But he does predict the CrowdStrike incident will cause litigation.
“CrowdStrike will be sued. There will be litigation,” he said.
“Everyone exceedingly well understands fire insurance because it has been litigated to death,” Gonzales said. 
Cyber insurance, on the other hand, hasn’t yet been litigated enough to establish protocols and precedents.
“The litigation will help define business interruption and define third-party culpability. The industry could use some defining, and hopefully, litigation fixes it,” Gonzales said. “Cyber events are evolving in ways that are slightly unpredictable. It creates a very dynamic environment,” he said, but he added, “I don’t think the CrowdStrike event will drastically change how people think about insurance.”
Ironically, the Crowdstrike event could create more interest in cybersecurity and draw more customers into the market, Glombicki said. “Boards will be asking about it,” he said.Kevin Williams is a journalist based in Ohio who regularly covers real estate, business, politics, tech, and breaking news for the New York Times and Washington Post.

NBC_68,"Stock market sees worst day since 2022 as Tesla, Google-parent Alphabet sink",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stock-market-sees-worst-day-2022-tesla-google-parent-alphabet-sink-rcna163513,2024-07-25 05:00:02.609200,,"U.S. stocks had their worst day since 2022 on Wednesday amid a broad pullback in tech companies as Wall Street traders sought to reduce their exposure to firms that have made big bets on artificial intelligence.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed down 3.6%, while the broader S&P 500 index closed down 2.3% — both their worst performances in more than 18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.25%. 
The rout was led by Tesla, whose shares fell 12.3% for its worst day since 2020, and Google parent Alphabet, which fell more than 5% for its worst day since January.
Tesla reported Tuesday afternoon that its auto revenues fell 7% compared with the previous quarter, and CEO Elon Musk said in a follow-up earnings call that the company's planned robotaxi rollout would be pushed back.
Although Alphabet reported earnings Tuesday that were in line with analysts' expectations, traders appeared to seize on remarks CEO Sundar Pichai made on the company's earnings call that signaled the tech world's booming investments in artificial intelligence were not going to pay off in a short time frame. 
""I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases [for AI products], on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I’m very bullish will happen,"" Pichai said. ""But these things take time.""
Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers financial group, said Wall Street took that as a signal to sell off shares that had enjoyed the frenzied growth that tech stocks have been experiencing in recent months.
""We're seeing some nervous profit-taking in some of the stocks that have been leveraged to AI that a lot of investors have come to rely on as a consistent source of stock market gains,"" Sosnick told NBC News. 
Alphabet also reported weaker-than-expected ad revenue from YouTube, which Google has owned since 2006. 
Other major tech names having major losses Wednesday included Nvidia, the computer chip maker powering much of the AI revolution, whose shares fell more than 6% for their worst day since 2022; Facebook parent Meta was down 5%; Microsoft fell 3.5%; and Amazon lost 3%.
The major indices have been on a relatively consistent and positive run. Even after Wednesday’s dip, the S&P 500 remains up 13.8% in 2024, with the Nasdaq up 15.5% and the Dow up 5.7% in that time.
Wednesday's sell-off comes amid renewed expectations for an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve in response to a slowing economy. While traders now say the Fed's first cut of the post-pandemic period is virtually guaranteed by September, former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley wrote Wednesday that the Fed needs to strongly consider announcing a cut at its meeting next Wednesday.
""Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,"" Dudley, now an executive at UBS financial group, wrote in a column for Bloomberg News.
Sosnick said Wednesday's stock sell-off was not a total referendum on the broader state of the economy. Year to date, the S&P 500 has still had healthy gains of about 15%, while the Nasdaq is up about 18% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 6%. 
""This is much more about a little bit of vertigo in names that have climbed a lot this year,"" Sosnick said. 
But signs of a broader economic pullback continue to mount: The U.S. unemployment rate is rising, excess savings from the pandemic have been exhausted, and consumer borrowing stress is at fresh highs.
""We expect relatively weak economic growth in the second half of 2024 and early 2025,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics research group, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

NBC_69,10 migrants drown in rushing river crossing Darien Gap in Panama,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/10-migrants-drown-rushing-river-crossing-darien-gap-panama-rcna163531,2024-07-25 05:00:02.609200,,"Ten migrants drowned trying to cross a rushing river in Panama’s Darien Gap that borders Colombia, Panamanian authorities said Wednesday.
The National Border Service said in a statement that the victims were swept away by the strong current and their bodies were later seen near the Indigenous community of Carreto.
An agency official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case said on condition of anonymity that the drownings were believed to have occurred on July 16, but the area was so remote that they were only now able to release the information.
The prosecutor’s office was investigating details, including the victims’ nationalities, the official said. More than half of the migrants crossing the Darien come from Venezuela.
More than 500,000 migrants made the treacherous crossing through the jungle-clad border in a record-setting 2023. So far this year, more than 212,000 have entered Panama through the Darien.
It is the rainy season in Panama, making the numerous rivers that migrants have to cross more dangerous.
New Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino has pledged to stop migration through the Darien with assistance from the U.S. government.
Before these 10 deaths were announced, at least 29 migrants had died trying to cross the Darien, according to Panama’s border police. Last year, police recorded 84 deaths.
Drownings occur periodically in the Darien, especially during the rainy season, but authorities said this was one of the largest drowning death tolls they can remember.
In February, five Afghan migrants drowned and one disappeared just off the coast as they tried to enter Panama by boat from Colombia.
The drownings last week came just days after the Panamanian government blocked some popular routes with barbed wire in an effort to funnel migrants to one central receiving point. In other parts of the world, including the U.S. southwest border, enforcement efforts at some locations often push migrants to riskier, more remote routes.
The National Border Service statement Wednesday said that despite efforts to block some routes “transnational organized crime through local collaborators in Caribbean coastal communities insist on using unauthorized paths putting the lives of these people at serious risk.”

FOX_1,White House comms shop's credibility questioned after Biden bows out: 'Scandal',https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-comms-shops-credibility-questioned-after-biden-bows-out-scandal,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,politics,"Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why Biden's decision has prompted U.S. politics to enter 'unchartered territory' and why many critics are calling on him to step down immediately.
The White House communication team’s credibility surrounding knowledge of President Biden's political future is in the national spotlight after telling the public for weeks that Biden would not drop out of the 2024 race while simultaneously battling questions from the press about mounting concerns over his health. 
""All you can do is shake your head.  No one at the White House has any credibility when it comes to Joe Biden’s health. From Vice President Harris to the White House physician to everyone in the press office, they covered up the president’s frailties. They hid the truth. It’s a scandal,"" former George W. Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told Fox News Digital. 
Voters and social media commenters across the nation have sounded off in recent days that the communications team was ""out of the loop"" as concerns mounted surrounding Biden's health and subsequent claims that the president would exit the 2024 presidential race. 
When Biden did announce his departure from the race, only a handful of White House and campaign officials – such as Vice President Kamala Harris, chief of staff Jeff Zients and campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon – were made aware ahead of the letter, while some senior officials learned of the decision in a Zoom call, and most others through Biden's public announcement on X, media outlets reported.

The White House communications shop, which is led by press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, had for weeks shut down claims Biden would drop out, while describing Biden's health as above board and no reason for concern. 
""Absolutely not,"" Jean-Pierre declared in a press briefing on July 3 when asked if Biden had any plans to exit the 2024 race. 
Jean-Pierre's messaging had been backed up by White House spokesman Andrew Bates, who frequently issued statements to the media that Biden was in the race to win while brushing off questions about the president's health. 
""The president told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100-days agenda to help working families,"" Bates said last week in a comment to the New York Times. 
WHITE HOUSE, FAMILY OFFER CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS IF BIDEN'S HEALTH INFLUENCED DECISION TO DROP OUT
""That is not happening, period,"" Bates said Friday when asked if members of the Biden family were discussing the president’s exit plan. ""The individuals making those claims are not speaking for his family or his team – and they will be proven wrong. Keep the faith.""
Soon after the June 27 CNN debate, worried party leaders mounted a pressure campaign on Biden to exit the race, as dozens of elected Democrats commended the president for his service in the White House, but called on him to pass the torch to another candidate better suited to take on former President Trump. Media reports cited sources who described top Democrats such as former President Barack Obama, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as working in the background on efforts encouraging Biden to drop out. 
Although the media reports mounted that Democratic leaders were working to galvanize the party without Biden ahead of the DNC, the White House communications team continued brushing off the reports as hogwash.
TRUMP CALLS FOR NEXT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TO BE HELD ON FOX NEWS

Bates, for example, went on a social media campaign shooting down media reports that Biden’s exit from the race was imminent. Meanwhile, Jean-Pierre continued touting the president’s record in office on her X account, including that Biden ""will continue to defend reproductive freedom"" and that POTUS had ""been hitting the road and meeting directly with the American people"" in the days following the debate. 
Despite the full-throated denial that there were even discussions that the president should bow out, Biden ultimately stepped aside in a tweet on Sunday afternoon. 
WHAT COMES NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS AFTER BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN SUSPENSION?
""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" Biden said in his letter posted to X Sunday afternoon announcing his departure from the race. 
Media reports shortly following the announcement indicated White House staffers and members of the campaign were shocked by the news, learning of the decision via the X post and through a Zoom call on Sunday.

Biden had been self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, after a COVID-19 diagnosis last week. He returned to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday and will address the nation in more depth regarding his exit from the race on Wednesday evening from the Oval Office. 
GOP CONGRESSMAN CALLS ON HARRIS TO 'IMMEDIATELY' INVOKE 25TH AMENDMENT OVER BIDEN'S 'DECLINING HEALTH'
Following his exit from the race, social media commenters sounded off that key White House communications team staffers were ""out of the loop"" on Biden’s plans to leave the race or mocked staffers such as Bates. 
The calls for Biden to drop out of the race were born out of his poor debate performance last month against Trump, where he stumbled over his words, lost his train of thought and appeared more subdued than his typical public demeanor. The June 27 debate opened the floodgates to traditional allies and legacy media outlets to call on him to drop out, though conservatives and critics had for years said Biden’s mental fitness was concerning. 
As questions surrounding the president’s health mounted, the White House communications team juggled an onslaught of questions regarding whether the president was suffering with an illness such as Parkinson’s disease. 
The media’s interactions with Jean-Pierre and the communications team became more heated, as reporters pressed the spokeswoman for answers on the president’s health, and called into question the team’s credibility.
Jean-Pierre was pressed by the media during a fiery exchange earlier this month to speak to whether a Parkinson’s disease expert’s eight visits to the White House were related specifically to Biden’s health. Jean-Pierre, instead, refused to confirm the doctor by name. She did confirm a neurologist had examined Biden three times for his three yearly physicals since taking office.

​​""They’re in the White House visitor logs. It’s public. I looked it up before I came out here. It is right there for anyone to see,"" CBS News reporter Ed O’Keefe said during a presser early this month when questioning the press secretary about Dr. Kevin Cannard being listed eight times on White House visitor logs. 
""I cannot from here confirm any of that because we have to keep their privacy. I think they would appreciate that too,"" Jean-Pierre said. 
""The patient or the doctor?"" O’Keefe asked. 
""We have to keep their privacy,"" Jean-Pierre replied. 
TRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?'
""It is public,"" NBC News correspondent Kelly O’Donnell jumped in to say, while O’Keefe added, ""you’re going to allow this to fester longer, Karine, unless the White House just answers the question.""

Jean-Pierre was grilled yet again in another press conference about Cannard’s visits, where she erroneously said one of the meetings this year was not related to Biden’s health. 
""Can you say whether that one meeting [between Cannard and O’Connor] was related to care for the president himself?"" the Associated Press asked.
""I can say that it was not,"" Jean-Pierre responded. 
The press secretary backtracked later that day, saying Cannard’s Jan. 17 meeting at the White House was in fact related to Biden’s health, specifically to the president’s yearly physical. 
Reporters also called on the White House to allow Biden's White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, to speak to them directly about the president's health. The administration, however, argued that his written updates on Biden's health and reports on his check-ups were sufficiently transparent.

""The thorough summaries Dr. O’Connor puts online for the public are far more extensive than the presidential medical documentation released during the previous administration,"" Bates told Fox News Digital earlier this month when asked if O'Connor would speak directly to the media. ""In fact, the American people heard from Dr. O’Connor through his daily written reports on President Biden’s COVID case for over two weeks straight – a condition he had the honesty to disclose right away, unlike Trump’s physicians in office.""
O’Connor has released repeated statements and updates on the president’s health since Biden took office, including when he was diagnosed with COVID, as well as updates on Biden’s annual physicals. He has, however, not joined a press briefing to field journalists' questions. 
""Dr. O’Connor teaches at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Science, completed U.S. Army flight surgeon training, and was among the first American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq. His unique expertise is sought across the medical community, in which he is respected for his candor, attention to detail, and work ethic,"" Bates continued.

Following Biden’s exit from the race, members of the GOP are calling on Biden to resign from the White House altogether. 
 ""If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement Sunday.

Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, had also called on Biden to resign in the lead-up to his bombshell announcement.

""If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?"" Vance posted on X hours before the announcement.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten revealed on Tuesday that former President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, is the first vice presidential nominee to have a net negative favorability rating following his party's convention.
""I have gone all the way back since 1980. He is the first guy after, immediately following a convention, a VP pick, who actually had a net negative favorability rating that is underwater,"" Enten said.
He also said that the average net favorability rating for a VP nominee was plus 19 points since 2000.
""JD Vance, making history in the completely wrong way,"" Enten added.

While Vance hails from Ohio, a one-time battleground state the former president comfortably carried in the 2016 and 2020 elections, the senator's selection is expected to boost Trump among working-class Democrats, especially across the Rust Belt, who otherwise might have been supporters of President Biden, according to multiple experts who spoke with Fox News Digital as Trump was weighing his options.
Enten refuted the idea that Vance would help in the Rust Belt and Ohio, noting that Vance only obtained his home state senate seat by 6 points in 2022. In comparison, Trump claimed Ohio by 8 points in 2020 and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine handily won the state by 25 points nearly two years ago.
Vance was an early critic of Trump in 2016 when the former president was campaigning to beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
At the time, Vance had dismissed Trump as ""cultural heroin"" who was leading the disenfranchised working class into a ""very dark place.""

Vance's stance began to shift while Trump was in office, which the Ohio senator said proved many of his assumptions wrong.
""I was wrong about him,"" Vance told CNN in May. ""I didn't think he was going to be a good president. And I was very, very proud to be proven wrong. It's one of the reasons why I'm working so hard to get him elected.""
In a Monday interview with Fox News, Trump said that he and Vance had ""automatic chemistry"" and dismissed the pair's past disagreements as a misunderstanding.
""Originally, JD was probably not for me, but he didn't know me,"" Trump said in the ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" interview. ""And then when we got to know each other, he liked me maybe more than anybody liked me.""

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., claimed on Wednesday that he was not part of a ‘coordinated effort’ to get President Biden to bow out of the race during an interview on ‘The View.’
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., claimed he was not part of a ""coordinated effort"" to pressure President Biden to drop out of the race despite being one of the first to publicly ask him to withdraw.
""I can't speak to the private efforts that either Speaker Pelosi or Chuck Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries were undertaking, because I really wasn’t part of those internal discussions, so I don’t know what they were conveying to the president except that they were conveying the feedback they got from members of the House and Senate,"" Schiff told the co-hosts of ABC's ""The View"" on Wednesday.
He continued, ""I can only speak for myself. I wasn’t part of a coordinated effort."" 
Schiff was one of the first prominent Democrats to publicly call on Biden to drop out of the race in the weeks following the president's disastrous debate performance.

""I really resisted wanting to say what I ultimately felt I needed to, but having worked on the January 6th committee, having worked on impeachment of the former president, having the grave concerns that I have that if we go back to the disastrous presidency of Donald Trump, it could be the end of our democracy as we know it,"" the California congressman and U.S. Senate candidate told the daytime hosts. 
""I felt compelled to speak out, but I can tell you only for myself, it wasn’t part of a coordinated effort but rather a reluctant decision to say what I think many Americans were thinking and that is, we really need someone who can prosecute the case vigorously against Donald Trump, to protect our country from the likes of Donald Trump,"" he added. 
Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asked Schiff if the White House had work to do in restoring the public trust surrounding its messaging on Biden's health. 
""I think we had confidence in the president’s ability to do the job. He’s been an incredible president. He’s done more in one term than most presidents ever accomplish. I think the questions that were raised after the debate, because of the debate, were whether he could win the job for another term,"" Schiff said.

He also said Biden reflected on the possibility of losing to former President Trump and ultimately came to the right decision. 
""I think it was the right decision, but, look, I’m sure it was enormously difficult for him. It was enormously difficult for me and for many in the party, because we have not only such respect for him, but, affection and admiration, but it was the right decision, and I think we’ve seen already how people have responded to that decision, not with derision, not with saying it should have been done before, but rather what an extraordinary act of statesmanship,"" Schiff added.

We are open to discussion on the exact date, format and location — with or without an audience,"" Wallace and Loker continued. ""Again, we believe Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, the faces of our political coverage, are the best choices to moderate."" 
TRUMP SAYS HE 'WOULD BE WILLING TO DO MORE THAN ONE DEBATE' WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
FOX News Media sent formal letters to the Trump and Harris campaigns on Wednesday proposing a debate to take place on Sept. 17 in Pennsylvania with Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier as moderators. 
The proposal continued: ""As you recall, despite not having a Democratic debate in 2016/2020, Fox News was able to secure town halls with Democratic candidates such as: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand.""
Wallace and Loker then detailed some viewership statistics, including Fox News Channel’s ""strength with key demographics such as independent voters in swing states.""
""In recognition of FOX News Media’s capabilities and reputation, we cordially extend an invitation to all concerned parties to discuss our proposal. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to the opportunity to foster informed political dialogue at this pivotal moment for our nation,"" Wallace and Loker wrote. 
The Harris and Trump campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  
Trump debated President Biden last month on CNN, promoting calls for Biden to step aside after his frail, halting performance. After weeks of pressure from Democratic allies over concerns about his ability to beat Trump again, Biden officially dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on Sunday.

Biden endorsed Harris for president shortly following his announcement.
Trump has said he’s open to debating Harris more than once as the two face off in the 2024 presidential election.
""Absolutely. I'd want to. I think it's important,"" Trump said Tuesday when asked by Fox News' Bill Melugin if he would commit to debating Harris at least once.
""I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually,"" Trump said.
Minutes later, he noted, ""I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden.""

CNN moderated the first presidential debate in June, and ABC News was scheduled to host the next Biden-Trump showdown in September. Trump previously called for the next debate to be on Fox News Channel now that Harris is expected to be atop the Democratic ticket. 
Harris on Monday night announced that she'd locked up the nomination by landing commitments from a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates to next month's Democratic National Convention, which kicks off Aug. 19 in Chicago. 
Trump and his campaign previously accepted two Fox News debates this election cycle, including a presidential debate for Oct. 2, and a vice presidential debate for a date that had not yet been determined.

Kamala Harris wants America to know she is speaking, and we all might be seeing that message on T-shirts, buttons and signs sooner rather than later.
I drove from West Virginia to Wisconsin and back last week, coursing through 9 states, some blue, some red, some swing. In my 24 hours of driving, I saw Trump signs all over the place, but not a single Biden-Harris sign or bumper sticker. Not one.
In many cases, what I saw weren’t just yard signs, but giant ""Trump 2024"" or ""MAGA,"" flags, even huge, Clark Griswold-style front lawn displays to leave no doubt about the intensity of the residents' support for Donald Trump.
BIDEN DISMISSES REPORTER SEEING ‘A LOT OF TRUMP SIGNS’ IN PA: 'YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE WRONG PLACE, PAL'
This is an old and treasured way of reading political tea leaves. It is also deeply unscientific, but in this case the gap in visible support is so overwhelming that it stands out and now suddenly leads us to wonder if Kamala Harris can begin to close it.
Now, to be fair, there has never been a politician who moves merchandise like Donald Trump. In towns across America, there are Trump pop-up stores on the side of the road. I've talked to a lot of the people who run them, including one recently in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

Many of these entrepreneurs originally followed Trump rallies in 2016 and 2020 much the way merch peddlers used to follow the Grateful Dead.
""Now I can do it just about anywhere,"" the seller in West Virginia told me.
TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS IT'S 'WELL-POSITIONED TO PROSECUTE THE CASE' AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS
It speaks to the very personal connection that many Trump supporters feel towards the man himself, something that even Americans who think Biden has been a good president just don’t display towards Joe. Could it be different with Kamala?
In my 24 hours of driving last week, I saw Trump signs all over the place, but not a single Biden-Harris sign or bumper sticker. Not one. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) 
To get a sense, I did some snooping around Amazon. In just the last three days since her announcement, there are several Harris 2024 shirts that have sold over 1,000 units in the past month. The most popular Biden-Harris shirt maxed out at 300 for the whole month.
There are dozens of Trump shirts for any occasion on Amazon that run circles around these sales, but even a modest uptick in people who want to rep the Democratic nominee in their fit seems like a good thing for Harris and something her camp will want to grow.
The last Democrat to have an impressive merchandise footprint was Barack Obama. Trust me, I lived in Brooklyn during his presidency and the Shepard Fairey ""Hope"" poster almost seemed mandatory, or like it just came pre-hung in every apartment.
TRUMP EARLY STRATEGY TARGETS STATE THAT HASN'T GONE RED SINCE NIXON
And a slogan is emerging for Harris, as well. Many of the top-selling signs, posters and wearables feature the phrase, ""I’m Speaking,"" a reference to Kamala clapping back at old, White man Mike Pence in the 2020 vice presidential debate.
This is starting to look like the beating heart of Kamala’s campaign, the strong Black woman speaking truth to the power of Donald Trump and alleged white supremacy. It's blatant nonsense, but it looks a lot better on a T-shirt than ""Not a joke,"" or ""I mean it, Jack!""
And ultimately, this is exactly why Democrats wanted this change. They needed a new story to tell, and now they have their favorite story full of racism and sexism and white privilege. Oh my.
For many conservatives, this message seems to be, ""Shut up, a Black woman is speaking!"" and comes off as insufferable. But they'd better get used to it, because Democrats will try to make it as ubiquitous as the red MAGA baseball cap. Or at least as close as they can.

We can only pray that things remain civil as now both sides prepare to wear their political passions quite literally on their sleeves.
And that brings me to the most powerful sign I saw on my journey to and fro halfway across the continent. Just outside Butler, Pa., I observed an electronic billboard on the highway with the image of Corey Comparatore, who was killed while attending a political rally.

It reads in part, ""In loving memory, of a special man who gave everything for his family, beliefs and country!""
That is a sign I wish every American could drive past, one without snark or cynicism, a simple reminder that the nation remains in the people’s hands, and that no matter who wins, what really matters is that we live together with respect and in peace.

""I love Sen. Kamala Harris for so many reasons,"" a clip of Brown says in the introduction to the new ad released Wednesday from Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno. 
""Sherrod Brown has found a new friend,"" the ad’s narrator states. ""And just like his old friend, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris doesn’t care about the border crisis.""

""As ‘border czar,’ Harris has overseen the worst border invasion in history, and Brown helped her implement the most liberal agenda in American history. In November, Ohioans will reject Harris and retire Brown.""

""Bernie Moreno and his special interest allies are attacking Sherrod because they know he will always do what’s right for Ohio while Moreno only looks out for himself.""
The race between Moreno and Brown is expected to be a close one as Republicans view it as one of their strongest opportunities to take back control of the Senate in November in a state that Trump won by 8 points in 2020.

FIRST ON FOX: As hundreds of protesters flood Washington D.C. objecting to the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one Republican lawmaker is pushing back with a bill that would bar student loan forgiveness for those convicted of hate crimes during anti-Israel student protests.
Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., is introducing the ""Prohibiting Student Loan Forgiveness for Antisemites Act."" That bill would block students who are convicted of hate crimes under state or federal law from being eligible for loan forgiveness. 
While the bill is not solely restricted to antisemitism, there has been a wave of protests in the last year targeting Israel since the Oct. 2023 terror attack on Israel by Hamas. President Biden has repeatedly attempted to cancel student loans for tens of millions of students, but this bill would make sure that doesn't apply to those convicted of antisemitism.

Dozens of anti-Israel protests broke out at colleges across America, with a variety of elite institutions being overwhelmed with antisemitic behavior. Protesters at Columbia University and other schools have chanted, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" a slogan condemned by critics as antisemitic that's also used by Hamas. The phrase is widely interpreted as calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and removal of the Jewish people, although its proponents often deny that meaning.
""We must not allow antisemites to benefit from their hate,"" Gimenez said in a statement. ""With this bill, we ensure that those that are convicted of a state or federal hate crime will not receive loan forgiveness benefits. Hate has no place in our nation, therefore we must and will continue to stand with the U.S. and international Jewish community.""

The bill comes ahead of Netanyahu’s speech before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, which has led to a number of protests. The Capitol Police said about 200 people were arrested Tuesday on charges stemming from a sit-in protest at the Cannon House Office Building. 
Others protested outside Netanyahu’s hotel, focusing much of their anger on U.S. support of Israel in its fight against Hamas. The U.S. has supported Israel in its fight against Hamas despite some splintering support for the effort, particularly among Democrats. As part of a $95 billion foreign aid package in April, the U.S. passed about $15 billion in military aid for Israel. 
KAMALA HARRIS TO SKIP NETANYAHU'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, WHILE TOP DEM SENATOR BOYCOTTS ALTOGETHER
Prior to his departure for the U.S. Monday, Netanyahu said, ""I'm leaving this morning on a very important trip to the United States at a time when Israel is fighting on seven fronts and when there's great political uncertainty in Washington.
""I will address, for the fourth time, both houses of Congress as prime minister of Israel. I will seek to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important to Israel and will tell my friends on both sides of the aisle that regardless who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains America's indispensable and strong ally in the Middle East.""

EXCLUSIVE: President Biden's son Hunter was spotted arriving at the Reagan National Airport right outside Washington, D.C. on Tuesday night where he briefly answered questions about his father's health.
""Great,"" the president's son said when asked to comment on his health just days after bowing out of the presidential race amid concerns from members of his own party about his ability to serve out another term.

Hunter's arrival in the nation's capital from Santa Monica around 9 p.m. on Tuesday comes after Fox News Digital reported he was out and about in Los Angeles last week while his father remained hunkered down on the other side of the country, battling to save his legacy and fending off reports that he would soon step down.
Hunter Biden started sitting in on meetings between his father and close staff at the White House just a week after the debate, with one White House source telling NBC at the time that the sudden presence caused confusion and prompted many to ask, ""What the hell is happening?"" 
Biden appeared to rely on his son, who was dubbed his dad's ""gatekeeper"" not only in those meetings, but on phone calls as well, sources had reported.

FOX_9,Harris’ mixed record on Israel enters spotlight during Netanyahu visit,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-mixed-record-israel-enters-spotlight-during-netanyahu-visit,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,politics,"Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats ‘snubbing’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address.
Vice President Kamala Harris has expressed mixed views on Israel over the last several years, an issue that is sure to be highlighted as she takes over at the top of the Democratic ticket at the same time as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington.
Harris has often been an advocate for Jewish causes and frequently supported the U.S. alliance with Israel since joining the Senate in 2017, but cracks in the now-vice president’s support for the Jewish state have started to show amid the country’s monthslong invasion of neighboring Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks.
Shortly after taking office in 2017, Harris and husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, traveled to Israel. The trip was the third for Harris, according to a report from the Times of Israel, but the first for her husband, highlighting the importance of the country to a senator who had spent much of her upbringing around the Jewish community.
That same year, Harris made one of her first speeches as a senator to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the report notes, where the freshman senator boasted that she had introduced a resolution condemning the United Nations Security Council's resolution that condemned Israel.

""I believe that a resolution to this conflict cannot be imposed. It must be agreed upon by the parties themselves. Peace can only come through a reconciliation of differences and that can only happen at the negotiating table,"" Harris said during the speech. ""I believe that when any organization delegitimizes Israel, we must stand up and speak out for Israel to be treated equally.""
Harris’ friendly relationship with Israel and the Jewish community continued after the election of President Biden, with the vice president encouraging her husband to be the first to install mezuzahs, which are inscribed with verses from the Torah, at the vice presidential residence.
Emhoff has since gone on to chair the Biden administration’s task force to combat antisemitism, a cause those close to Harris say the vice president has been deeply involved in.
However, supporters of Israel worry that the now-Democratic nominee’s support for the Jewish state has started to wane, arguing that Harris has seemingly distanced herself slightly from Biden since the conflict in Gaza began.
In March, Harris became the first administration official to call for an ""immediate ceasefire"" in the conflict. Later that month, during an interview with ABC News, Harris became the first administration official to warn that there could be ""consequences"" if the country went ahead with a planned invasion of Rafah.
""We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,"" she told the outlet.
FAMILIES OF US CITIZENS HELD BY HAMAS PIN HOPES ON NETANYAHU'S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS
That interview also highlighted a potentially fraying relationship between Harris and Netanyahu, with the vice president dodging questions about whether the Israeli prime minister was an ""obstacle to peace.""
""I believe that we have got to continue to enforce what we know to be and should be the priorities in terms of what is happening in Gaza,"" Harris said in response. ""We've been very clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. We have been very clear that Israel and the Israeli people and Palestinians are entitled to an equal amount of security and dignity.""

The ABC News interview came after the vice president raised eyebrows earlier in the month for meeting with Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s wartime cabinet and a longtime rival of Netanyahu. According to a White House readout of the meeting, Harris ""expressed her deep concern about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.""
According to a report from The Associated Press, Gantz made the trip despite objections from Netanyahu.
Harris has also seemingly showed sympathy for the anti-Israel student protests that broke out across the country earlier this year, despite many Jewish students complaining that the demonstrations were antisemitic.
""They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,"" Harris said in an interview with The Nation earlier this month. ""There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don’t mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.""
REPUBLICANS SLAM HARRIS FOR OPTING OUT OF NETANYAHU ADDRESS IN FAVOR OF SORORITY SPEECH: 'SHAMEFUL'
Critics have taken note of the subtle shift, arguing that Harris has staked out a stance less supportive of Israel than Biden.
""Biden made many mistakes regarding Israel, but he is miles ahead of Harris in terms of support for Israel,"" former Trump administration Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said during an interview with the Jerusalem Post. ""She is on the fringe of the progressive wing of the party, which sympathizes more with the Palestinian cause.""
The evolution of Harris’ position on Israel comes amid a backdrop of Netanyahu’s visit and the vice president’s sudden ascent to the Democratic nominee for president. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Harris would not preside over Netanyahu’s joint address to Congress on Wednesday, instead opting to honor a longstanding commitment to attend the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Grand Boule in Indianapolis.

The vice president would typically reside over a joint address, but Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin has been tapped to fill the role in the absence of Harris.
An aide to Harris stressed that the vice president’s decision not to preside over the address should not be taken as a change of her stance on Israel, according to a Fox News Digital report Tuesday, with the aide noting that the vice president plans to meet with Netanyahu at the White House this week in a separate meeting from Biden’s.
HARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH
The aide added Harris is expected to reiterate her stance that Israel has a right to defend itself and once again condemn the Oct. 7, 2023 attack against Israeli civilians, but will also stress the need for Israel to help improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Nevertheless, Harris’ decision to skip the event elicited immediate backlash, with one Israeli official telling the Telegraph that the vice president is ""unable to distinguish between good and evil"" and that declining to preside over the address is ""not a way to treat an ally.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video message on Wednesday, slamming the ongoing anti-Israel protests at American college campuses. (Office of Israels Prime Minister)
The decision was also condemned by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, according to a report in the New York Post, who accused the vice president of abandoning an American ally.
""It is outrageous to me and inexcusable that Kamala Harris is boycotting Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech,"" Johnson, who will preside over the address with Cardin, said. ""The idea that Democrats are making political calculations when our ally is in such dire straits, fighting for its very survival… is unconscionable to us.""

However, the change at the top of the Democratic ticket does not concern the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar. 
""The Trump team has been wholly prepared for every scenario, as evidenced by the memos and gameplanning done months in advance,"" a Trump campaign adviser told Fox News Digital. ""The campaign leaves nothing to chance and is well-positioned to prosecute the case against a weak, failed, incompetent, and dangerously liberal in Kamala Harris."" 
TRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?'
The former president will continue his packed schedule of criss-crossing the nation for rallies with supporters, speeches and more. Trump also, in recent weeks, has been meeting and speaking with world leaders. 
Trump is expected to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago on Friday after speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. 
However, campaign officials said Trump's schedule, campaign plans and engagements with world leaders would be happening regardless of who is at the top of the Democratic ticket, and that Harris entering the race has not changed anything for their strategy. 
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has put out several memos since Harris got into the race, outlining how they plan to approach the new state of play. 
Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio put out a memo on Tuesday titled ""The Harris Honeymoon."" 
""The honeymoon will be a manifestation of the wall-to-wall coverage Harris receives from the MSM. The coverage will be largely positive and will certainly energize Democrats and some other parts of their coalition at least in the short term,"" he wrote. 
Fabrizio warned that because of this ""honeymoon,"" public polling could begin to show Harris ""gaining or even leading President Trump,"" but he maintained that the campaign should not worry in the long term.  
""The Democrats and the MSM will try and tout these polls as proof that the race has changed. But the fundamentals of the race stay the same,"" he wrote. ""The Democrats deposing one Nominee for another does NOT change voters' discontent over the economy, inflation, crime, the open border, housing costs, not to mention concern over two foreign wars."" 
WHAT'S NEXT FOR HARRIS NOW THAT SHE'S SEEMINGLY LOCKED UP THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION?
Fabrizio said ""before long, Harris’ ‘honeymoon’ will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden’s partner and co-pilot."" 
""As importantly, voters will also learn about Harris’ dangerously liberal record before becoming Biden’s partner in creating historic inflation (she cast the deciding vote on the IRA), flood of illegal immigrants at our southern border (she is Biden’s Border Czar), and migrant crime that is threatening our families and communities (she set illegals free who went on to commit violent crime as DA),"" he continued.  
""So, while the public polls may change in the short run, and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she's done,"" Fabrizio added. ""Stay tuned.""

""Just as Donald Trump fired Joe Biden, he will demonstrate to the world he can fire Dangerously liberal Kamala as well,"" they wrote. ""It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to defeat not just one Democrat nominee for president, but two — in the same year!"" 
The campaign cites recent polling, showing Trump leading Harris in a head-to-head match-up in national polling and in battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin. 
""This ‘War on Democracy’ — will be stopped by the man who took a bullet for Democracy,"" they wrote. 
Trump survived an assassination attempt earlier this month after Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks’ bullet hit Trump in his upper right ear, less than a quarter of an inch from his head.

Trump, less than 48 hours later, arrived in Milwaukee for the GOP convention and announced Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. 
Trump, days later, accepted the GOP nomination and pleaded for national unity.

""I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,"" Trump emphasized as he addressed the thousands of delegates, party officials, activists packed into Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum and to the national audience of Americans watching the convention from home.
""The discord and division in our society must be healed. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,"" Trump noted.
Meanwhile, just as the campaign touted Trump’s debate performance against Biden, the former president and GOP nominee told reporters Tuesday that he ""absolutely"" wants to debate Harris.

However, Trump added, ""I haven’t agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden.""

FOX_11,Top Jewish Republican group criticizes Harris for 'snubbing' Israeli leader Netanyahu's speech to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-jewish-republican-group-criticizes-harris-snubbing-israeli-leader-netanyahus-speech-congress,2024-07-25 00:00:19.122200,politics,"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. discusses how Vice President Kamala Harris is not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress on ‘Hannity.’
EXCLUSIVE: A top grassroots group that represents Jewish Republicans is taking aim at Vice President Kamala Harris for being absent from Wednesday's speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of a joint meeting of Congress.
The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), in an announcement shared first with Fox News, is launching a five-figure digital ad buy in key general election swing states that accuses the vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for ""snubbing"" the Israeli leader's address to Congress.
The speaker of the House and the vice president, in the constitutional role as president of the Senate, usually preside over joint meetings and sessions of Congress.
However, Harris will be notably absent while Netanyahu is addressing Congress. The vice president will instead be attending a previously scheduled luncheon with the Zeta Phi Beta sorority.

The vice president and President Biden will meet with Netanyahu separately on Thursday.
Harris, who is now the Democratic Party's 2024 presumptive nominee after Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president on Sunday, is seen as slightly more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than her boss amid the nearly 10-month-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
Additionally, while Haris is the most high-profile Democrat not to attend Nentayahu's speech, she is far from alone. Many Democrats in Congress, including some top figures including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will also skip the address, as they protest the Israeli leader's prosecution of the war in Gaza.

""Instead of supporting America’s strongest ally by attending Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, Kamala Harris decides to go a sorority luncheon,"" the narrator in the RJC's ad says. ""A sorority luncheon. She can’t be serious.""
""Kamala Harris: Her priorities are not our priorities,"" the narrator concludes. 
TOP JEWISH GOP GROUP MAKES BIG MOVE TO BACK TRUMP
RJC CEO Matt Brooks told Fox News that the ads will run ""in key battleground states, targeting Jewish voters utilizing the best data operation in politics.""
Brooks argued that ""Vice President Kamala Harris, as President of the US Senate, should be in attendance to preside over the chamber. Harris has totally failed her first test as a candidate for President of the United States - and the RJC will hold her accountable.""
Harris is not the only member of a national ticket in the 2024 election who will be missing Netanyahu's speech.

Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee, will also be absent. Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said that the former president's running mate had ""duties to fulfill"" on the campaign trail.
The RJC remained neutral in the GOP presidential nomination race. However, after Trump clinched the nomination, the RJC in May announced that it was committed to raising a minimum of $5 million — from its donors and from its RJC Victory Fund super PAC — to help elect Trump.
RJC national political director Sam Markstein highlighted at the time that this ""will be the RJC's largest effort ever to mobilize support in the Jewish community for President Trump.""

MILWAUKEE – Vice President Kamala Harris energized a crowd of eager voters in one major battleground state rooting for her November success, just a week after former President Trump accepted the Republican Party's nomination in the same city and two days after President Biden withdrew his Democratic nomination amid internal party pressure.
While the president's abrupt move via a post on X to suspend his re-election campaign took Democratic voters by surprise, they told Fox News Digital they are ""excited"" that Harris is slated to secure the nomination next month at the DNC and believe she's the best candidate to beat Trump in November. 
""Well, I'm excited now,"" Amy Turkoski, a spokesperson for the teacher's union, Madison Teachers Inc., told Fox News Digital at the Milwaukee rally. ""On Sunday, I was just shocked and confused, and yesterday, I still felt shocked and confused. But today, I feel united and energized and really excited that she's the candidate for us.""

And Democratic voters are hoping to win over independents as well, a group where Trump currently leads, according to a recent poll.
""We definitely need someone who will unite the independents and even unite within the Democratic Party, and I do feel she is that candidate,"" Turkoski said. ""She has the experience. She has the knowledge to unite.""
Trump and Harris are in a tight contest, the most recent national poll since Biden ended his campaign indicates. However, independents – who are being closely watched this election cycle – backed Trump 46%-32% over Harris, with one in five undecided.
In a multi-candidate field, the poll indicated Harris and Trump deadlocked at 42% support, with Democrat turned independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at 7% and Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West each at 1%.

""I'm extremely excited about Kamala Harris,"" rallygoer Lester Pines, an attorney, told Fox News Digital. ""She is articulate. She is incredibly smart. And she is the most telegenic Democratic candidate we've had in decades. You put her on television next to Donald Trump, and Donald Trump will look like the old man that he is, look like the kind of befuddled person he is.""
Pines said he thinks Biden did the right thing by suspending his campaign, ""because physically, especially once he had COVID, it was clear that it was going to be impossible for him to keep up the rigors of a campaign.""
Ben Wickler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democrat Party, told Fox News Digital he's ""fired up"" about Harris as well, despite Biden's campaign suspension being a ""tough moment.""

""This is a phenomenal moment in American politics. And I have enormous confidence that we're going to win the election this November.""
Wickler said, as the Democrats coalesced behind Harris, there was an ""energy being unlocked."" 
""And it feels like today we're in a new day, the presidential race has been reset,"" he said.
Belinda Lucas, another attendee, said she's ""very happy"" with Harris and that ""she knows Joe's agenda.""

Democratic strategist James Carville warned members of his party to be ""careful"" in their support for Vice President Harris, and said there was ""tough sledding ahead.""
""This has been a real change in mood in the party and around the country, but we got to be a little careful. There's about ten percent too much triumphalism going on, and you know, it’s going to be a very difficult race,"" Carville said during a Wednesday interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""
""It’s going to be very close, and I understand that people are feeling a lot better, and they're excited. But that excitement has got to be tempered with realism, and the realism is she has a tough campaign on, and as you say, she’s got several things she’s got to accomplish at the same time,"" he cautioned.
Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, received widespread support from members of her party after President Biden announced he would drop out of the race.

""They’re having to put a campaign together right away. They were obviously thinking about this ahead of time, but they got to accomplish, between now and the convention, they got to accomplish what most campaigns have eight months to do,"" Carville continued. 
He warned that former President Trump had a lot of support behind him. 
""We also got a locked-in and entrenched opponent who’s got a large part of the country behind him who are going to pull out — and they don’t care what’s true or what’s fair or anything else — and you got to be ready for that at every point. And all I’m saying to Democrats is, enjoy yourself, feel good, but it’s tough sledding ahead, and let’s get together and get this thing done,"" Carville said. 
MSNBC's John Heilman asked about some of Harris' weaknesses, including her work on the border crisis and questions surrounding Biden's health and ability to serve. 
Carville said Harris would have to ""defend"" and ""discuss"" the questions about a possible cover-up of Biden's health issues.

He suggested Harris point out that Republicans ""walked away"" from the border bill in Congress. Carville also said Harris was ""never"" the border czar.
""The second thing that she can point to, rather legitimately, is border crossings are down. Are we going to win that issue? No, we are not going to win it, but we can do a lot better. And the issue, I think to some extent, will run out of steam if she gives effective, cogent answers,"" he said.
Brzezinski argued that Harris should blame the issues at the border on the Republicans as well. 
""They had a deal. Team Biden/Harris gave the Republicans the best deal they could have gotten. They had it,"" she said. ""They killed it for Donald Trump. So she can put that right back on them.

Fox Nation host Piers Morgan urged President Biden to resign the presidency during his upcoming Oval Office address, arguing it's a ""bafflement"" that he remains in office after exiting the 2024 race. 
The ""Piers Morgan Uncensored"" host discussed why he thinks Biden should step down during ""Fox & Friends,"" explaining the decision would be in the best interest for the American people as concerns about his cognitive abilities loom.
JOE BIDEN RETURNING TO WHITE HOUSE FOR FIRST TIME SINCE ENDING PRESIDENTIAL BID, COVID DIAGNOSIS
""Who's running the country? Who's commander-in-chief? Who's got their finger on the nuclear button? Personally, and not to be disrespectful, given the state of Joe Biden right now, I wouldn't trust him to open my bag of chips, let alone press a nuclear button if that had to happen,"" Morgan told Ainsley Earhardt on Wednesday. 
""So I think there's a kind of bafflement that Joe Biden has not actually resigned the presidency.""
Biden is expected to deliver remarks from the Oval Office on Wednesday night addressing his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election and how he plans to finish his term. 
He said it was in the ""best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,"" when he announced the decision to end his campaign in a letter he posted on X on Sunday. 
""The right thing, if he really believes, as he says, in America, and what's good for the country and everything else, then he would resign the presidency,"" Morgan said. ""It is completely farcical that he's continuing to stumble on as the leader of the free world, the commander-in-chief of the United States. Nobody thinks he's that person.""
""Everybody thinks that he's quit because he's simply not cognitively up to the job anymore. He knows that. So I don't think he's going to do what I suggest, but I think it would be the right thing to do,"" he continued. 
Morgan argued Biden's refusal to resign after ending his presidential campaign has political implications for America's adversaries, arguing the U.S. looks ""weak"" on the world stage as a result.

""I think they're probably thinking, what a moment for America. Look how weak it all looks,"" Morgan said. ""You've got this guy stumbling on as president. And I think it's going to be very bad for him and for Kamala Harris, because she's going to be out there trying to present herself as the vision for the future for the Democrat Party.""
""But at the same time, every time Joe Biden makes any kind of speech and makes another one of his big gaffes or mistakes, or he falls over, whatever, he remains the president of United States and the leader of the Democrat Party. So I think on every level, none of this really works,"" he continued. 
The president was seen in public for the first time in six days on Tuesday at Dover Air Force Base as he returned to the nation's capital from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
He answered one question from reporters, saying he is ""feeling well"" after testing negative for COVID-19.
Biden had not appeared publicly since last week. His only public remarks on his stunning decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election came Monday during a brief phone call into the campaign headquarters of Vice Presidential Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. 
Amid the fast-moving political developments, critics have accused Biden of being unable to serve the remainder of his term if he is unable to campaign for a second term. Morgan blamed the mainstream media for protecting him and deceiving the American people about his cognitive abilities. 
""There was a complete conspiracy of delusion and deceit by the mainstream media in America to delude the American people about the reality of Joe Biden,"" he argued.

Legal experts are crying foul on possible plans that President Biden could support to make drastic changes to the Supreme Court. 
Before he abruptly dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the ticket, news reports indicated that Biden was considering supporting legislation that would attempt to impose term limits on Supreme Court justices and a new enforceable ethics code.
Such legislation would be a radical shift for Biden, who has historically resisted calls to expand the high court or push for any substantive changes. 
But since the Trump administration, which gave Republican appointees the majority, Biden could be shifting his views to accommodate the more extreme members of his party just months away from the presidential election. Legal experts warn, however, such congressional action ""undermines democracy.""

""The question of whether President Biden and his left wing could impose term limits or age limits on Supreme Court justices by statute alone and not a constitutional amendment is, at best, highly debatable and dependent on the devilish details that have not yet been released,"" John Shu, a constitutional attorney and former official in both Bush White Houses, told Fox News Digital. 
""Attempting to do so definitely undermines democracy and separation of powers, as well as the Constitution’s very structure. It also tries to delegitimize the court as an institution. A constitutional amendment would be the cleanest way to impose term or age limits on Supreme Court justices, but it’s a terrible idea for many reasons,"" he said. 
Shu noted that, in the past, Biden was ""publicly and strongly against court-packing and placing term limits on federal judges, both of which he called ‘boneheaded.’

FOX_16,Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces his first House of Commons grilling from lawmakers,https://www.foxnews.com/world/britains-new-prime-minister-keir-starmer-faces-first-house-commons-grilling-lawmakers,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,world,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Newly elected British leader Keir Starmer faced a House of Commons milestone on Wednesday, fielding lawmakers’ queries at the boisterous weekly Prime Minister’s Questions session.
It was the first such session since Starmer’s Labour Party won a landslide election victory on July 4, returning to power after 14 years. The center-left party won 412 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.
KEIR STARMER ELECTED NEW UK PRIME MINISTER AFTER BIG LABOUR PARTY WIN
Starmer is more accustomed to asking the questions after spending four years as leader of the opposition to a Conservative government. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak now fills that role as leader of the defeated Conservative Party.
Starmer was greeted with a loud cheer by Labour lawmakers packed onto the green benches in the Commons. The often rambunctious spectacle of PMQs struck an unusually cordial note, as Sunak and Starmer stressed their mutual commitment to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.

The prime minister told the opposition leader he ""wholeheartedly agree"" on the need to arm Ukraine and set it on the path to NATO membership — words not often heard between them.
The two politicians also sent best wishes to British athletes at the Paris Olympics, although, Sunak added, ""I’m probably not the first person they want to hear advice from on how to win.""
Labour won a landslide election victory over the Conservatives on July 4 on a promise to get the U.K.’s sluggish economy growing, unleash a wave of housebuilding and green energy projects and patch the country’s frayed public services.
Labour’s large majority means Starmer should easily be able to pass legislation. But he has already had to quell a rebellion, suspending seven Labour lawmakers for voting against the party over social welfare.
The government is under pressure from anti-poverty groups and many Labour lawmakers to scrap a policy introduced by the Conservatives that limits a widely paid welfare benefit and tax credit to a family’s first two children. The new government says it can’t afford to immediately abolish the two-child cap.
On Tuesday night, seven Labour lawmakers on the left of the party sided with an opposition call to scrap the limit. The party said the seven, who include former deputy leader John McDonnell, had been suspended from Labour’s parliamentary caucus for at least six months. They will remain lawmakers, but will sit as independents.

FOX_17,New Zealand inquiry reveals 'unimaginable' abuse in care institutions over 5 decades,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-inquiry-reveals-unimaginable-abuse-care-institutions-decades,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,world,"NXIVM survivor Sarah Edmondson shares details from her horrific experience with the cult on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
New Zealand’s wide-ranging independent inquiry into the abuse of children and vulnerable adults in care over the span of five decades released a blistering final report Wednesday that found the country’s state agencies and churches failed to prevent, stop or admit to the abuse of those they were supposed to look after — even when they knew about it.
The scale of the abuse was ""unimaginable"" with an estimated 200,000 people abused in seven decades, the report said. Scrutiny of state and faith-run institutions was lax and predators rarely faced repercussions.
In response to the findings, New Zealand’s government agreed for the first time that historical treatment of some children in a notorious state-run hospital amounted to torture, and pledged an apology to all those abused in state, foster and religious care since 1950. But Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said it was too soon to divulge how much the government expected to pay in compensation — a bill the inquiry said would run to the billions of dollars — or to promise that officials involved in denying and covering up the abuse would lose their jobs.
LAWSUIT ALLEGES DECADES OF CHILD SEX ABUSE AT ILLINOIS JUVENILE DETENTION CENTERS STATEWIDE
The publication of findings by the Royal Commission — the highest level of inquiry that can be undertaken in New Zealand — capped a six-year investigation that followed two decades of similar probes around the world, echoing other nations’ struggles to reckon with authorities’ transgressions against children removed from their families and placed in state and religious care.

The results were a ""national disgrace,"" the inquiry’s report said. Of 650,000 children and vulnerable adults in state, foster, and church care between 1950 and 2019 — in a country that today has a population of just 5 million — nearly a third endured physical, sexual, verbal or psychological abuse. Many more were exploited or neglected, the report said. The figures were likely higher, though precise numbers would never be known because complaints were disregarded and records were lost or destroyed.
""These gross violations occurred at the same time as Aotearoa New Zealand was promoting itself, internationally and domestically, as a bastion of human rights and as a safe, fair country in which to grow up as a child in a loving family,"" the inquiry heads wrote, using both the Māori and English names for the country.
""If this injustice is not addressed, it will remain as a stain on our national character forever,"" read the 3,000-page report.
DOZENS OF CHILDREN WERE ABUSED IN PENNSYLVANIA'S JUVENILE FACILITIES, LAWSUITS ALLEGE
Hundreds of survivors and their supporters filled the public gallery Wednesday in New Zealand’s Parliament, where lawmakers responded to the findings.
The report lambasted some senior figures in government and faith institutions, who it said continued to cover up and excuse abuse throughout public hearings into the matter. Many of the worst episodes had long been common knowledge, it said, and officials at the time of the abuse were ""either oblivious or indifferent"" about protecting children, instead shoring up the reputations of their institutions and of abusers.
The inquiry made 138 recommendations across all areas of New Zealand law, society and government. It adds to dozens of interim recommendations in 2021 that urged swift redress for those abused, some of whom were sick or dying — of which little has been enacted.
The government pledged Wednesday to supply answers by the end of the year about plans for redress, although the inquiry decried the scant progress made by successive governments to date.
The fresh recommendations include seeking apologies from state and church leaders, including Pope Francis, for the abuse of children and vulnerable adults and for disbelieving decades of accounts. The inquiry also endorsed creating dedicated offices to prosecute abusers and enact redress, renaming the streets and monuments that are currently dedicated to abusers, reforming civil and criminal law, rewriting the child welfare system, and searching for unmarked graves at psychiatric facilities.
Among investigations worldwide, New Zealand’s inquiry was notable for its scale — the widest-ranging such probe ever undertaken, according to those leading it. It examined abuse in state institutions, foster care, faith-based care, and medical and educational settings, interviewing nearly 2,500 survivors of abuse.
Children were removed arbitrarily and unfairly from their families, the report said, and the majority of New Zealand’s criminal gang members and prisoners are believed to have spent time in care.
As in Australia and Canada, Indigenous children were targeted for placement in harsher facilities and subject to worse abuse. The majority of children in care were Māori, despite the group comprising less than 20% of New Zealand’s population during the period examined.
The average cost of abuse in a survivor's lifetime is $508,000, the inquiry found. Health care and other government-funded measures account for less than a quarter of that cost, while the remainder quantifies the toll on the survivor of their pain, suffering, lost opportunities and early death.
Those abused have had little recourse under New Zealand law to sue or seek compensation, with some accepting small out-of-court settlements. As recently as 2015, New Zealand governments rejected the need for such an inquiry and government agencies argued that abuse had not been endemic.
Tu Chapman, a survivor and advocate, attended Parliament on Wednesday, where she told The Associated Press that immediate action was needed on redress to prove that the government took the findings seriously.
""Announce the redress system as soon as possible,"" she said. ""Further delay is just impacting survivors even more who have waited 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years.""
In comments to reporters Wednesday ahead of the report’s release, Luxon said the government now heard and believed survivors, and that he had been shocked by the findings.
""New Zealanders just don’t think this thing would happen, that abuse on this scale would ever happen in New Zealand,"" the prime minister said. ""We always thought that we were exceptional and different, and the reality is we’re not.""
Luxon said that when survivors tried to speak up with ""horrific and harrowing"" stories of abuse, the people charged with protecting them ""turned a blind eye."" The findings marked ""a dark and sorrowful day"" for the country, Luxon added.
While he could not yet say which recommendations he would commit to enacting, he said the government would formally apologize to survivors on Nov. 12.
Following Luxon’s speech, hundreds of survivors stood and sang a Māori song in an emotional scene.
Karen Chhour, a lawmaker for the libertarian ACT party who grew up in state care, told Parliament that New Zealand had ""tolerated rape and abuse of vulnerable people and the abuse of power"" for too long.
""It’s time we faced this poison that is rotting our nation from the inside,"" said Chhour, whose party is a member of the governing bloc.
Children and vulnerable adults were ""devalued and dehumanized,"" said Chris Hipkins, leader of Labour — New Zealand's main opposition party, which commissioned the inquiry while in power. The episode was ""a nationwide intergenerational shame"" that was far from over, he added.
Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, an opposition lawmaker and co-leader of the Māori Party, said she did not accept the government needed time to digest the report.
""What the hell has changed for us?"" Ngarewa-Packer asked Parliament on Wednesday, referring to what the inquiry said was continuing abuse of people in care — and current government crackdowns on gangs and youth offenders, many of whom spent time in care.

The report singled out churches — particularly the Catholic Church — as failing to address or prevent abuse. As many as 42% of those in faith-based care by all denominations were abused, according to a report produced for the inquiry. The Catholic Church said in a 2020 briefing to the commission that accusations had been made against 14% of its New Zealand clergy during the time covered by the inquiry.
In one recommendation, the inquiry’s authors exhorted an investigation into priests from one Catholic order who had been sent to Papua New Guinea to evade accusations of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, adding that little was known about ""the nature and extent of abuse and neglect there or the needs of potential survivors.""
Senior Catholic figures in New Zealand said in a written statement Wednesday that they had received the report and ""will now read and review it carefully."""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
One person was killed and three others injured at Cambodia’s famed centuries-old Angkor temple complex after a large tree was blown down onto their vehicle during a fierce rainstorm, a government statement said Wednesday.
The accident occurred late Tuesday afternoon at the southern gate to Angkor Thom, which is near the more famous Angkor Wat temple and part of the same archaeological complex in the northwestern province of Siem Reap, about 200 miles northwest of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The site is Cambodia’s most popular tourist attraction and in the first half of this year attracted more than half a million international tourists, according to Cambodia's Tourism Ministry.
CAMBODIA ARMY BASE EXPLOSION THAT KILLED 20 WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY MISHANDLING MUNITIONS, MILITARY OFFICIAL SAYS
The tree fell on a tuk-tuk — a kind of motorized three-wheeled vehicle popular in South and Southeast Asia — killing the driver instantly and injuring its three passengers, one critically, according to a statement issued by the Siem Reap Provincial Administration on Wednesday.

Several statues on the balustrade of what is called Tonle Oum Gate were also damaged by the fallen tree, the statement said.

The Apsara National Authority, the government agency that oversees the archaeological park, posted photos late Tuesday on its official Facebook page showing the fallen tree in front of the temple entrance. The agency later announced that the fallen tree had been removed so that the entrance was again accessible for visitors.
The Angkor site sprawls across some 155 square miles, containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia."
FOX_19,North Korean trash balloon drops garbage on South Korea’s presidential compound,https://www.foxnews.com/world/north-korean-trash-balloon-drops-garbage-south-koreas-presidential-compound,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,world,"Fox News contributor Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg discusses the global implications of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signing an 'aggression' pact on 'Your World.'
Trash carried by at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound on Wednesday, raising worries about the security of key South Korean facilities during North Korean provocations.
The rubbish that landed on the presidential compound in central Seoul contained no dangerous material and no one was hurt, South Korea’s presidential security service said. While North Korea likely lacks sophisticated technology to drop balloons on specific targets, some experts say South Korea should shoot down incoming North Korean balloons next time to protect major facilities because they might contain hazardous substances in the future.
North Korea's latest balloon launches came days after South Korea boosted its broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the two countries' heavily armed border. Their tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are inflaming tensions, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences.
SOUTH KOREA PREPARING 'STARWARS' LASER DEFENSE SYSTEM TO TAKE OUT NORTH KOREAN DRONES
Seoul officials earlier said North Korea used the direction of winds to fly balloons toward South Korea, but some of the past balloons had timers that were likely meant to pop the bags of trash in midair.
The security service gave no further details about the rubbish found at the presidential compound. It refused to disclose whether President Yoon Suk Yeol was at the compound when the balloons were flying over his office, a no-fly zone in South Korea.
If North Korea is found to have used timers or any other device to deliberately dump trash on the presidential office, it would invite a strong response by South Korea. But experts say dropping balloons on selected ground targets requires advanced technology and that North Korea would certainly lack such an ability.

""Some of (the hundreds of balloons) launched by North Korea landed on the presidential compound by coincidence. North Korea has no technology to precisely drop balloons at certain targets,"" said Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul.
Jung said that a GPS navigation device and a power system would need to be attached to a balloon to make it fall on certain sites and that North Korea doesn't possess such balloons. He said North Korea likely wanted the balloons to fall on Seoul, about an hour's drive from the border, after calculating factors like the weight of the trash bags tied to the balloons, the volume of air in the balloons and the weather conditions.
Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said strong winds in Seoul would also make it impossible for North Korea to target certain places with balloons.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said earlier Wednesday that North Korea had resumed floating balloons across the border, the 10th such launch since late May.
The more than 2,000 North Korean balloons discovered in South Korea in the past weeks carried wastepaper, scraps of cloth, cigarette butts and even manure. North Korea has said it was responding to South Korean activists who have scattered political leaflets across the border via their own balloons.
North Korea’s balloons haven’t caused any major damage but have raised security jitters among people worried it could use such balloons to drop chemical and biological agents.
South Korea has avoided shooting at the balloons because of possible damage caused by falling bullets and the chance that the balloons might contain hazardous substances.
Lee said South Korea should still shoot down North Korean balloons in border areas because attacking them over the populous Seoul area would be too risky if they contain dangerous items like biological agents. But there are worries that doing so could cause skirmishes with North Korea. Jung said South Korea could use recently developed laser weapons to intercept North Korean balloons.
Experts say North Korea considers leafleting activities by South Korean civilian groups a major threat to its efforts to stop the inflow of foreign news and maintain its authoritarian rule. In furious responses to past South Korean leafleting, North Korea destroyed an empty South Korean-built liaison office in its territory in 2020 and fired at incoming balloons in 2014.
South Korea said Sunday it was ramping up its anti-North Korean propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at all major sites along the land border because the North was continuing its launches of trash-carrying balloons. South Korea restarted its loudspeaker broadcasts last Thursday for the first time in about 40 days in retaliation for North Korea's previous balloon activities.
Observers say the propaganda broadcasts can demoralize front-line North Korean troops and residents. In 2015, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border in anger over South Korea's restart of propaganda broadcasts, prompting the South to return fire.

South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson Lee Sung Joon said the current South Korean broadcasts include K-pop songs and news on South Korean economic development. South Korean media reported the broadcasts also contained news on the recent defection of a senior North Korean diplomat and called the planting of land mines by North Korean soldiers at the border ""hellish, slave-like lives.""
South Korea has an estimated 40 loudspeakers — 24 stationary and 16 mobile ones. South Korea's military said Monday it was operating all of the fixed loudspeakers and plans to use the mobile loudspeakers as well.
North Korea hasn't officially responded to the South Korean propaganda broadcasts. But last week, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, threatened new countermeasures against South Korean civilian leafleting, warning that South Korean ""scum"" must be ready to pay ""a gruesome and dear price"" for their actions."

FOX_21,Families of US citizens held by Hamas pin hopes on Netanyahu’s address to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com/world/families-of-us-citizens-held-by-hamas-pin-hopes-netanyahus-address-congress,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,world,"Orna and Ronen Neutra, the parents of an American held hostage in Gaza, address the Republican National Convention.
JERUSALEM – With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set to address both houses of Congress on Wednesday, families of U.S. citizens held hostage by the Hamas terror group in Gaza for some 292 days expressed hope that he will use the high-profile platform to finally announce a cease-fire deal that will release them. 
Ahead of his flight to Washington, D.C., Netanyahu’s office released a statement saying that Israel would return to the negotiating table this week in the hopes of securing a deal with the U.S.-designated terror group to release hostages in exchange for a cease-fire of the nine-month-old war that has killed thousands on both sides. 
Eight U.S. citizens have been held by Hamas since Oct. 7, when hundreds of its elite Nukhba terrorists infiltrated southern Israel, brutally attacking army bases, civilian communities and a massive music festival taking place near the border. Some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were murdered in the attack, with an estimated 250 individuals taken captive by the Palestinian terror group. 
NETANYAHU'S 4 PRINCIPLES ISRAEL AGREES TO FOR HOSTAGE DEAL AS NEGOTIATIONS PICK UP

While a weeklong cease-fire last November secured the release of more than 100 of the hostages, around 120 people remain in captivity, including eight U.S. citizens: California-born Hersch Goldberg-Polin, 23, who moved to Israel with his family, was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival. Sagui Dekel Chen, 35, who grew up in New Jersey, and Keith Siegel, 64, from North Carolina, were both taken from their homes in kibbutz communities near the Gaza border. While Eden Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey, and Omer Neutra from Long Island, New York – both serving in the Israel Defense Forces – were taken from their military bases. 
In April, Hamas released video recordings of both Goldberg-Polin, who is known to have had his arm blown off during the Oct. 7 attack, and from Keith Siegel, giving hope to their families that they are still alive despite the longevity of their captivity. 
Three other U.S. citizens – Judy Weinstein and her husband, Gad Haggai, and 19-year-old Itay Chen – are believed to have been murdered in captivity by Hamas, who are still holding onto their bodies. An additional 44 hostages have also been declared dead by the Israeli military. 
Last week, Ronen and Orna Neutra, the parents of Omer Neutra, spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, calling on U.S. and Israeli leaders to strike a deal to release all the hostages. 
""This was not merely an attack on Israel; this was and remains an attack on Americans,"" Ronen Neutra said, highlighting that 45 of the 1,200 people murdered by Hamas on Oct. 7 were Americans.

On Monday, not long after he touched down in Washington, Netanyahu agreed to meet with representatives of the eight families, according to a readout. The families told the prime minister that their loved ones cannot wait any longer and that he must close the deal now. 
They also called on him to address the plight of the eight American hostages when he speaks to Congress on Wednesday.

""The families told Netanyahu in no uncertain terms that they expect him to announce this week that he has finalized the deal to bring their family members home,"" a statement from the meeting read. ""Anything less, they said, would constitute an abject failure of his trip to Washington."" 
Also on Monday, the families of U.S. hostages met with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and White House Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk, who said there is a solid deal on the table and that it would just take ""political determination and cooperation from both sides"" to secure it.
Netanyahu – who will also meet with President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump during his trip – also expressed hope that a deal could be achieved during a meeting with 13 additional hostage relatives, who traveled with him from Israel.

In that meeting, he said that he was ""determined to return them all"" and that ""the conditions for returning them are becoming ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas.""
Netanyahu also said that his visit to the U.S. and the chance to address lawmakers from both sides of the aisle and in both houses would afford him ""the opportunity to bring before the representatives of the American people, and the American people themselves the importance of their support for our efforts, with them, to bring about the release of all of the hostages, the living and the deceased.""

FOX_23,Trump-Vance foreign policy: US helps those who help themselves,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vance-foreign-policy-us-helps-those-who-help-themselves,2024-07-24 19:00:19.122200,opinion,"Rich Goldberg senior advisor at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies and former Trump administration NSC official, discusses the successes and pitfalls of Donald Trump's first term foreign policy, as well as what a second term might see.
Donald Trump knows how to set the American foreign policy blob's hair alight.
And he did it the other day when he said to Bloomberg Businessweek:
""I think Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.""
Signs reading ""America First Means America First"" are seen during preparations for the fourth day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum on July 18, 2024, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) 
Trump's wording can seem like a verbal version of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, but as is often the case, his instincts aren't far off the mark.
TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SHOWS TO PUTIN AND XI THE WEST ON BIDEN’S WATCH IS VULNERABLE, UNFOCUSED
Countries that expect the Americans to show up when trouble comes calling can’t say they haven’t been warned.
For too long, American elites seemed to regard sending U.S. troops abroad as a real-world graduate school seminar to test their IR theories. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright displayed that in spades when she chided Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for not wanting to deploy U.S. forces to Bosnia without a clear political objective:

""What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?""
Imagine the U.S. as a fire department with limited firetrucks.  If Israel, Ukraine, Poland, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines call 911 at the same time, who gets priority?
Ask any ambassador from these countries the same question and ask them who they would prioritize if they were the U.S.
TRUMP'S SECOND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT
It’s going to be whoever has done their best to ensure their house isn’t a fire trap, they’ve got plenty of fire extinguishers and are trying furiously to put the fire out.
Not the guy who skimped on fire prevention and is trying to untangle the garden house.
If there’s a Trump-Vance administration, any country that wants American help had better be doing everything it possibly can to defend itself if it expects the United States to offer up its troops.
As for Taiwan, there are darn good reasons for ensuring China doesn’t take it, and Trump needs to talk to his former national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. Yes it buys American hardware. But that’s not enough. 
For decades successive Taiwan administrations underfunded and paid scant attention to its military – seemingly oblivious to the China threat. The idea was that the Americans would show up when needed.
Japan? Something similar. It’s an important ally. But it underspent on defense for decades, and recently missed recruitment targets by 50%. The dirty secret: Japan’s military is not ready to fight a war. Not to worry, Japanese politicians would sometimes say when in their cups, our American guard dogs will protect us.
GOP LAWMAKER RIPS BIDEN'S 'WEAK' FOREIGN POLICY RECORD IN PREVIEW OF RNC SPEECHES: 'GLOBAL LAUGHINGSTOCK'
The Europeans, with just a few exceptions – Poland and few of the ""little"" countries – ignored U.S. requests to take defense seriously. They even laughed at President Trump when he warned them of danger – and ""blob"" back home called him an intemperate rube. Ukraine was a wakeup call, but even that doesn’t seem to have been enough.
The D.C. foreign policy crowd claims anyone who calls for caution when sending U.S. troops overseas or getting involved in someone else’s fight is an ""isolationist"" or an ""America Firster."" But they and their relatives (and even their friends) almost never serve in the forces.
And even worse, the foreign policy Brahmins don’t care much about the deplorables from flyover country who make up most of the U.S. military. 
The families whose children do serve never get asked what they think. And after 20 years of failure in Iraq and Afghanistan and seemingly open-ended commitments to Ukraine and the Middle East – and a brewing war in East Asia – they’ve got good reason to think the blob maybe isn’t all that smart.

They’re not isolationists. They’re patriots willing to risk all for the nation. 
But the lower orders (as the blob sees them) are no longer willing to write a blank check and hand it over to the foreign policy experts.
And making them even more leery, they watched the elite class ship industry and jobs overseas, do nothing to stem the flow of deadly drugs into their communities, while allowing 10 million illegal immigrants into the country – as a source of cheap and replacement labor.

So America’s friends around the world, if there is new Trump administration, you know what you need to do. American service members take on a world of responsibilities. If you ask someone from Kansas to be willing to die for you, you’d better be doing all you can to defend yourself first.
The more you do for yourself, the more likely it is you’ll get a fire truck sent your way when the time comes.

But based on my recent travels overseas from the Middle East to western and central Europe, I believe that the election results reflect not so much a popular swing to the right, but rather, a growing frustration with incumbent governments. 
True, the populist right has made inroads. Europe’s first populist pioneer, Hungary’s Viktor Orban, has won four consecutive elections as prime minister since his initial victory in 2010. Since then, he has transformed Hungary into what he has called an ""illiberal democracy,"" but what the European Parliament has denounced as an ""electoral autocracy."" 
In Italy in 2022, the right-wing populist Brothers of Italy won the highest vote share of any single part in the nation’s national election, propelling to power as prime minister its leader, Giorgia Meloni. In those national elections, four-in-ten Italian voters cast their ballots not just for the Brothers, but for the other two major right-wing parties, Forza Italia and Lega, up a third from the last election in 2018.

In sanctimoniously liberal Sweden, the right-wing Sweden Democrats emerged in 2022 as the second most popular party, the culmination of steady growth over the last six parliamentary elections and the near doubling of their vote share since the 2014 election. In the Netherlands in 2023, the victory of Geert Wilders’ far-right, anti-immigration Party for Freedom shocked much of Europe.
POPULISTS SHUT OUT OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL SYSTEMS THAT FAVOR ESTABLISHMENT PARTIES
Right-wing parties in Spain, the birthplace of fascism, and Germany – yes, Germany – have also steadily gained ground. The ""Alternative for Germany,"" the AFD, once considered taboo in light of German history, has recently won local elections in the country’s east and is now polling in second place nationally, tied with the Social Democrats, Germany’s main leftist party.

Sparked by widespread anti-immigrant sentiment and fury over rising prices, the success of these right-wing parties in Europe has prompted some pundits to predict that Donald Trump will reclaim the presidency in November. 
But there is also reason to believe that the election results reflect not so much an ideological swing to the right, but rather, a surge in anti-incumbency sentiment. Consider the recent elections in the U.K., France and Iran.
EUROPEAN VOTERS REJECT SOCIALISM, FAR-LEFT POLICIES IN EU PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS: 'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'
Earlier this month, the British, fed up with 14 years of conservative Tory misrule, gave Kier Starmer’s Labour Party a massive majority and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives a historic defeat. Acknowledging the widespread desire for change, Sunak did not dwell on another reason for the Tory’s weakness – the relative success of Nigel Farage, the right-wing, anti-immigrant disruptor.

Farage’s Reform party candidates, including Farage, won five Parliament seats that might well have gone to Sunak’s party, along with 14% of the national vote. But Labour trounced both of them, winning 410 of the 650 seats in parliament, an astonishing reversal of political fortunes from five years earlier when the socialists suffered their worst defeat since 1935.
In France, voters delivered an equally stunning setback to Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally, which pollsters had predicted would handily win the second round of the snap election that President Emmanuel Macron had called. But the RN came in third, as voters rejected both the populist right and Macron’s own party, endorsing instead a disputatious left-led alliance.

In Iran this month, voters turned out massively to reject the theocracy’s hard-line candidate, Saeed Jalili, who had won 44.3% of the votes in the election’s first round. In the second round, 49.8 % of registered voters endorsed the reformist candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian – a resounding defeat for the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei and his sclerotic authoritarian regime. The desire for change, especially among young Iranians, was palpable.
In all three contests, voters rejected the right but opted for change.
If, in fact, Americans share Europe’s and Iran’s anti-incumbent instincts, Trump might well be propelled to a landslide victory in November – particularly after the failed assassination attempt. Trump, a convicted felon, could well win despite his nostalgic slogan: Make America Great Again, Again.

While many Democrats sensed the widespread yearning for change at the top of their own presidential ticket, President Biden’s protracted resistance to withdrawing from the race has cost his party time, money and momentum. Despite the fact that he had been trailing Trump in the polls for months, long before his disastrous debate, Biden’s refusal to honor his initial campaign pledge to step aside after one term, and his adamant insistence that only he could defeat the MAGA candidate, threw his party into turmoil. 
Now that he has been forced to withdraw by colleagues who persuaded him that his name on the ballot would likely cost Democrats control of both the House and the Senate, Democrats have been scrambling to chart a winning course with Vice President Kamala Harris or another plausible, but unlikely alternative as their nominee. But now, at last, Americans may finally have the choice so many want — two versions of change, rather than the more conventional choice of incumbent versus challenger that Biden’s nomination would have ensured.

FOX_25,Netanyahu's speech to Congress: Can he rouse the world to the terror crisis it faces?,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/netanyahu-speech-congress-rouse-world-terror-crisis-faces,2024-07-24 17:00:19.122200,opinion,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discusses what’s at stake in Israel’s war against Hamas on ‘Hannity.’
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should use his Wednesday speech to a joint meeting of Congress to seek a renewal of bipartisan American support for Israel that began when the U.S. became the first nation to recognize the Jewish state’s independence in 1948.
Netanyahu, who is also scheduled to meet this week with President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former president Trump, will need to use his visit to remind elected officials and the American people of the threats his nation has faced since its creation. These include the current war that Gaza Strip-based terrorist group Hamas launched against Israel on Oct. 7, along with attacks against Israel by Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, who pose a far greater threat if full-scale war erupts. 
Presidents and members of Congress from both parties have supported Israel with economic aid and arms sales to defend itself for decades. But unfortunately, support for the Jewish state has dropped in recent years among Democrats and some young people on the left, who have staged hate-filled anti-Israel and antisemitic demonstrations on college campuses and elsewhere that have often degenerated into praise for terrorists.

Netanyahu’s challenge when he addresses Congress will be to counter lies leveled against Israel with facts in a compelling presentation. 
NETANYAHU'S 4 PRINCIPLES ISRAEL AGREES TO FOR HOSTAGE DEAL AS NEGOTIATIONS PICK UP
In the wake of an overwhelming vote July 17 by Israel’s parliament to oppose creation of a Palestinian state, Netanyahu should explain why the so-called ""two-state solution"" is no solution at all. He needs to say that Hamas and many Palestinians want a ""one-state solution,"" replacing the Jewish state with a radical Islamic and anti-American state dedicated to Israel’s annihilation.  
Even if a Palestinian state were controlled by the Palestinian Authority, which claims it would live in peace with Israel, the authority demands – without legal justification – that Israel give Palestinians the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, which is home to Judaism’s holiest sites and which no Israeli government could give up without falling. 
And even if a Palestinian state consisted of only the West Bank and Gaza, it would leave Israel dangerously vulnerable to missiles, rockets, drones, artillery and invasion. Israel would be only nine miles wide at its narrowest point, allowing invading Palestinian forces to cut the nation in two. Missiles could hit any city in Israel in two minutes or less. The threats would worsen with the development of new military technologies. 
The Israeli prime minister’s explanation of the dangers of a Palestinian state to Israel could serve as a rebuttal to the absurd and nonbinding decision by the International Court of Justice on Friday that Israel is illegally occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
NETANYAHU, ISRAEL BLAST UN COURT DECISION OVER ILLEGAL SETTLEMENTS RULING: 'FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG'
Netanyahu should say the claims that Israel is a colonial power of transplanted Europeans are absurd, given that Jews lived in and governed the land for thousands of years, until they were forced into exile. Condemning Jews as ""occupiers"" of their ancestral homeland makes as much sense as calling Native Americans ""occupiers"" of the United States.

In addition, Netanyahu should explain in his speech that like America, Israel is a thriving democracy that recognizes the rights of all of its citizens of every religion and ethnicity, including the 21% who are Arabs. 
Netanyahu can recognize that Palestinians deserve the right to control their internal affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, and live in peace and prosperity alongside Israel – but not to a state that would become a launching pad for terrorism.
Understandably, the tragic suffering and deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the widespread destruction in the current Israel-Hamas war have distressed the world. 
NETANYAHU DOUBLES DOWN ON CLAIM THAT BIDEN ADMIN IS REDUCING WEAPONS SHIPMENTS TO ISRAEL

But Israel did not start this war. Hamas launched it because it is more interested in killing Jews and wiping Israel off the map than in improving the lives of Gazans.
For years, Hamas has prioritized spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually to build terror tunnels, amass armaments and fund its terrorist forces deployed against Israel, rather than creating a thriving economy and jobs, and building public works projects, industries and housing for its own people.      
Netanyahu must make it clear that Hamas bears sole responsibility for what has happened in Gaza since it staged an unprovoked terrorist invasion of Israel on Oct. 7 and murdered about 1,200 people, including some Americans and other foreign nationals – most of them civilians. Even babies and the elderly were butchered, and women were brutally raped, tortured and killed. 
Hamas also took about 240 Israelis, Americans and others hostage. It continues to hold about 120 hostages in Gaza, including an unknown number who have died, and refuses to release all of them in exchange for far more Palestinian terrorists and other criminals imprisoned by Israel.  
DEMS HESITATE ON ATTENDING NETANYAHU SPEECH TO CONGRESS AS PARTY SPLINTERS ON ISRAEL
In addition, Hamas terrorists continue to hide in tunnels, hospitals, schools, mosques, apartment buildings and homes in Gaza, often making it impossible for Israel to strike terrorists without hitting civilians as well, despite Israel’s unprecedented precautions to limit civilian casualties. 
Netanyahu will doubtless note in his speech that Hamas and Hezbollah are funded and armed by the fanatical regime that rules Iran, which is committed to the destruction of America as well as Israel as it works to develop nuclear weapons. 
Netanyahu must make it clear that Hamas bears sole responsibility for what has happened in Gaza since it staged an unprovoked terrorist invasion of Israel on Oct. 7 and murdered about 1,200 people.
Iran and its terrorist proxy forces launched more than 300 missiles and drones against Israel in April, but nearly all were shot down by Israeli, U.S., British and Jordanian forces. Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are also backed by Iran, struck an apartment building in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv on Friday with a drone, killing a man and prompting Israel to retaliate with airstrikes against gas and oil depots and a power station at a port in Yemen.  
Even more alarmingly, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that Iran will be able to produce enough nuclear material in as little as a week or two to build an atomic bomb.

Netanyahu is likely to call on the U.S. and Arab nations to work in partnership with Israel in their mutual self-interest to contain Iran with crippling economic sanctions and a credible threat of a military response to Iranian use of force.
A Palestinian state would give Iran and its client terrorist groups an additional base to threaten not just Israel, but America’s Arab allies and U.S. forces in the Middle East, and would allow terrorists to add to the devastation they have inflicted on Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen.
It is unfortunate that Israel gets less support from Americans today than it did in years past because of propaganda successfully spread by those who hate Israel and Jews. I realize Netanyahu can’t instantly reverse this with one speech, but I hope he can make a strong case for why both Democratic and Republican officials and the American people should stand in solidarity with Israel and in opposition to its terrorist enemies and Iran.\

A resurgent Hamas ruling Gaza would inevitably lead to more suffering and death on the part of Palestinians as well as Israelis. The group must not be allowed to return to power. 
Rewarding Hamas, Hezbollah and others with the type of Palestinian state demanded by Palestinian leadership and hand-wringing diplomats at the United Nations and elsewhere would benefit no one except bloodthirsty terrorists who callously sacrifice Palestinian lives on the altar of their hatred for Jews and the Jewish state.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre held a press briefing for the first time since President Biden announced he would not be pursuing a second term and emphasized that his decision was not due to his health. 
After sharing their condolences to the family and friends of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who passed away over the weekend, as well as condemning the killing of Sonya Massey, who was fatally shot by an Illinois sheriff's deputy in her home, Jean-Pierre addressed Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race.
Reading from a letter Biden issued on Sunday, Jean-Pierre said, ""It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.""

Jean-Pierre defended the president and denied any notion of him resigning from his current post and proceeded to highlight his accomplishments during his term.  
""We believe and any suggestion of that note is ridiculous. I just laid out what the president has been able to do in almost four years, and it's been successful,"" Jean-Pierre stated. ""He's been able to do more again than any president has been able to do in two terms. He's been able to do that more in one term, and he wants to finish the job that he started and delivering more historic results for the American people.""

When asked why Biden stepped down and if it was related to his health, Jean-Pierre dodged the question again and deferred to the president's address on Wednesday evening.
""Again, the president's going to speak to this directly to the American people tonight in prime time. I know many of you all will be watching it. There are specials going on tonight. He will, I promise you, he will speak to this directly to all of you tonight,"" she said. ""But in his letter, he talked about the country. He talked about the party. He talked about the moment that we're in right now. It is not about his health. I can say no, that's not the reason. But hear him out tonight.""

""It's obviously a historic moment, but a decision like this is very personal. It's not easy to make. And I think there are very rare politicians who could look at the situation and make a decision.

""This is about the country and making, again, a personal, difficult decision. And so I think that speaks for itself, I really do."""

FOX_28,'Everyone’s mad': Fight to avoid government shutdown shatters House GOP peace,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/everyones-mad-fight-avoid-government-shutdown-shatters-house-gop-peace,2024-07-25 05:01:02.609200,politics,"Speaker Mike Johnson sat down with Fox News Digital for a wide-ranging interview on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.
The fight to avoid a government shutdown is again bringing out the fault lines within the House GOP’s razor-thin majority.
House Republican leaders sought to avoid another messy, drawn-out battle over federal funding this year by rolling out an ambitious schedule to pass all 12 individual appropriations bills before the annual August recess.
That effort has been all but derailed; rank-and-file Republicans are frustrated that GOP rebels are pushing for politically unpopular votes on measures that would likely not be in the final bills after compromising with the Democratic-held Senate. Fiscal conservatives and GOP rebels, however, accused the former of being unwilling to utilize their House majority.
Now some GOP lawmakers are accusing the latter of ""political masturbation"" while the rebels blast the ""terrible process"" that lawmakers have followed for years.

""Many of the appropriators are not excited about seeing some of these amendments being voted on. So, they vote against the amendments, and they get upset with those people when they don't vote for the full appropriations bill, so everybody's mad,"" one House Republican granted anonymity to speak freely told Fox News Digital.
A second House Republican said, ""Most of them I do philosophically agree with, so it's not that it's tough. It's that they're unnecessary. We know they're not going anywhere.""
""If you bring an amendment up that … makes me feel good … but it's literally not going to pass a markup, or it's not going to allow the bill to pass on the floor because the moderates are not going to like it, it's just political masturbation at that point. So, what are we doing?"" the second GOP lawmaker said.
""The rest of us can have that impact, too. We choose not to because we're trying to get these bills passed. We're actually trying to do our jobs here.""
GOP leaders had aimed to pass the bill funding the Justice and Commerce departments this week. But after it passed through committee absent an amendment defunding prosecutions against former President Trump and was bashed by the ex-president, lawmakers have yet to see it get a House-wide vote.

And on Tuesday evening, the Energy and Water appropriations bill was abruptly pulled from the House floor schedule amid worries about it passing.
""What we’re sick of is not passing the most conservative bills that we can get to be able to even start the negotiation,"" Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital. ""What a lot of people are upset about is trying to find a bill and vote on it on the House side that will pass the Senate. And … the conservative people in our party are wanting bills that represent the conservative principles of the Republican Party as a starting point.""
House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., said, ""They should be bringing these things out to the floor. They should be openly debated, discussed – and amendments proposed out there on the floor in front of all 435 members and, in the end, the American people – and that's not what's being done, and that's why we have this terrible process.""
It’s all but certain that Congress will have to pass a short-term extension of this year’s funding, known as a continuing resolution (CR), something that fiscal hawks who voted against last year’s funding packages will likely oppose.
Punting government funding into the new year or even into December will mean the next steps are largely dependent on who wins the presidential election.

""I'm disappointed that we have not been able to find a consensus to pass all the appropriations bills before the August recess. I hope we can do that in September. I think members have to be realistic about what their goals and objectives are for a CR until after the election,"" said Rep. French Hill, R-Ark.

House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole, R-Okla., confirmed to reporters that a short-term bill would be necessary to avoid a partial government shutdown.
""I've always said we'd have to do a CR,"" Cole said. ""And then whoever wins the election will make the decision, do you want a deal by the end of the year or do you want to kick them to the next Congress? I hope, my advice to whoever wins, would be do it by the end of the year.""

FOX_31,Obama's inner circle signals 44th president firmly behind Harris despite not saying so publicly,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-inner-circle-signals-44th-president-firmly-behind-harris-despite-not-saying-so-publicly,2024-07-25 07:21:02.789816,politics,"'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier reacts to California Rep. Adam Schiff calling for President Biden to exit the 2024 race on 'America Reports.'
Former President Obama has not yet endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president, though allies in the Obama orbit indicate the 44th president is squarely behind Harris’ campaign. 
President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race Sunday afternoon in a letter posted to his X account, which was shortly followed by him endorsing Harris for president. Democrats nationwide soon united in their calls for Harris to become the party’s nominee as they square up for another election battle against former President Donald Trump. 
Though Democratic leaders such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, as well as the Clintons and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have offered Harris their endorsements, Obama has remained mum. 
""Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times — and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on,"" Obama wrote in his statement following Biden bowing out, which did not including mentioning Harris. 
GROWING LIST OF OBAMA ALLIES, FORMER ADVISERS LOOK TO SINK BIDEN RE-ELECTION BID

Since leaving the Oval Office, Obama has typically held his endorsement card close to his chest. He endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in June of 2016, while his endorsement of Biden in 2020 was only made days ahead of the DNC. 
Obama remained coy for a long while during the 2020 election about whom he would endorse, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democratic contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary race and cleared a path for Biden, however, Obama finally endorsed his former veep in August of that year. 
Harris was also a contender in the 2020 race, and had long had a friendship with Obama prior to her 2020 run, sparking media speculation that the 44th president could throw his support behind Harris instead of his VP. 
OBAMA ALLIES, ADVISERS HELPED LEAD THE CHARGE AMONG DEMS LOOKING TO SINK BIDEN AHEAD OF OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT
Harris was among the first elected Democrats in the nation to endorse Obama’s first run for president in the 2008 election, snubbing Hillary Clinton in favor of the then-Illinois senator.

""I’m told that I was the first elected person in California to endorse [Obama] when he decided to run for president,"" Harris said back in 2019 while she was campaigning for president. ""I will remind you, and it is important to know, that early in those days Joe Biden was running against him.""
Harris was in attendance when Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, after first meeting him 2004 when he was an Illinois state senator running for the U.S. Senate, the Washington Examiner previously reported. 
""Barack Obama will be a president who finally ends the era of fear that has been used to divide and demoralize our country,"" Harris said during California's Democratic convention in 2008. 
As Harris built her political career from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then senator, Harris was even dubbed ""the female Obama"" by some political analysts. 
EX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'
Fast forward to Harris’ 2020 campaign for the presidency, those in Obama's orbit rallied around Harris’ campaign while the 44th president kept quiet. Public relations executive Michael Kempner and his wife held a fundraiser for Harris in the Hamptons that cycle, after they raised millions for Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign, Politico reported at the time. Eugene Duffy, who served as national finance committee member for Obama in 2008, helped fundraise for Harris that cycle, as did Obama donor and supporter, Jeff Shell, the former CEO of NBCUniversal.

Though Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama’s former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris’ potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama’s 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden’s 2024 reelection campaign chair, was announced as Harris’ campaign manager. 
OBAMA SILENT OVER REPORTS HE'S WORKING ‘BEHIND THE SCENES’ TO FORCE BIDEN OUT OF THE 2024 RACE
Ahead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.

Obama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is ""not winning this race."" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.
OBAMA AGAIN STEPPING INTO ROLE AS JOE'S CLOSER AHEAD OF TRUMP V BIDEN REMATCH
Another ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor — known collectively as the ""Obama Bros"" when they worked in the White House — also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of ""Pod Save America"" this month to trashing Biden. 
The ""Obama Bros"" and other former advisers in Obama’s orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris’ run. 
As momentum builds behind Harris’ candidacy, with the DNC anticipated to certify her as the nominee on Aug. 1, Obama’s statement Sunday follows his history of not expeditiously tipping the political scales in favor of one candidate over another.

​​""We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,"" Obama said in his statement on Sunday. ""I believe that Joe Biden’s vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.""

CNN_1,Pennsylvania state police commissioner reveals stunning details about Trump shooting,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/pennsylvania-state-police-commissioner-reveals-stunning-info-about-trump-shooting/index.html,2024-07-25 04:58:00,politics,"
            A local law enforcement commissioner revealed during a House Homeland Security hearing on Tuesday stunning new details about the security failures that led to the near assassination of Donald Trump, raising more questions for the embattled US Secret Service.
    

            Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris’ striking testimony comes just one day after now-resigned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testified before the House Oversight Committee and largely declined to answer questions about the shooting at the former president’s Pennsylvania rally.

Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigns


            Paris told lawmakers about the communications between the Secret Service and local law enforcement who initially spotted Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin. He also described a more detailed timeline from when officers first spotted Crooks in the crowd to when the 20-year-old opened fire on Trump.
    

            Here’s what to know from Tuesday’s hearing:
    

            Paris testified that two local law enforcement officers left a building with vantage points overlooking the roof where Crooks took aim at the former president before he fired shots, but the local district attorney later said the building was never unmanned.
    

            Paris said that two officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, a tactical force with sniper capabilities, left their posts in the building to look for a suspicious individual they spotted first and alerted to other law enforcement. That person was Crooks.
    

            Wednesday, Butler County DA Richard Goldinger disputed the testimony, saying that only one of the ESU officers left the building briefly to search for Crooks.
    

            “Both ESU officers moved within the building, attempting to keep eyes on Crooks,” Goldinger said in a statement. “One of the officers observed Crooks sitting on a picnic table at the front of the building from his location on the second floor of the building. Crooks then ran off, carrying a backpack.”
    

            “At this point, that officer ran out of the building attempting to keep eyes on Crooks until other law enforcement arrived. The other officer remained in the building, on the second floor,” Goldinger said. “The officer who ran out of the building could not locate Crooks, and he returned to the building. Both officers then heard shots fired.”
    

            Goldinger added that “neither officer could see Crooks on the other building due to the visual angle they had from their location to Crooks’ location.”
    

            Investigators believe that Crooks fired eight rounds before he was killed by counter-snipers, Paris said.
    

            “I believe that the number is eight,” Paris told the committee. “Eight casings have been recovered.”
    

            Officials had previously only confirmed that the shooter fired multiple times at the rally earlier this month.
    

            Paris also told members of Congress that “several Secret Service agents” told the state police area commander during a walkthrough of the area before the rally that the Butler County Emergency Services Unit was responsible for securing the building where Crooks fired the shots.
    

            A municipal officer came face-to-face with Crooks during the several minutes the would-be assassin was on the roof before Crooks fired on Trump, Paris testified.
    

            Paris said that the brief confrontation came as a pair of local officers who had learned of Crooks’ position on the roof attempted to climb up and confront the shooter. But while the officer was “dangling” from the roof, Crooks aimed his rifle at the officer and the officer fell.


            Paris told lawmakers that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes, but only a few seconds passed between when the officer confronted him and when he fired at Trump, correcting a timeframe he gave earlier in the hearing.
    

            “When the one local officer hoisted the other one up, and subsequently falls,” Paris said, Crooks was “already, I believe, close to being in his final position there. And I’m told it’s – again, sequence of events, not a timeline based on the prior criteria laid out – but seconds after that is when the first shots rang up.”
    

            Paris said that whether, or when, the confrontation was relayed to the Secret Service or other law enforcement agencies at the rally “remains under investigation.”
    

            Paris also detailed communications among law enforcement about Crooks before Trump took the stage at the rally earlier this month.
    

            According to Paris, “there was a text thread going” with members of the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, some of whom initially spotted Crooks and reported him as a suspicious individual.
    

            “At some point when he utilized the range finder, the suspicion was heightened,” Paris said of Crooks.
    

            State Police then received a call and a text from the ESU about Crooks’ activity that they immediately relayed to Secret Service. Local, state and federal law enforcement were in a unified command post at the rally.
    

            State Police “verbally turned right around and gave it to the Secret Service,” Paris said.
    

This story has been updated Wednesday with the response from Butler County DA Richard Goldinger.

CNN_2,Netanyahu decries critics of war in Gaza as ‘Iran’s useful idiots’ in speech to Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/benjamin-netanyahu-address-washington/index.html,2024-07-25 04:49:00,politics,"
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broadly criticized protests against Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, forcefully decrying anti-Israel protestors as “Iran’s useful idiots” in an address to Congress on Wednesday.
    

            Netanyahu’s address to Congress comes at a crucial crossroads for the war. US officials have voiced optimism about the prospects of a deal that could free Hamas-held hostages and bring the conflict to an end. It also comes as many on the left have become increasingly dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu has waged the war, which has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe.
    

            The US has seen protests across the country on college campuses and elsewhere in opposition to the war against Hamas. On the day of Netanyahu’s speech, there were protests both outside and inside the US Capitol complex. Additionally, the Secret Service is investigating reports that protestors gained access to the hotel building where Netanyahu is staying in Washington, DC, releasing bugs in the hotel and pulling fire alarms, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    

            Netanyahu painted protestors with a broad brush, claiming that “many choose to stand with evil” and that “they stand with Hamas” and “rapists and murderers.”
    

            In his address to Congress, Netanyahu referenced a recent statement from US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines that Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the conflict in Gaza.
    

            In her statement, Haines said, however, that she wanted “to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza,” adding that “this intelligence does not indicate otherwise.”
    

            “I have a message for these protestors: When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, either as a protest of the war or due to previously scheduled events. The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly become a dividing line among Democrats, exposing rifts within the party.
    

            At one point, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a sign during the speech that on one side said: “war criminal,” and the other side said: “guilty of genocide.”
    

            Netanyahu also delivered a stark warning against the threat of antisemitism in his remarks.
    

            “Antisemitism is the world’s oldest hatred,” he said. “Just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the Jewish people, malicious lies are now being leveled at the Jewish state. The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state and to demonize Jews everywhere.”
    

            “Whenever and wherever we see the scourge of antisemitism, we must unequovically condemn it and resolutely fight it without exception,” Netanyahu said during the speech to loud cheers and applause from members of Congress.
    

            Netanyahu thanked Biden during his speech for his support for Israel, even as Biden’s relationship with Netanyahu has grown steadily colder as the war in Gaza has lagged on and as the death toll in the beleaguered enclave continues to rise. Both leaders have known each other for decades, but have traded not-so-subtle barbs at each other as their disagreements with the war’s future have spilled into the public.
    

            “I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,” he said, thanking Biden “for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.”
    

            The speech to Congress comes as the bulk of the nation’s attention has been focused in recent weeks on discussions surrounding Biden’s age and mental fitness – which culminated in Biden announcing over the weekend that he would step down from the Democratic ticket – along with the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Convention.
    

            “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,” Netanyahu said.
    

            During his speech to Congress, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of close ties between the US and Israel.
    

            “For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,” Netanyahu said to loud cheers from lawmakers in attendance. “Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.”
    

            There were moments of bipartisanship during the speech. Twice when Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden, both sides gave him a standing ovation. When Netanyahu condemned political violence, that prompted another standing ovation from both sides.

Netanyahu’s long history of confounding US presidents


            Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.
    

            Biden has said that Israel has reached its stated goal, described the country’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” and plainly stated his desire for the war to end. The president has said it is “uncertain” whether Israel had committed war crimes. He has also hinted that he believes Netanyahu is dragging out the war only for the sake of his own political survival.
    

            Netanyahu, meanwhile, has accused the United States of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Netanyahu forcefully defended Israel’s right to self-defense in his remarks, saying, “the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always defend itself.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            After arriving in Washington earlier this week, Netanyahu met with some American relatives of hostages held by Hamas. Not all participants were pleased with how that meeting ended.
    

            Trump and Netanyahu will also meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            A number of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, with some declining to attend in protest over the war or because of previously scheduled events.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, did not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, but she is planning to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official told CNN. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech.
    

            Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would skip the address in protest of the “total war” Netanyahu’s government has waged in Gaza.
    

            “No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,” Sanders said in a statement. “On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned.”

CNN_3,"Roger Stone sentencing proposal change was ‘highly unusual’ but politics didn’t play an improper role, DOJ watchdog says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/roger-stone-justice-department-ig-report/index.html,2024-07-25 04:44:00,politics,"
            The Justice Department’s decision to water down the sentence proposal for Roger Stone, a Donald Trump ally convicted of lying to Congress, was was “highly unusual,” the department’s internal watchdog said Wednesday, but that it did not find evidence that politics played an improper role.
    

            The investigation was launched after the Justice Department issued a second sentencing memo for Stone called for a prison sentence “far less” than the 7-9 year recommendation his trial team initially put forward.
    

            The reversal came after Trump tweets bashing the initial recommended range, and on the day the second memo was filed, all four members of the Stone trial team quit the case – one of them resigning from the Justice Department altogether.
    

            Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison, but that sentence was ultimately commuted by Trump.
    

            However, the inspector general found in Wednesday’s report that even career department lawyers believe “reasonable minds” can disagree on whether the initial sentencing recommendation for Stone was too high.
    

            The report also revealed that after Aaron Zelinsky, one of the line prosecutors on Stone’s case, testified to Congress in 2020 about indications of improper pressure to cut Stone a “break,” top officials in the US attorney’s office reported him for allegedly false testimony to the DOJ office that investigates misconduct by its attorneys.
    

            Inspector General Michael Horowitz said that, while his office did not find “evidence sufficient to establish improper political considerations or influence,” Zelinsky was not “unreasonable” in the beliefs he communicated to Congress because of comments made to him by other DOJ officials.
    

            The new inspector general report said that the department’s move to file a second sentencing memo for Stone was “highly unusual” and that the involvement of then-Attorney General Bill Barr and the interim DC US attorney at the time “resulted in questions being asked and allegations being made about the Department’s decision making.”
    

            The IG noted that Barr declined to be interviewed in the probe, as did other members of department leadership during the Trump administration.
    

            The inspector general placed the blame on the then-interim US Attorney in DC, Timothy Shea, and his “ineffectual leadership, which was marked by indecisiveness and poor communication.” After putting off a decision on whether to overrule the trial team’s proposed recommendation, Shea waited until the day the filing was due to seek Barr’s advice, the report said.
    

            Despite discussing with Barr a strategy to suggest a sentence below the recommended range, Shea nonetheless signed off on the first memo. Barr told his staff that evening, after seeing the news of the higher recommendation, that it needed to be “fixed,” according to the report.
    

            “Thus, we found that Barr had articulated his position about the sentencing recommendation both before and shortly after the first sentencing memorandum was filed, and before the President’s tweets,” the inspector general said.
    

            Shea did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, nor did Barr.
    

            The 85-page report detailed the intense and sometimes heated internal deliberations in the lead-up to the initial sentencing filing, as the trial team’s supervisors repeatedly urged them to soften the proposed recommendation.
    

            Over time, the line prosecutors came to believe that politics was causing their Stone proposal to get much more scrutiny and pushback than what they’d see for a typical defendant. The comments during these deliberations formed a “substantial basis” for Zelinsky’s congressional testimony, the inspector general said.
    

            “The rule of law depends on prosecutors pursuing and telling the truth. My client is gratified the report confirms that he told the truth about what he saw and heard,” Zelinksy’s attorney Joshua Matz told CNN.

CNN_4,Democrats approve rules for likely Harris nomination,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/democrats-rules-kamala-harris-nomination/index.html,2024-07-25 03:52:00,politics,"
            Democrats on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Kamala Harris likely to begin August 1.
    

            That would be less than two weeks after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for reelection and endorsed his vice president, who quickly consolidated support within the party for her presidential bid. In just the first few days of her campaign, Harris earned the backing of hundreds of Democratic elected officials, including all her potential challengers, and it took her less than 36 hours to secure the support of enough delegates to win the nomination.
    

            Under the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention’s rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidacies and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting toward the threshold.
    

            Voting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end. If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates. Delegates will have 36 hours’ notice before voting begins.

            The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio. While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won’t take effect until the end of August.
    

            While all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates – senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their current or past positions – will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full Democratic convention. That could be determined by a candidate either winning enough votes during remote balloting or gathering a sufficient number of signatures.
    

            After a presidential candidate is nominated, the rules allow the nominee to name a running mate without the need for additional remote voting.
    

            The rules also call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote.

CNN_5,Takeaways from FBI testimony: Trump shooter searched details of JFK assassination and flew drone near rally site,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fbi-wray-house-hearing-trump-shooting/index.html,2024-07-25 02:31:00,politics,"
Donald Trump’s would-be assassin searched for details of the John F. Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.
    

            The stunning revelations are the latest details about the investigation to come to light this week in congressional hearings about the Trump rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.


            At the wide-ranging House Judiciary Committee hearing, Wray also shared that investigators believe that Thomas Matthew Crooks use a gun with a collapsable stock and that he accessed the roof of the building by climbing, not with a ladder.
    

            The hearing included a large share of politics, as Republicans repeatedly mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris as they sought to tie the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to border policy and other actions, and Democrats asked Wray repeatedly about Project 2025.
    

            Here are the key takeaways from Wednesday’s hearing:
    

            According to the FBI’s analysis of Crooks’ laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed Kennedy in 1963.
    

            The search was on July 6, the same day he registered to attend the rally.
    

            “On July 6, he did a Google search for: ‘how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,’” Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.
    

            “That’s a search that’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” the FBI director added. “That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.”
    

            Wray revealed that “around 4 p.m.,” Crooks “was flying the drone around the area” of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.

            The drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.
    

            In addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.
    

            “It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,” Wray said.
    

            Wray said that investigators have been able to “reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,” and now think that the drone footage “would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.”
    

            “It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,” Wray said.
    

            The FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.
    

            Investigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.
    

            The rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.
    

            “The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he – as my understanding – acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,” Wray said.
    

            Previously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks’ father – not the shooter – and they didn’t know how Crooks accessed the weapon.
    

            “I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,” Wray said. “The shooter may be deceased but the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.”
    

            Investigators have gone through the shooter’s phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.
    

            Crooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.
    

            The FBI thinks Crooks used equipment and piping attached to the building to climb up onto the roof where he shot at Trump.
    

            “We now believe the subject climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,” Wray said. “In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.”
    

            The FBI, according to Wray, confirmed that Crooks had previously purchased a roughly five-foot ladder.
    

            Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified Tuesday that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired at Trump.
    

            As Wray testified, GOP members pushed the FBI director to discuss any meetings he has had with Harris during her tenure as vice president, a notable line of questioning now that she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
    

            The questions ranged from whether Wray has regular briefings with Harris, what her behavior is like in those meetings and what sort of issues she has expressed concerns about.
    

            In one exchange, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked how frequently Harris attends briefings that Wray has with President Joe Biden. Wray declined to answer with any specificity.
    

            Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Wray whether Harris “has met with you in regard to the border, or whether she has “specifically asked you for a meeting” about the “threats that are at the border.”
    

            Wray said that he had “been in meetings that include the vice president” in which the border was discussed, but again declined to discuss specific meetings or conversations.
    

            Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also asked about Wray’s meetings about the border with Harris, asking whether the vice president has “actually initiated” meetings on a regular basis “as the leading border czar.” Wray did not answer.
    

            Wray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.
    

            “The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,” Wray said. He continued, “so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.”
    

            The FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks’ motive is ongoing, but warned that “it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.”
    

             Wray said Wednesday that an FBI employee is being internally investigated for posting something “totally inappropriate” about the Trump assassination attempt.
    

            Republican Rep. Chip Roy asked the director whether “any FBI agents texted, emailed or expressed disappointment that Trump survived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized about the assassination attempt?”
    

            Wray said he wasn’t aware of any agents acting inappropriately but that there had been one instance “of an individual who posted something that I consider outrageous, totally inappropriate, and unacceptable.”
    

            “That individual has been referred to our inspection division, which is our sort of internal affairs investigatory arm that does the disciplinary process,” Wray said.
    

            Wray did not say where the post was made.
    

            Wray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it’s likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such “brazenness” from Iran in the future.
    

            The director declined to provide details of “specific, classified information,” to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out “efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.”
    

            “I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we’re going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,” Wray said.
    

            CNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There’s no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.
    

 Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency’s hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party’s decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.
    

            “Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?” Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.
    

            “Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?” Schiff said.
    

            “No,” Wray replied.
    

            “So they would never be hired by the bureau?”
    

            “No,” Wray said again.
    

            “Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America’s great political parties,” Schiff said.
    

            Trump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.
    

            Wray testified that he opposes the idea of having the head of the law enforcement agency report directly to the president, a proposal pushed by some Trump supporters.
    

            The restructuring proposal for the FBI is outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that was created in part by more than 140 former Trump administration employees. Under the plan, the FBI director would no longer report directly to officials within the Justice Department and instead would answer to the president.
    

            “I don’t think that would be a wise approach,” Wray told Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson, when asked about the idea.
    

            “I was appointed by President Trump – I respect that. I think that’s part of our structure,” Wray said. “But independence in terms of how we do our work is what matters to me. And we need to be able to do our work in a way that is free from political interference.”
    

            Wray said he has not read or reviewed Project 2025 and did not comment specifically on it.

CNN_6,"What is DEI? Republicans are using the term to attack Kamala Harris, but experts say it’s widely misunderstood",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/dei-kamala-harris/index.html,2024-07-25 02:09:00,politics,"
            The ongoing controversy surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion has spilled over into the 2024 presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris on the path to becoming the Democratic nominee.
    

            Earlier this week, Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that President Joe Biden chose Harris as a running mate because she was a Black woman.
    

            “100% she is a DEI hire,” Burchett said.
    

            Supporters have defended Harris, who, if elected, would become the nation’s first female president.
    

In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, UN ambassador Susan Rice called the attacks from Republicans “extremely offensive and dehumanizing.”
    

            Rice said the attacks insinuate that people from marginalized groups who achieve success or rise to leadership roles didn’t earn it.
    

            “That is incredibly insulting,” Rice said.

A GOP congressman called Kamala Harris a ‘DEI hire.’ Some caution it’s a sign of what’s to come


            But Harris isn’t the first target in Republicans’ efforts to discredit people of color and the programs that help promote diversity.
    

            Since 2023, 85 anti-DEI bills that target programs at colleges have been introduced in 28 states and in Congress, according to a tally by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Fourteen have been signed into law, in states like Texas and Florida.
    

A 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 52% of employed US adults said they have DEI trainings or meetings at work, and 33% said they have a designated staff member who promotes DEI.
    

            But recently, some companies have slashed teams dedicated to DEI. And wealthy corporate leaders such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have made posts on social media that decried diversity programs.
    

            Critics say DEI programs are discriminatory and attempt to solve racial discrimination by disadvantaging other groups, particularly White Americans. But supporters and industry experts insist the decades-old practice has been politicized and is widely misunderstood.
    

            CNN interviewed seven DEI experts and industry leaders and asked each to define diversity, equity and inclusion. Although their responses varied slightly, most had a shared vision for what constitutes DEI:
    

            – Diversity is embracing the differences everyone brings to the table, whether it’s someone’s race, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability or other aspects of social identity.
    

            – Equity is treating everyone fairly and providing equal opportunities.


            – Inclusion is respecting everyone’s voice and creating a culture where people from all backgrounds feel encouraged to express their ideas and perspectives.

DEI efforts are under siege. Here’s what experts say is at stake


            Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective, a consultancy that advises companies on DEI, said DEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings.
    

            “That is the genesis of why some of these programs exist,” he said. “It was an attempt to try to create workplaces where more or all people can thrive.”
    

            President Lyndon Baines Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act on July 2, 1964. The law made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and barred unequal application of voter registration requirements. It also banned segregation in public places, like public schools and libraries.
    

            The backlash against DEI may feel like a pendulum swing from 2020, when the nation faced a racial reckoning following George Floyd’s death. But the DEI practice has been around for decades.
    

            Dominique Hollins, founder of the DEI consulting firm WĒ360, said the origins of DEI programs date back to the civil rights movement, which played a pivotal role in accelerating efforts to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces.
    

            Title VII of the Civil Rights Act established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which works to eliminate employment discrimination.
    

            In the 1960s and ‘70s, employees began filing discrimination lawsuits with the EEOC, and many companies began incorporating diversity into their business strategies by providing diversity training, according to a 2008 report published in the Academy of Management Learning & Education.
    

            These diversity training efforts emerged around the time that affirmative action began by executive order from President John F. Kennedy. Although the two concepts may seem similar, affirmative action is different from DEI because it required federal contractorsto treat all applicants and employees equally, regardless of race, color, religion and sex.
    

            Colleges and universities also used affirmative action to boost enrollment of students of color at majority-White schools. But last year, the Supreme Court gutted affirmative action, ruling that race-conscious college admissions were unconstitutional.

            After President Ronald Reagan backed corporate deregulation policies that said companies should be addressing discrimination internally in the 1980s, Hollins said some of the diversity efforts lost momentum.
    

            In the decades that followed, Hollins said, many companies kept pushing for DEI-focused jobs and training in a “piecemeal” fashion, instead of creating ongoing programs and dedicated teams.
    

            Hollins said many companies didn’t have the staffing or resources to sustain DEI efforts.
    

            But Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police in May 2020 sparked a racial reckoning and a renewed push for creating DEI leadership roles and initiatives at major corporations.
    

            Between 2019 and 2022, chief diversity and inclusion officer roles grew by 168.9%, according to a LinkedIn analysis.
    

            Today, some of those efforts have been rolled back, and people have left DEI roles because they didn’t feel fully supported, Hollins said.
    

            Companies “were giving the appearance of commitment without actually doing the right work for that commitment to be sustainable,” Hollins said.
    

            Despite the backlash against DEI programs and initiatives, many companies are standing firm in their support for DEI. 


            A survey published in January by the polling firm Ipsos found 67% of people surveyed said their employers require or offer trainings, lectures, webinars, or resources on DEI. And 71% of people surveyed said they think DEI training is important to “creating a positive workplace culture.”
    

            Today, studies show that many companies are prioritizing some form of DEI. According to a 2023 study by the Pew Research Center, 61% of U.S. adults say their workplace has policies that focus on fairness in hiring, promotions or pay. And 56% of U.S. adults say “focusing on increasing diversity, equity and inclusion at work is mainly a good thing.”


            Kelly Baker, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at Thrivent, an organization that provides financial advice, said DEI in the workplace can be a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices.
    

            Her company, for example, has resource groups for women in leadership, young professionals, Black employees, Hispanic employees and military veterans, among others.
    

            Thrivent’s DEI training teaches employees how to understand and bridge cultural differences in the workplace, Baker said.
    

            Thrivent also seeks job candidates with diversity in their race, geography, gender and industry background, Baker said.
    

            Experts say many corporations tie DEI to their business strategies.
    

            Diversity “is related to our business growth strategy,” Baker said. “It’s pragmatic and essential and critical for us to ensure that our client base reflects the world that we are in and the world that we are going to be in.”
    

            College campuses have become ground zero for the DEI debate as state lawmakers across the country launch efforts to halt or limit DEI programs in public schools and universities.
    

            Earlier this year, the University of Florida eliminated the office of its chief diversity officer to comply with regulations from the Florida Board of Governors that prohibit spending state funds on DEI programs.
    

            Ella Washington, professor of practice at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, said she is concerned that efforts to ban DEI on college campuses will prevent students from being prepared for the real world.
    

            “I think a lot of it is short-sighted and politically motivated,” Washington said. “It’s hard for me to believe that all of these lawmakers want exclusion be taught and to erase all of history.”
    

            Washington said while DEI looks different on every college campus, many schools focus efforts on recruitment and admissions, curriculum and special programs for underrepresented students.
    

            Georgetown’s Office of Student Equity & Inclusion oversees several DEI-centered programs including the Disability Cultural Center, Women’s Center, LGBTQ Resource Center and the Center for Multicultural Equity and Access, according to its website.
    

            Washington said there is also a program for first-generation college students where they have a chance to build community.
    

            Prioritizing and embracing a diverse student body allows students to interact with peers from different walks of life and learn new perspectives even outside of the classroom, Washington said.
    

            “Colleges are certainly a microcosm of the world,” Washington said. “So, having an experience where equity is centered, equality is considered, inclusion is at the forefront of people’s minds, those are things we are teaching the next generation about how they should be running the world.”
    

            In recent years, DEI has become a social and political lightning rod for lawmakers, corporate leaders and conservative activists, who have sought to cast the initiatives as unfair and even racist.
    

            Some were emboldened by the Supreme Court’s decision to gut affirmative action last June.
    

            Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an outspoken critic of DEI, wrote in a New York Times op-ed last year that “these are not neutral programs to increase demographic diversity; they are political programs that use taxpayer resources to advance a specific partisan orthodoxy.”
    

            The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank, holds a similar position. Ryan P. Williams, president of the institute, previously told CNN he believes the ideology behind DEI is “fundamentally anti-American.”
    

            “The words that the acronym ‘DEI’ represent sound nice, but it is nothing more than affirmative action and racial preferences by a different name, a system that features racial headcounts and arbitrarily assigned roles of ‘oppressor’ and ‘oppressed’ groups in America,” Williams said in an emailed statement. “If we continue to do democracy this way, it will only end in acrimony, strife, resentment, and American collapse.”
    

            Earlier this year, billionaire investor Bill Ackman posted a 4,000-word opus on X that criticized DEI as “inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.” Ackman’s lengthy thesis was later reposted by billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who now owns the social media platform.
    

            “DEI is just another word for racism. Shame on anyone who uses it,” Musk wrote in his post.
    

            In a follow-up post, Musk doubled down, adding: “DEI, because it discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors, is not merely immoral, it is also illegal.”
    

            Tesla, which is owned by Musk, has since omitted all language regarding minority workers and outreach to minority communities in its 10-K filing with the SEC made January 29, CNN previously reported.
    

            But not every business leader agrees. Mark Cuban, billionaire businessman and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, pushed back on Musk’s posts in a thread defending DEI as good for businesses and their workers.
    

            “The loss of DEI-Phobic companies is my gain,” Cuban wrote. “Having a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.”
    

            In April 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 7, known as the “Stop WOKE” bill into law. ﻿


            Texas, North Dakota, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah also have at least one anti-DEI bill that has been signed into law, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.


            In Nebraska, Republican State Sen. Dave Murman proposed a bill in January that would prohibit state colleges and universities from dedicating public money and staff time to DEI efforts.
    

            The bill is currently with the Nebraska legislature’s education committee, which will decide whether to move it to the full legislature.
    

             Murman’s office did not respond to a request for an interview.
    

            Nebraska Democratic state Sen. Danielle Conrad told CNN she opposes the bill, in part because the broader effort to ban DEI has become “divisive.” She said it also “distracts from the real issues” colleges are facing, such as families who can’t afford tuition.
    

            DEI, she said, is valuable to colleges and universities.
    

            “We absolutely know from common sense and research that when we have more diverse perspectives in discussion or as part of our education, it helps us to have more thoughtful results,” Conrad said. “It helps us to be more well-rounded, active and engaged citizens.”

CNN_7,Biden to deliver Oval Office address on decision not to seek reelection as Harris and Trump hit the trail,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/biden-oval-office-address-2024/index.html,2024-07-25 00:53:00,politics,"
President Joe Biden’s address to the nation Wednesday evening will serve not only to explain his shocking decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race but will carry an element of poignancy as he begins the closing chapter of his presidency and half-century in public service.
    

            He’s no longer the presumptive Democratic nominee trying to convince the nation that he still has the stamina and faculties to take on former President Donald Trump in an election in which he warned nothing less than democracy itself is in the balance. Instead, he’s now a lame-duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term in office. His speech at 8 p.m. ET will be his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and will serve as the first time many Americans see him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.
    

            The president intends to use the prime-time remarks to reveal to the American people how he arrived at the painful decision, sources told CNN, which he said in his letter Sunday he believed was “in the best interest of my party and the country.”
    

            Oval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements. It will be only the fourth time Biden has addressed the nation from the setting as president. And it’s the second time in just 10 days, following Biden’s remarks to the country earlier this month following the assassination attempt against Trump. He’s also used the setting to speak about Hamas’ attack on Israel last year and to laud the passage of a bipartisan budget agreement.

What happens in the Democratic nomination now that Biden has left the race


            Biden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for Covid-19, began drafting his highly anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN. Like all of Biden’s public speeches throughout his presidency, officials expect this address will be a work in progress up until delivery.
    

            How much Biden focuses on what he views as his core achievements of his three-and-a-half years in the office he sought for several decades — versus how much he details his to-do list for the six months before he leaves the White House — is still being decided, officials said.
    

            The president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden’s decision to step aside.)
    

            Harris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump. The former president will hold his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out in North Carolina on Wednesday. A CNN poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump, but it showed a closer contest than earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            As Harris visited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, Biden briefly called in, vowing “to get as much done as I possibly can” in his remaining time in office.
    

            And while the party moves on from Biden’s candidacy — reassigning high-profile fundraisers from coast to coast to the Harris camp — it is also trying to cement his legacy.
    

            The new CNN poll finds voters widely supportive of both Biden’s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden’s policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.
    

            Biden himself is expected to turn his attention in the coming days and weeks to the legacy of his one-term presidency. But, as one source told CNN, with the decision to drop out of the 2024 race only days old, such discussions have not begun in earnest.
    

            Asked by a reporter what the country should expect during his address as he disembarked Air Force One on Tuesday, Biden responded: “Watch and listen.”

CNN_8,Republicans stare down another funding failure as they head to recess,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/republicans-continuing-resolution-august-recess/index.html,2024-07-25 00:49:00,politics,"
            House Republicans are once again confronting a reality of their narrow majority: They are likely headed toward another stopgap spending bill when they return in September.
    

            “I would anticipate a CR until after the election,” Republican Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia told CNN, referencing such a stopgap measure known as a continuing resolution, or CR.
    

            Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, argues it’s the only option.
    

            “In September, they’ll be a continuing resolution,” DeLauro told CNN.
    

            Lost in the shuffle of a historic news cycle is the House GOP’s face plant on a series of spending bill over the last few weeks that leaves them in a very similar posture to last summer when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy struggled to pass even GOP-authored spending bills because of divisions within his ranks.
    

            Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who has worked to get all the bills out of his committee, told reporters Wednesday that he has been saying from the beginning the most likely outcome in September was always destined to be a stopgap measure.
    

            “I expected a CR,” he said.
    

            “We’d get as far down the process as we could go. We’ll see what the Senate can do,” Cole said. “We are where we’re at. They’ll be a CR.”
    

            This week alone, GOP leaders had to pull down two votes on spending bills from the schedule: financial services and agriculture. Then, on Tuesday night, as they attempted to pass a funding bill for energy and water, leaders had to pull the bill at the last minute because the votes weren’t expected to be there. This comes after a bill to fund the US Legislative Branch failed earlier this month and as leadership announced to members Wednesday morning they will go home early, meaning they won’t consider the remaining bills: Commerce Justice and Science, Labor, Health and Human Services or Housing before the August recess.
    

            Speaker Mike Johnson downplayed the decision about sending members home earlier being a sign they’d reached a stalemate in their spending process.
    

            “It’s not related to that,” Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, told reporters. “We’ve had a tumultuous couple of weeks in American politics, and everybody is, to be honest, still tired from our convention, and it’s just a good time to give everybody time to go home to their districts and campaign a little bit. We’ll come back and regroup.”
    

            He said that no decisions have been made about a stopgap spending bill.
    

            When they return, House lawmakers will have just a matter of weeks to act and, by then, focus will have to turn to making sure the government is funded with little time for Republicans to continue pursuing partisan bills, especially if they know the votes aren’t there anyway.
    

            The next fight conservatives are gearing up for is a push for how long that short-term spending bill goes. Some want to avoid a holiday crunch and are hoping to push the deadline for another spending bill to the spring.
    

            “I’m advocating for a CR that takes us into March,” GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, a member of the House Freedom Caucus told CNN. “So we don’t get jammed with a terrible (omnibus spending package), lame duck thing … it doesn’t matter if Trump wins or loses, we don’t want an omni jammed down our throats right before Christmas.”
    

            Cole argued that it will be up to the winner of the November presidential election to decide if they want to kick the can down the road for spending bill deadline, or have it dealt with in the lame duck so the decks are cleared when they come into office.
    

            “I would do it into November and get the deal done,” Cole said. “That would be my advice to whoever wins, but again, I recognize I don’t make that call, the incoming President will make that call.”
    

            The Senate for its part has not passed any of the 2025 appropriations bills on the floor. They have passed three in committee unanimously with bipartisan support, however.

CNN_9,What to know about the 25th Amendment and Joe Biden as Republicans allege a ‘cover-up’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/joe-biden-25th-amendment-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-25 03:37:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden’s planned address to the nation on Wednesday night will be an opportunity to explain his decision not to run for reelection and show he is still up to the task of serving as president – a job he has for nearly six more months, until January 20, 2025.
    

            No matter what Biden says or how much his fellow Democrats try to build up his accomplishments as president, multiple Republicans have argued that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution should be used to remove Biden from office ASAP.
    

            The idea that Biden is unfit to serve is in contrast to the Trump campaign’s argument that Biden should continue as the Democratic nominee; it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing Biden should not be able to transfer his campaign war chest to Vice President Kamala Harris.
    

            Even before Biden dropped out of the race, Rep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, filed a resolution in June after the president’s disastrous debate performance, calling on the 25th Amendment to be used against Biden.

Your questions about the post-Biden 2024 election, answered


            On the morning Biden dropped out of the race, House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Republicans have discussed how to investigate whether Democrats engaged in wrongdoing for arguing Biden is up to the job of being president.
    

            “They – the Democrats have been involved in a big cover-up here,” Johnson said.
    

            After Biden withdrew from the race, Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican, wrote letters to Harris and the Cabinet officials in the Biden administration, asking them to remove Biden from office.
    

            “If President Biden is unwilling to resign, for the sake of our great nation, you must do your duty to relieve him of his constitutional powers and duties,” Schmitt wrote in a letter sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and posted on Schmitt’s website.
    

            It’s hard to believe now that Republicans have reunified around Trump as their presidential candidate – and now that many of them doubt the severity of the January 6, 2021, insurrection – but use of the 25th Amendment was most recently seriously discussed with regard to Trump by his fellow Republicans that year.
    

Betsy DeVos, who was Trump’s secretary of education, confirmed to USA Today that she and other Trump Cabinet officials considered using the method to remove Trump from office. When it became clear to her that then-Vice President Mike Pence would not support the idea, she resigned from the Trump administration on January 7, 2021.
    

            “There were more than a few people who had those conversations internally,” she said.
    

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has since recommitted himself to Trump and developed some amnesia about the severity of the January 6 attack, can be heard on a January 8, 2021, recording obtained by New York Times reporters in which he says the 25th Amendment can’t be used against Trump because it “takes too long.”
    

            It is, indeed, a complicated process, as we first investigated back in January 2021.
    

            To forcibly wrest power from a sitting president, the vice president would have to be on board, according to the text of the amendment. Read the full language here.
    

            Harris, who has consistently praised Biden and has shown absolutely no indication she thinks Biden is unfit for office, would also need a majority of Biden’s Cabinet officials to agree the president is unfit for office and temporarily seize power from him. Like Harris, they have also expressed complete support for him finishing his term.
    

            In the extremely unlikely event Biden’s allies were to turn on him, Biden could dispute their move with a letter to Congress. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days to dispute him, after which Congress would be called on to vote – it requires a two-thirds supermajority, usually 67 senators and 290 House members, to permanently remove the president.
    

            Congress could also appoint its own body to review the president’s fitness instead of the Cabinet. In 2020, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill to create a congressional body for this purpose with regard to Trump, but it was not signed into law.
    

            No president has ever been removed from office in this way. The amendment was ratified in 1965, in the wake of the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, whose predecessor Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered major heart attacks. It was meant to create a clear line of succession and prepare for urgent contingencies.
    

            Eisenhower suffered a debilitating heart attack while in office in the 1950s. That was before the 25th Amendment, so there was no constitutional rule. Instead, he came to an agreement with then-Vice President Richard Nixon about handing over power.
    

            The portion of the 25th Amendment that allows the vice president and Cabinet to remove the president had in mind a leader who was in a coma or suffered a stroke.
    

            The Reagan administration drafted, but did not sign or transmit, letters to the Senate that would have taken power from Reagan after he was shot in 1981. You can see them at the Reagan Library’s website.

CNN_10,Vance’s selection solidifies Trump’s hold over the GOP,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/vance-trump-dominance-gop/index.html,2024-07-24 16:30:00,politics,"
            Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s selection as Donald Trump’s running mate has cemented the Republican Party’s reorientation away from the internationalist approach to the world that characterized it for the six decades before his rise.
    

            In his brief political career, Vance has embraced militantly isolationist, protectionist, and anti-immigration positions — the three critical elements of the defensive nationalism that Trump has stamped on the GOP. Trump’s pick reflects his confidence that he has subdued resistance in his party to his agenda for global affairs, which includes retreat from traditional alliances, soaring tariffs and severe measures against undocumented immigration, including mass deportations.
    

            “We don’t have any more mixed signals,” said Bill Kristol, a long-time conservative strategist turned Trump critic. “We now have Trump and a younger and more committed version of Trump. It’s just a decisive move toward America First on foreign policy.”
    

            Trump’s selection of Vance is one of the clearest barometers of the former president’s tightening hold over the GOP. In 2016, Trump felt compelled to choose as his vice president Mike Pence, who provided a bridge to an array of constituencies suspicious of the New York business executive at that point. Those included Christian conservatives, the business community, congressional insiders and traditional Republican foreign policy hawks shaped by Ronald Reagan’s vision of the US as the muscular leader of the free world.
    

            This time Trump felt impregnable enough inside the GOP to choose a running mate who doesn’t offer outreach to any of those groups (except, to some extent, social conservatives). Instead, with Vance, Trump chose an acolyte and potential successor who could deepen and extend the direction the former president has set for the party.
    

            While Trump in 2016 “needed to play the politician” in mollifying other Republican factions, “now Trump doesn’t need anyone in the party – he has conquered everyone,” said Geoffrey Kabaservice, director of political studies at the libertarian Niskanen Center and author of a history of moderate Republicans. “Even people who said terrible things about him have bent the knee. And he thinks anyone who has voted for any stripe of Republican has no choice but to go along with this new definition of what the Republican Party is.”
    

            The distance between that “new definition” and the GOP’s traditions before Trump may be the greatest in the intertwined issues revolving around America’s interactions with the world.
    

            Trump’s rise represents a kind of bookend to one of the most consequential moments in the GOP’s history. In the 1952 GOP primary, Dwight Eisenhower, who championed international alliances and close ties with Europe to contain the Soviet Union, defeated Sen. Robert Taft, who was skeptical of all those ideas.
    

            Eisenhower’s victory over Taft proved a turning point. As I’ve written, “Every Republican presidential nominee over the next six decades – a list that extended from Richard Nixon through Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney – identified more with the internationalist than isolationist wing of the party.”
    

            Isolationism reminiscent of Taft, joined with protectionism and nativism, first resurfaced as a force in the GOP with Patrick J. Buchanan’s two presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996. But it wasn’t until Trump’s ascent in 2016 that a candidate who departed from the party’s internationalist consensus claimed the nomination.
    

            In office, Trump moved away from the GOP’s traditional free trade stance, imposing 25% tariffs on an array of foreign imports (not only from China but also Europe and even Canada) and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement started under George H.W. Bush. He pursued hard-edged policies to restrict undocumented immigration (including building miles of border wall and separating migrant children from their parents at the border). And he expressed deep skepticism about the value of America’s traditional alliances in Europe and Asia: John Bolton, who served as his national security adviser at the time, has said publicly that he feared Trump was on the brink of quitting NATO at a 2018 meeting of the alliance.
    

            One senior national security official in Trump’s first term, who asked for anonymity to candidly describe direct conversations with him, told me that the ex-president fundamentally did not accept the dominant view in both parties since World War II that the US benefited from having friendly allies cooperating in a rules-based international system.
    

            “He wouldn’t see that keeping Europe safe and free is in our security interests, let alone our economic ones,” the official said. “He simply can’t get beyond the fact that many of our allies are not contributing their fair share to our collective security, whether it is in Europe or Asia.”
    

            While Trump faced relatively little internal resistance over his hardline policies on trade and immigration, his determination to retreat from international alliances was limited by opposition from many of his senior national security officials, who had roots in the party’s Reaganite internationalist traditions. Those included national security advisers Bolton and H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretaries James Mattis and Mark Esper, and Secretaries of State Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.
    

            To many observers, Trump’s selection of Vance sent an unmistakable signal that the former president no longer feels compelled to defer to such voices. “If you had any hope that a second Trump administration might be persuaded to have a more balanced policy towards Europe, and particularly Ukraine, that hope was dashed by the pick of Vance,” said Ivo Daalder, CEO of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and US ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.
    

            The GOP’s internationalist wing is still substantial in the Senate, noted Richard Fontaine, the former foreign policy adviser to the late Republican Sen. John McCain and now the CEO of the Center for a New American Security, a centrist thinktank. But they would have very limited levers to compel Trump to play a more engaged international role, he said.
    

            While Congress can try to restrain a “maximalist” president pursuing an expansive foreign policy agenda, Fontaine said, there’s little it can do to force action from a president “closer to a minimalist” in his view about American commitments. With an eye on a possible second Trump presidency, Congress has passed legislation preventing a future president from formally quitting NATO without legislative approval. But if Trump simply refuses to dispatch US troops to repel a future Russian attack, “there is no one who can compel him to defend NATO allies,” said Fontaine, co-author of the new book, “Lost Decade: The US Pivot to Asia and the Rise of Chinese Power.”
    

            In Vance, Trump has picked a running mate and governing partner likely to nudge his boss further toward a retreat from the world. “Vance is the real deal: He is a mini-Trump and he will reinforce Trump’s instincts,” said Matthias Matthijs, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins’ School of Advanced International Studies. “This is America alone, draw up the drawbridge.”
    

            Since entering politics, Vance has been a full-throated supporter of each element of Trump’s defensive nationalism. Vance’s first campaign ad in his 2022 Senate race highlighted his support for Trump’s border wall and forcefully rejected the idea that hostility to undocumented immigration was racist. In the Senate, Vance has backed trade restrictions and, in one of his first interviews after his nomination for vice president, the Ohio Republican unreservedly seconded Trump’s skepticism of traditional free trade agreements. “NAFTA destroyed the manufacturing economy in Pennsylvania and Michigan, a real estate developer from New York, Donald Trump was actually right about that issue,” Vance told Fox News.
    

            Vance has been most unequivocal in criticizing the internationalist approach to foreign policy centered on robust alliances. He has been among the most unbending Republican opponents of continued aid to Ukraine; although larger numbers of Republican senators opposed earlier versions of the aid, Vance was one of just 15 GOP senators who voted against the final $95 billion package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan this spring.
    

            “I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another,” Vance told Steve Bannon in an interview soon after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. “I’m sick of Joe Biden focusing on the border of a country I don’t care about while he lets the border of his own country become a total war zone.”
    

            Later in a debate on the Senate floor, Vance issued a sweeping denunciation of the nation’s internationalist tradition that linked America’s assistance to Ukraine to the nation’s frustrating interventions in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.
    

            “The bipartisan consensus in American foreign policy has led to effectively graveyard after graveyard after graveyard, [and] $34 trillion in debt,” Vance declared. “We have purchased on the backs of our children and grandchildren a number of graveyards all across the world.”
    

            To the beleaguered Republicans upholding the party’s internationalist banner, Vance’s selection was an ominous portent. “They are celebrating that choice both in Milwaukee tonight and in Moscow,” former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said after Trump announced the selection last week while Republicans were gathered in Wisconsin for the convention. Likewise, Bolton said of Vance and Trump: “The bottom line is these are candidates who do not fundamentally understand that a strong American presence in the world is good for us here at home.”
    

            But while the remaining Reaganite internationalists in the GOP were disappointed by Vance’s selection, they could not have been surprised. On each of the key elements of defensive nationalism, Trump has indicated that he intends to push much further in a second term than he did in a first.
    

            On immigration, beyond completing his border wall and requiring asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” while their cases are adjudicated, Trump has pledged to deport an unprecedented number of undocumented immigrants already living in the US, complete with detention camps and use of the National Guard to round up deportees.
    

            On trade, Trump has moved far beyond his first-term actions to promise sweeping tariffs of 10% on all imports and additional levies of 60% or more on products from China. He’s openly mused that he might seek to fundamentally reorient the federal budget by raising tariffs high enough to replace the federal income tax – which budget experts point out is a mathematical impossibility.


            Trump’s skepticism of international alliances remains undiminished. In one of the campaign videos he’s used to sketch out a second term agenda, Trump says that if reelected, he would “finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally reevaluating NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission.” Policy analysts at the Center for Renewing America, a thinktank attempting to define a Trump second term agenda, have sketched plans for what they call a “Dormant NATO,” with the US technically still within the alliance but reduced to a minimal role.
    

In an interview with Businessweek published last week, Trump even cast doubt on whether he would defend Taiwan from an invasion by China — a commitment that has been a deliberately ambiguous, but enduring, pillar of American foreign policy. (Biden on multiple occasions has explicitly pledged to defend the island.) Trump cited the logistical challenges involved (“Taiwan is 9,500 miles away,” he said. “It’s 68 miles away from China”), but also raised philosophical objections to defending Taiwan. After complaining that Taiwan “did take about 100%” of the US semiconductor business, Trump insisted, “I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company.”
    

            Trump’s skepticism about defending Taiwan placed him even further on the isolationist spectrum than Vance. Like Taft and other GOP isolationists in the 1940s and 1950s, Vance has argued for reducing US involvement in Europe to free resources to confront China in Asia. Fontaine said all evidence suggests Trump doesn’t view China much differently than any other country, including long-standing allies, that he believes “have taken advantage of us for a long time.”
    

            Trump, though, does share his running mate’s desire to decouple from Europe. Beyond Trump’s general suspicion of NATO, that instinct will likely be felt most immediately in an effort to force Ukraine to reach a negotiated settlement that requires Kyiv to make significant territorial concessions to Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Vance has publicly called for such a deal on multiple occasions.)
    

            A reelected Trump would likely pressure Ukraine by threatening to cut off arms shipments if it doesn’t reach an agreement. But Daalder, like other experts, believes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would resist such pressure and fight on. The idea that a Trump administration could “deliver a peace that no one else can is a figment of their imagination,” Daalder said. “The reality is the Ukrainians will fight until the very, very bitter end in order to defend themselves, and they are not going to listen to Donald Trump or J.D. Vance about whether that continues.”
    

            Matthijs believes Putin might be equally resistant to a negotiated settlement. “I think he wants it all still,” Matthijs said. “He wants Trump eventually to say ‘I don’t care,’ and is betting on the fact that the Europeans will eventually fall apart over it.”
    

            A reelected Trump who denies or diminishes aid to Ukraine, but cannot force an end to the fighting, might expose himself to grave political risk, two right-leaning foreign policy analysts recently argued in an article for The Bulwark, an online publication published by conservatives critical of Trump.
    

            “The fall of Kabul and Afghanistan to the Taliban in the summer of 2021 was an ugly disaster for the Biden presidency, one for which it has been rightly excoriated,” wrote Aaron Friedberg and Gabriel Schoenfeld. “The fall of Kyiv and Ukraine to the Russians, if Trump and Vance have their way, has the potential to be far uglier. … Unlike in Afghanistan, the horror show will unfold on television in the heart of Europe.”
    

            That prospect is only one of the political risks Trump’s defensive nationalism could pose. Economic forecasters have projected that the combination of Trump’s sweeping tariffs and mass deportations could reignite inflation. And while polls show substantial support today for mass deportation, many are skeptical that would endure once Americans see images of mothers and children being rounded up, or held in detention camps.
    

            The more fundamental challenge is that Trump’s skepticism of US international commitment strains the central fault line between Republican-leaning voters with and without a college degree. A national survey by the Chicago Council last year found support for a robust US international role among Republicans has fallen to a nearly 50-year low; but support for engagement and alliances remained strongest among GOP-leaning voters with at least a four-year college degree. Those were the same white-collar suburban voters that provided the core of support in this year’s GOP primary for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who unreservedly articulated the Reagan-era view of American international leadership.
    

            Alone, differing views on America’s relations with the world may not be enough to peel many of those Haley-type voters away from Trump this fall. But their unease about abandoning Ukraine (and/or Taiwan), imposing prohibitive tariffs on imports and deporting millions of people, might provide Democrats openings among them, particularly when combined with their discomfort with Trump’s belligerent style, and the party’s overall shift right on social issues.
    

            With the selection of Vance, Trump has broadcast his belief that he has conclusively won the internal GOP debate over all aspects of US interactions with the world – foreign policy, immigration and trade. The remaining question is whether that internal victory is liberating Trump to pursue policies that will ultimately cost him with a broader audience of Americans, either in the campaign or a second presidential term.

            The 920-page Project 2025 blueprint was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration; Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.” Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism.
    

            At Harris’ Tuesday rally in Wisconsin, she criticized Trump and “his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” then said: “Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It’s 900 pages. But here’s the thing. When you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.”
    

Facts First: One of Harris’ claims about Project 2025 is false, while another is at least misleading. The Project 2025 document does not show that Trump intends to cut Social Security; the document barely discusses Social Security at all and does not propose cuts to the program. In addition, contrary to Harris’ suggestion, Project 2025 does not call to “end” the Affordable Care Act or eliminate its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The document does criticize the Affordable Care Act, especially the law’s expansion of Medicaid, but makes clear it is advocating changes to the law rather than terminating the law entirely.


            A Harris campaign official said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”  


            Mary Vought, a spokesperson for Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation, said, “Harris should follow her own advice and read the book instead of promoting lies and misinformation.”
    

No Project 2025 call to cut Social Security


            We won’t render a verdict on Harris’ claim about Project 2025 calling for cuts to Medicare, though Trump himself has vowed he will not cut even a cent from the health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities. The Project 2025 document proposes multiple significant changes to Medicare, and it’s not clear what their overall impact would be.
    

            And there is a reasonable basis for Harris’ claim about Project 2025 wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. The project’s proposals to significantly restructure the tax code include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate and ideas that would disproportionately benefit high earners. Trump’s own proposal to extend the expiring provisions of his 2017 tax cut law also favors wealthy people.
    

            But contrary to Harris’ claim that “when you read” the Project 2025 document “you will see” that Trump intends to cut Social Security, the lengthy document includes no call to cut Social Security. In fact, the document uses the words “Social Security” just 10 times, mostly in passing. Vought said the document calls for “no changes to Social Security.”
    

            Harris could fairly have noted that Trump himself has expressed openness, both in decades past and earlier this year, to cutting Social Security. When he was asked in a March interview about how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, he said, “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements.” (He has since vowed not to cut “one penny” from Social Security or Medicare.)
    

            But what Harris actually said is that the proof of a supposed Trump intention to cut Social Security in a second term is found in the Project 2025 document. It is not.
    

No Project 2025 call to end the Affordable Care Act


            Harris at least suggested at the rally, though did not explicitly say, that the Project 2025 document includes a call to end the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But that’s not correct, either.
    

            The document criticizes the budget impact of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for lower-income people. It also explicitly calls for some changes to the Affordable Care Act – popularly known as Obamacare – or its implementation. Those suggested changes include removing restrictions on physician-owned and specialty hospitals, better enforcing a provision of the law related to how insurers must handle money related to abortion, and coming up with “a plan to separate the non-subsidized insurance market from the subsidized market.”
    

            But the document makes no mention of changes to Affordable Care Act protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And its suggestions for changes to the law are clearly not suggestions to get rid of the law entirely. “It does not end the Affordable Care Act,” Vought said.
    

            Trump himself repeatedly promised during his 2016 election campaign to “terminate” Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified superior plan, but failed to achieve his goal as president. In a social media post during this campaign, in November 2023, he said he was “seriously looking at alternatives” to Obamacare, criticized Republican senators who had voted “not to terminate” the law, and added that “we should never give up!”
    

            Then, four days later, he wrote, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!”

CNN_12,CNN Poll: Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump in early look at new matchup,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/cnn-poll-kamala-harris-donald-trump/index.html,2024-07-25 00:01:00,politics,"
            The likely 2024 presidential election campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump begins with no clear leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS after President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection.
    

            Trump holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. That’s a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found on the matchup between Biden and Trump.
    

            The survey finds voters widely supportive of both Biden’s decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are broadly enthusiastic about Harris and willing to coalesce around her as the new presumptive nominee, even as they remain deeply divided on whether Biden’s Democratic successor should seek to continue his policies or chart a new course.
    

            The poll, conducted online July 22 and 23, surveyed registered voters who had previously participated in CNN surveys in April or June, both of which found Trump leading Biden by 6 points in a head-to-head matchup. Checking back in with the same people means that shifts in preferences are more likely to reflect real changes over time and not just statistical noise.
    

            And the new poll finds some critical movement in these early days of a Harris-Trump race.
    

            Harris hangs on to 95% of those who earlier said they supported Biden, while Trump retains the support of a slightly smaller 92% of his previous backers. Those who previously said they would support neither Biden nor Trump in a two-way matchup now split 30% for Harris and 27% for Trump, with the rest saying they’d vote for someone else or opt out of this year’s election.

Polling suggests Harris might be able to outperform Biden against Trump among these groups


            Half of those who back Harris in the new poll (50%) say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump. That’s a dramatic shift compared with the Trump-focused dynamic of the Biden-Trump race. Among Biden’s supporters in CNN’s June poll, just 37% said their vote was mainly to express support for the president.
    

            About three-quarters of Trump’s supporters (74%) say their vote is to express support for him rather than opposition to Harris. That’s an increase in affirmative support for him compared with the June CNN poll (66%), which came before an assassination attempt on Trump’s life and the Republican National Convention at which the former president formally accepted his party’s nomination. The poll finds Trump’s favorability rating ticking up to 43%, higher than it’s been since 2020 in CNN polling.
    

            The poll also suggests that Trump’s support among his strongest groups is holding steady even as his opponent changes: 67% of White voters without degrees support him over Harris, near-identical to his support against Biden (66%). He continues to hold the support of a majority of men (53% versus Harris, it was 54% against Biden). And he maintains the support of about 9 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (90% vs. Harris, 89% against Biden).
    

            The shift toward affirmative support for Harris among her backers comes from groups that typically break for Democrats but had been seen as trouble spots for the Biden campaign. Among Harris supporters younger than 45, 43% say their vote is more in support of her than against Trump, up from 28% of Biden voters in that age group who felt the same way about the president in June. Among voters of color who back Harris, 57% say their vote is for her more than against Trump, compared with 48% among Biden voters of color in June. And 54% of women backing Harris say their vote is to support her, compared with 43% of women backing Biden who said the same in June.
    

            Those same groups account at least in part for Harris’ polling gains over Biden among those who were recontacted for this survey.
    

            Among voters under 35, 49% said in April or June that they would support Trump and 42% Biden, but now, 47% support Harris to 43% for Trump. The same Black voters who split 70% for Biden to 23% for Trump in previous polling now break 78% for Harris to 15% for Trump. Among Hispanic voters, Biden trailed Trump in earlier polling 50% to 41%; those same voters now split about evenly, 47% Harris to 45% for Trump. Women split 46% Biden to 46% Trump in earlier polling, but now break 50% Harris to 45% Trump.
    

            Independent voters who broke 47% Trump to 37% Biden in prior polls now split 46% Trump to 43% Harris. That narrowed gap is driven at least partly by increased Harris support among independents who lean toward the Democratic Party. While 81% of voters in that group supported Biden in April or June, 90% of them now back Harris.
    

            The poll was conducted as Democratic politicians and delegates rapidly rallied around Harris as the party’s presumptive nominee in the days following Biden’s decision to exit the race. About three-quarters of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters (76%) say the Democratic Party should nominate Harris as its candidate for president, with only about 6% expressing support for any other specific person as the nominee.
    

            Democratic-aligned voters express broadly positive views of Harris, with three-quarters or more saying that she is someone they’d be proud to have as president (86%), agrees with them on the issues that matter most (84%), represents the future of the Democratic Party (83%), will unite the country and not divide it (77%) and has a good chance of beating Trump (75%).

            In a sign of the current intraparty unity around Harris, there are relatively few sharp demographic divides in Democratic-aligned voters’ assessments. Ideological divisions within the Democratic Party are also relatively muted, with both 88% of self-described liberals and 81% of self-described moderates or conservatives saying that they think Harris agrees with them on the most important issues.
    

            But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden’s policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.
    

            Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, voters older than 65 (72%), White voters (62%) and those with college degrees (58%) largely want the party’s next nominee to follow in Biden’s footsteps. Six in 10 voters of color and voters younger than 45 say they’re looking for a new direction on policy.
    

            By contrast, there’s little ideological divide on this question, with similar shares of self-described liberals (55%) and moderates or conservatives (51%) hoping to see the next nominee continue with Biden’s policies.
    

            Democratic-aligned voters’ priorities for a potential Harris running mate suggest a focus on electability: Four in 10 say it’s extremely important that, if nominated, she choose someone with proven appeal to swing voters. That’s in contrast to under 3 in 10 who say it’s extremely important that her running mate bring ideological balance to the ticket (28%) or has experience as an executive in government (25%).
    

            Only 11% say it’s extremely important she pick a male running mate, with more than half saying that isn’t at all an important factor.
    

            The poll suggests Republican and Republican-leaning voters have also coalesced around Trump in the tumultuous weeks since the June 27 CNN presidential debate. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) now say that the Republicans have a better chance to win with Trump at the top of the ticket than without him, the highest share to say so in any CNN poll on this question dating back to 2015.
    

            Nearly 9 in 10 registered voters overall (87%) say they approve of Biden’s decision to end his campaign for reelection, including more than 8 in 10 across parties (90% of Democrats, 88% of independents and 85% of Republicans approve). And 70% – including majorities across party lines – say that he should remain in office as president through the end of his term in January, while 29% say he ought to resign and let Harris take over.
    

            Asked how they feel about Biden stepping aside, 58% of voters nationwide say they feel relieved, 37% are hopeful, 28% say they were surprised and 20% are worried. Smaller shares say they felt disappointed (13%) or angry (4%).
    

            Black voters are somewhat less likely than voters overall to approve of Biden’s decision (78% approve) and more likely to say they were surprised (49%) or feel disappointed about his choice (27%).
    

            Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, 54% say they feel hopeful, while 29% are worried. Just 2% of Democratic-aligned voters say they feel angry.
    

            The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from July 22-23 among a random national sample of 1,631 registered voters who participated in CNN polls in April or June and were originally drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. More than 80% of registered voters across the two initial surveys participated in the recontact survey, and analysis showed no meaningful difference in demographic characteristics or political views between those who participated and those who did not. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.0 percentage points.

CNN_13,Progressive House Democrats plan counter-programming to Netanyahu visit,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/house-progressives-counter-programming-netanyahu/index.html,2024-07-24 20:56:00,politics,"
            A number of Democratic lawmakers are planning to participate in a series of counter-programming events on Wednesday instead of attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, the latest example of how Democrats remain divided over Israel’s handling of its war with Hamas.
    

            At the same time Netanyahu is expected to address Congress, a variety of progressive nonprofit groups are hosting an event in the Capitol that multiple Democratic lawmakers are expected to attend, according to an invitation shared with CNN.
    

            The event, “Peace is Possible: An Alternative Vision for Israel and Palestine,” will feature Israeli and Palestinian peace leaders and is hosted by groups like the Center for American Progress and Middle East Democracy Center.
    

            Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, is expected to deliver opening remarks at the event, according to an advisory shared with CNN.

            Meanwhile, Democratic Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Greg Casar of Texas will host a Zoom news conference with a coalition of progressives to try and pressure the Biden administration and Congress to adopt an arms embargo against Israel as activists argue that supplying weapons to Israel creates human rights violations.
    

            Separately, senior House Democrats including Reps. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Jamie Raskin of Maryland will meet with the families of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas terror attack.
    

            Approximately 80 House Democrats and at least six Democratic senators are expected to skip Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday, according to sources and public statements reviewed by CNN. House Democratic leadership has given their members room to make their own decisions about whether to attend the speech.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, will not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, and she is expected to meet separately with Netanyahu later this week. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech, leaving Senate Foreign Relations Chair Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, to preside, a source familiar told CNN.
    

            Ahead of Netanyahu’s address, House Speaker Mike Johnson sent a letter to lawmakers obtained by CNN informing lawmakers that there will be “an increased police presence around the Capitol complex and in the House Chamber” and emphasized that there will be a “zero-tolerance policy for disturbances in the building.”
    

            In a scathing statement, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, called Netanyahu “a war criminal committing genocide against the Palestinian people.” Tlaib’s statement did not say whether she would attend the speech.
    

            “It is utterly disgraceful that leaders from both parties have invited him to address Congress. He should be arrested and sent to the International Criminal Court,” Tlaib added.
    

            Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, another one of the lawmakers to skip Netanyahu’s speech, told CNN, “I just don’t think we should be listening to a one-way lecture from Netanyahu when he’s had a failed strategy on the board.”
    

            Even some Jewish lawmakers like Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of California are not planning on attending.
    

            “I’m not attending the Netanyahu address because I don’t want to condone his behavior over the last 10 months,” Jacobs told CNN. “I think Israel’s security is incredibly important. I have family who live there. But what Netanyahu has done, how he has prosecuted this war, what he has been doing in the West Bank does not actually make Israel any safer.”
    

            Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told CNN that instead of attending the address, she gave her tickets to family members of the hostages being held.

            “This is a war criminal that nobody, not a single one of our elected officials should be meeting with Netanyahu,” JVP communications director Sonya Meyerson-Knox told CNN. “And in fact, what we are demanding from our elected officials is to actually do everything they can to get to a ceasefire to save lives.”
    

            House Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee’s office had to call US Capitol Police for help after protestors swarmed his office, which resulted in several arrests.
    

            “Hundreds of protesters outside the office became disruptive, violently beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force entry into the office,” Kildee’s chief of staff, Mitchell Rivard, said in a statement to CNN. “The U.S. Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms responded immediately to the incident and have made several arrests. Congressman Kildee is safe and his staff are all accounted for.”
    

            Capitol Police are preparing for a large coalition protest led by Palestinian groups to surround the Capitol on Wednesday in anticipation of Netanyahu’s arrival.

CNN_14,Harris’ immigration work comes under scrutiny as campaign takes shape,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/harris-immigration-work-gop-attacks/index.html,2024-07-24 20:44:00,politics,"
            As a border crisis unfolded only months into Joe Biden’s presidency, he looked to his vice president to help solve an intractable issue: migration.
    

            It seemed like a no-win political assignment. Vice President Kamala Harris and her staff quickly sought to make one thing clear: She wasn’t charged with managing the southern border.
    

            Three years later, that task looms over Harris’ unprecedented campaign for the White House, becoming a central line of attack from Republicans.
    

            “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” former President Donald Trump said in a rare call with reporters Tuesday, falsely claiming Harris had been appointed Biden’s “border czar.”
    

            The management of the US-Mexico border has been a political liability for Biden, and it will now follow Harris as Trump makes it a cornerstone of his campaign.
    

            Over the last three years, an unprecedented number of border crossings have come to define the administration’s immigration record — recently resulting in the White House taking an aggressive measure to dramatically clamp down on asylum at the US southern border.

How the House GOP campaign arm is pivoting to target Harris: Border, fracking and protests


            As the vice president’s campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that’s been bundled with the administration’s larger migration issues.
    

            In the first rally of her 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday, Harris didn’t mention border security. The issue has generally not been featured prominently at campaign rallies over the last year, but both Harris and Biden have recently cited the bipartisan immigration deal that was scuttled by Trump to make the case that Republicans aren’t serious about border security.
    

            The House GOP campaign arm is also encouraging lawmakers to focus on what it describes as Harris’ failed border policies, according to a memo obtained by CNN.
    

            In a statement, Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Harris’ presidential campaign, cast Trump’s immigration policies as “xenophobic” and blamed Trump for dysfunction at the border.
    

            “The only ‘plan’ Donald Trump has to secure our border is ripping mothers from their children and a few xenophobic placards at the Republican National Convention,” Munoz said. “He tanked the toughest bipartisan border security deal in a generation because for Donald Trump, this has never been about actually securing the border – it’s always about himself. He can make up whatever lies he wants but the fact is there’s only one candidate in this race who will fight for real solutions to help secure our nation’s border, and that’s Vice President Harris.”
    

            Harris’ root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America, seeing the assignment as a sign of respect, having done the same job himself under former President Barack Obama.
    

            While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
    

            At the time, most minors apprehended at the US southern border were from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — a region that was hard-hit by major hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic and that had been a main source of migration over the last decade.
    

            As the vice president’s team began strategizing, the problem facing the administration grew. Seven months later, it was migrants arriving from even farther away in South America — outside of Harris’ assigned portfolio — who were overwhelming the Biden administration.
    

            Border crossings surged, and Republicans pointed their fingers at the vice president, dubbing Harris the “border czar,” a title the White House rejected, arguing that her focus was on the region and not on border security. And in 2022, as an affront to Harris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, began busing migrants to her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC.
    

            Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California on Tuesday called efforts by House Republicans to paint Harris as a border czar “laughable and unserious.”
    

            “Let’s be very clear, there was no ‘border czar.’ Kamala Harris’ role was to engage in multilateral discussion with our Latin American countries,” the House Democratic Caucus chair told reporters.

Harris makes first trip to battleground Wisconsin since launching presidential campaign


            Harris has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden.
    

            And it’s the comments she made early on that will likely be used by Republicans in the months to come.
    

            In an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in June 2021, roughly five months after taking office, Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn’t yet visited the US-Mexico border.
    

            “At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” the vice president said. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole … thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.”
    

            Holt responded: “You haven’t been to the border.”
    

            “And I haven’t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t — I don’t understand the point that you’re making,” Harris said with a laugh. She added: “I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”
    

            Later that month, Harris visited the border.
    

            White House officials quickly worked to get Harris up to speed after she was assigned to tackle the root causes of migration.
    

            Officials pulled together a series of memos examining what Biden had done when he was vice president and held a similar role, analyzing what worked and what could be done better, according to a former senior administration official.
    

            In some ways, the region had already been familiar territory for Harris, dating to her days as California’s attorney general.
    

            “In terms of the root causes piece as VP, there’s a through line in her work as AG starting to build relationships in Mexico and Central America,” said Daniel Suvor, former chief of policy to then-Attorney General Harris and now partner at O’Melveny & Myers, arguing that her work has often focused on concrete, measurable outcomes.
    

            Officials met daily, briefing the vice president along the way, with another former senior administration official describing the process as “intense” amid a worsening crisis at the border.
    

            “She ultimately studied that and put her own stamp on it, which was the private-sector component,” one of the former senior administration officials said, noting that was an area they concluded Biden, as vice president, didn’t have time to fully develop.

Analysis: Harris gets a dream start, but the task ahead is monumental


            Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region.
    

            Earlier this year, Harris met with President Bernardo Arévalo of Guatemala to strengthen the US-Guatemala bilateral relationship and discuss good governance, economic opportunity, security and migration management, according to a White House readout.
    

            Around 56 companies are collaborating across financial services, textiles and apparel, agriculture, technology, telecommunications, and nonprofit sectors to bolster the region’s economy. Together, they’ve invested more than $5 billion.
    

            Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments.
    

            Honduran Minister of Investment Miguel Medina argued that having the White House behind the initiative has been instrumental in bringing big companies and private-sector money into the region.
    

            “The difference with the partnership is that the facilitating that they’ve been doing, and they continue to do, that facilitating is not something that is accessible to a normal company in Honduras,” he said, citing, for example, work with Nespresso to purchase and sell coffee beans.
    

            “If it wasn’t for this being moved from the White House, there’s … no way we could have had the success that it’s had,” Medina added.
    

            While it’s difficult to measure the direct impact on migration, US Customs and Border Protection has seen a considerable drop in migrants arriving at the southern border from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to federal data.
    

            “For the long term, she certainly can claim credit for having started off efforts to improve people’s lives in Central America,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.

CNN_15,Trump reemerges in North Carolina to a new opponent and a political landscape reshaped once again by the extraordinary,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donald-trump-rally-north-carolina/index.html,2024-07-24 16:00:00,politics,"
Donald Trump will step out onto the campaign trail Wednesday to an entirely new race and a political landscape once again irrevocably altered by an unprecedented election year.
    

            The former president’s rally here is his first since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid Sunday, setting off a chain of events that appears destined to end with Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris in November.
    

            Biden’s decision and Harris’ elevation has sent a surge of adrenaline through the Democratic Party and unleashed a wave of new donations to compete with Trump’s own strengthened financial position. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are working to reimagine a playbook and operation launched to take on an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent.
    

            In a campaign already marked by extraordinary events – a significant civil judgment against Trump, a felony conviction, an indictment dismissed and another delayed by a scandal in the Georgia prosecutor’s office, Biden’s confidence-shattering debate performance and an assassination attempt on the former president – the latest twist has plunged the presidential race deeper into uncharted territory.
    

            Trump spent Tuesday reacting to his changed political fortunes. In a barrage of social media posts, the former president ripped into his likely new opponent, lamented that Republicans were forced “to waste a great deal of time and money” prior to the Democratic shake-up, suggested that the “Biden/Harris administration” was to blame for the assassination attempt on his life, criticized Democratic tributes to Biden (“He was pushed out of power like a dog,” the former president wrote) and ripped Fox News for giving airtime to the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a state Trump is targeting.

            “They make me fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight!” Trump said of the network.
    

            Later, Trump held a call with reporters – the first of its kind this cycle – during which he tested new attack lines against Harris.
    

            “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Trump, who has spent the past 19 months attacking Biden over the border while rarely mentioning Harris.
    

            The Democratic National Committee responded to the stepped-up attacks on Harris over immigration by highlighting Trump’s successful effort to kill a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year.
    

            Trump’s team insists it was prepared for a change at the top of the Democratic ticket long before Biden officially dropped out, pointing to an internal memo from May laying out scenarios that would result in an open convention and another Democrat as the nominee.
    

            Senior Trump advisers continue to suggest that a campaign against Harris would largely center on the same issues once used to criticize Biden: crime, immigration and inflation. As Biden’s second in command, Harris played a key role in shaping the administration’s approaches to those topics, they will argue.
    

            However, some individuals close to Trump acknowledge the uncertainty brought on by Harris’ candidacy, specifically what new Democratic enthusiasm could mean for turnout in November.
    

            Already, Trump’s campaign is bracing for the fresh excitement over Harris to generate a bump for her in the polls, as laid out in an expectation-setting memo Tuesday from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio. He predicted that Harris would start “gaining on or even leading President Trump” in the polls, though he also insisted that the “honeymoon” period would end.
    

            Trump’s team faces a race against the clock to define Harris before she can fully turn the Biden election machine into her own campaign. Though polls suggest Harris is a recognizable figure, the Trump campaign remains convinced that the public doesn’t know much about her – referring to the gap as “name education.” The campaign intends to spend the coming weeks trying to fill that knowledge void with as much negative information about Harris as it can.
    

            Fabrizio in his memo previewed what the Trump campaign is expected to attack: Harris’ record in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general; her tie-breaking vote as vice president on the Inflation Reduction Act, a law Biden championed to boost investments to reverse climate change; and her response to the rise in migrant border crossings.

            A source close to Trump also indicated that the campaign and its allies are planning to specifically highlight certain choices she made as San Francisco district attorney in an attempt to portray her as lenient on violent criminals.
    

            “So, while the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’ done,” Fabrizio wrote.
    

            The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, showcasing another plan of attack. The ad says Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline” and features a clip of her praising Biden’s performance as president. “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done,” Harris says in the clip.
    

            The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
    

            Trump’s appearance in Charlotte will provide his first opportunity to contrast himself with Harris before voters in a battleground state. Four years ago, North Carolina produced Trump’s narrowest margin of statewide victory, and it was expected to be a top battleground again in 2024. But it was left off the list of states that the Biden campaign viewed as most winnable in a sobering post-debate assessment of the race.

CNN_16,‘Her extraordinary origin story could help expand the base’: Diverse donors race to help Harris make history,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donors-kamala-harris-diverse/index.html,2024-07-24 12:00:00,politics,"
Kamala Harris stands on the threshold of history.
    

            If elected to succeed President Joe Biden, Harris – the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother – would not only be the first woman, but the first Indian American, the first Asian, the first Black woman and the first person of Jamaican descent to ascend to the office.
    

            And Democratic-aligned donors from all those worlds are eager to help Harris get there.
    

            “Her multiple identities is actually her superpower in this moment,” said Glynda Carr, the CEO of Higher Heights for America, a group focused on growing Black women’s political power.
    

            Carr, like Harris, is a part of the storied Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., whose members swiftly donated checks in amounts of $19.08 to Biden’s campaign in 2020 to signal their approval of his vice-presidential pick. That figure marks the year of the sorority’s founding at Harris’ alma mater, Howard University.
    

            Her sorority sisters are messaging with their money once again: More than 1,500 contributions of exactly $19.08 each have hit the campaign’s accounts between Sunday afternoon – when Biden exited the 2024 presidential race – and Monday evening, according to a source familiar with Harris’ fundraising.
    

            Carr suspects that “all the founding dates” of the Divine Nine – as the country’s historically African American sororities and fraternities are known – will be represented on checks this year.
    

            Political fundraisers around the country say they’ve witnessed a breathtaking financial turnaround for Democrats since Biden’s withdrawal effectively ended a donor blockade in the aftermath of the president’s poor debate performance last month.
    

            Harris’ campaign said it had collected a staggering $100 million between Sunday and Monday evening across all its fundraising committees – far surpassing the $53 million that Trump’s political operation touted raising after his May conviction in a Manhattan business fraud case. More than 1.1 million donors have contributed – with 62% of them first-time givers this cycle, Harris’ campaign said.
    

            Alexandra Acker-Lyons, a Democratic donor adviser based in Denver, said she began her outreach to her network of women donors last Thursday as it became increasingly apparent that the turmoil around Biden’s continued candidacy would not let up. The floodgates are now open, she said.
    

            Contributors are “just overwhelmingly excited” by Harris’ candidacy, said Acker-Lyons, who also serves as political director of the Electing Women Alliance, a network of political giving circles focused on supporting female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights.
    

            “One donor said, ‘I didn’t have unbridled joy on my bingo card for 2024,’” she said.
    

            It’s not just women who are exulting at Harris’ rise.
    

            Her ascent in national politics underscores that “as a community, we really have arrived in the United States,” said Ramesh Kapur, an Indian-American businessman and veteran Democratic bundler.
    

            He said he held his first fundraiser for Harris at his Boston-area home during her successful 2016 Senate campaign. Now, Kapur is working to rally other people of Indian heritage to open their checkbooks for the roughly three-month sprint to Election Day.
    

            “I’m really excited about her because she’s my DNA,” he said.
    

            In Virginia, meanwhile, Shekar Narasimhan – an investment banker and chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund political action committee – said a broad array of Asian Americans “are coming out of the woodwork” for Harris.
    

            He’s said he’s getting texts, emails and Signal messages from people who have never donated before but who see themselves in her story as the first generation born in the US to immigrant parents.
    

            “These are people who don’t get the DNC emails,” Narasimhan said, raising his hopes that the surge of interest among first-time givers will translate into electoral results for the Democratic Party in November.
    

            “This breadth of her extraordinary origin story could expand the base,” he said. “We always talk about how Trump expanded the base of the Republican Party. On a pure electoral side, this could be the first opportunity Democrats have had in a long time to expand the base.”
    

            The Indian American Impact Fund has seen a nearly 90% increase in contributions from new donors within the 24-hour window since Harris announced she was running, according to its executive director Chintan Patel.
    

            Patel said the group is planning a seven-figure investment to mobilize particularly South Asian and AAPI voters in battleground states.
    

            If Black women turn out at higher-than-expected levels in swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin – which Biden won by fewer than 21,000 votes out of 3.3 million cast in 2020 – that could well “be the margin of win” for Harris in November, said Carr of Higher Heights.
    

            But for all the early enthusiasm, the groups supporting Harris say big challenges remain – both in sustaining her campaign’s early financial momentum and in helping blunt looming attacks on her race and gender.
    

            Carr pointed to repeated and deliberate mispronunciations of Harris’ first name by her political foes as “whistleblowing to a population that doesn’t believe she can lead.”
    

            Harris “has run, won and governed on every level of government,” she said. “If you had that resume without putting her name or her pronouns on it … People would say, ‘This person should be president.’”
    

            Acker-Lyons said she is encouraging her network of donors to make even more financial investments, not just in Harris’ campaign but in outside groups that are prepared to defend her this fall and mobilize voters on her behalf.
    

            “Some of the large donors gave in the moment, but, hopefully, they will give again and add a zero going forward.”

CNN_17,Trump said he’d consider Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary but now says he doesn’t know who said that,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/trump-jamie-dimon-treasury-secretary/index.html,2024-07-24 10:56:00,politics,"
            Former President Donald Trump said in a recent interview he would consider nominating JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary, but on Tuesday said he doesn’t know who said that or where that came from.
    

            In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published earlier this month, Trump said, “I have a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.” He was then asked whether Dimon might be a future Trump administration Treasury secretary.
    

“He is somebody that I would consider, sure,” Trump said, according to the transcript posted online by Bloomberg.
    

            But on Tuesday, Trump posted on Truth Social, “I don’t know who said it, or where it came from, perhaps the Radical Left, but I never discussed, or thought of, Jamie Dimon or Larry Fink for Secretary of the Treasury.”
    

            Trump didn’t mention considering Fink, who is the CEO of BlackRock, in the Bloomberg interview.
    

            Trump’s comments on Dimon in the Bloomberg interview were a sharp departure from his previous posture on the JPMorgan chief executive. Trump bashed Dimon in November as a “Highly overrated Globalist” in a Truth Social Post after Dimon praised Nikki Haley, who was at the time still running for president in the GOP primary. But Dimon then said earlier this year he thought Trump was right about key issues and that bashing his “Make America Great Again” movement would hurt President Joe Biden.

CNN_18,Netanyahu will make speech to Congress as optimism for a ceasefire in Gaza rises,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html,2024-07-24 09:24:00,politics,"
            US and Israeli officials are voicing increased optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire and hostage deal being agreed to end the war in Gaza as the loved ones of hostages being held by Hamas say that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must take the deal on offer.
    

            Efforts to secure an agreement have been ongoing for months and picked up renewed momentum in late May after US President Joe Biden laid out the details of a plan to bring home the hostages and eventually bring about an end to the war.
    

            Now, as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on Wednesday and meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, US officials claim a final deal is within reach. For the families of the hostages held more than nine months in Gaza, there is no time to wait.
    

            On Monday, Biden said he believed the different parties were on the “verge of being able to” secure a deal to bring home the hostages and end the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that they are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.”
    

            US officials insist that Israel and Hamas have both agreed to the broad framework of a deal, but specifics and crucial technicalities need to be hammered out. Mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been leading efforts to finalize those details.
    

            A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Tuesday that an Israeli delegation that was expected to leave on Thursday to transmit the latest Israeli response to the mediators is likely to delay its trip until at least Friday as a result of Netanyahu’s meeting with Biden being postponed until Thursday afternoon. The Israeli prime minister wants to meet with Biden before the Israeli delegation formally transmits its response to the mediators, the source said.
    

            The Israeli response is expected to include Netanyahu’s eleventh-hour demands regarding barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor – key sticking points in the negotiations. If Hamas agrees to those demands, a deal is likely to follow.
    

            “If Hamas will say yes, there will be a deal,” the source said.
    

            The latest Israeli response will also coincide with the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, going into recess next week. That will make it harder for any right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government. US officials have been sensitive to the Knesset recess as they remain convinced that politics are at play for Netanyahu back in Israel.
    

            Still, as Israel prepares to transmit its response, it has become increasingly clear to multiple parties involved that clinching a ceasefire now depends on the Israeli prime minister and his government.
    

            “It’s really Israel’s decision,” an official familiar with the talks told CNN.
    

            There’s real concern among the families of Israeli hostages as to whether Netanyahu is willing to make a deal to end the brutal war, after numerous false dawns suggesting a ceasefire was close.
    

            Aviva Siegel, a former hostage whose husband, Keith, is still a hostage, told CNN Tuesday that Netanyahu “has to take it and not continue the war.”
    

            “He needs to stop the war for kids to come home and the hostages to come home. They are much more important than continuing the war. They’ve suffered. I’ve been there. I know what the situation is. I know what they’re going through,” said Siegel, who was freed after 51 days in Hamas captivity.
    

            There are believed to be 116 people who were abducted during the October 7 Hamas attack remaining in Gaza – 44 of them are believed to be deceased. The families said ahead of Netanyahu’s address to Congress that they expect to hear the Israeli prime minister tell Congress that he has agreed to a deal – anything less, they said, is a failure.
    

            The families praised Biden’s leadership on the efforts to bring their loved one’s home but now that the US president has announced he will not seek reelection, they are urging him to ratchet up the pressure to finish the deal – something they say could be a key part of his legacy. The families are expected to meet with Biden and with Netanyahu on Thursday.
    

            “Not only should you not all collectively take your foot off the gas but put it on even harder and make sure that part of your legacy, Mr. President, is that you get the credit for saving the lives of as many of these hostages as possible,” said Jon Polin, the father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
    

            Indeed, the conflict in the Middle East has been a consuming issue for the US president since the October 7 attack. Whether it comes to an end before Biden’s first term will be consequential for his predecessor – whether that is Donald Trump, or possibly Harris, whom Biden has endorsed for the Democratic nomination. When Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House this week, she plans to convey to the Israeli leader that it is time for the war to end, a Harris aide said.
    

            Many Israelis, including family members of hostages, are convinced Netanyahu doesn’t want a deal, instead preferring to extend the war and thereby his grip on power.
    

            “We expect from our prime minister to cease all stalling, to cease torpedoing any hope for a negotiated return of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the suffering of the people of Gaza,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen. “We expect to hear him declare that Israel is going to sign this imperfect, imperfect agreement with Satan, meaning Hamas. But it is a national necessity and anything less than that would be a total failure of his leadership.”
    

            Netanyahu, who met on Monday in Washington with families of hostages, said his Israeli government is “determined to return everyone.”
    

            “The conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing a certain change, and I think this change will continue to grow,” the Israeli prime minister said.
    

            However, Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is being held hostage, said that “the urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with” Netanyahu at Monday night’s meeting.
    

            On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they “have significantly narrowed the disagreements between the parties,” but there are “a few remaining issues that need to be resolved.”
    

            “We continue discussions with the other mediators, and with the Government of Israel to try to reach resolution, but we don’t have that yet, and I don’t have any kind of forecast about when we might come to one,” Miller said.
    

            According to an official from a mediating country, the latest proposal from Hamas earlier this month “was very close” to the Israeli position from late May so when Hamas responded, it was believed that Israel’s reaction “would be positive and ready to move forward” with technical teams dispatched to iron out the final details.
    

            Negotiators are currently awaiting a response from Israel to a Hamas document received on July 3, according to that official, and recent Israeli responses have been unexpected and unclear, the official said, pointing to Israel’s reneging on a previous, critical position about allowing the unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza during a pause in the fighting.
    

            There’s also significant debate around the Philadelphi corridor and Rafah border crossing, both located between Egypt and Gaza. Netanyahu has argued Israel troops will not withdraw from the nine-mile-long Philadelphi corridor while Hamas has insisted on a full eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and their response, according to a source familiar, is expected to stick to that demand.
    

            A central sticking point has been whether a first pause in the fighting would flow seamlessly into a permanent ceasefire, something Israel has rejected. The Biden framework – and a UN resolution that followed – says the first phase will continue as long discussions do over a second phase. That, theoretically, could mean talks could break down and fighting resumes.
    

            Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains dire and US officials involved in the humanitarian and security efforts have grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli aggression in recent weeks. There remains no effective communication between the Israel Defense Forces and humanitarian groups, and just in the last week a UN convoy was shot at by the IDF. US officials believe it is possible that Israelis are seeking to put maximum pressure on Hamas ahead of a deal.
    

            If a first phase of the ceasefire is launched, Hamas is expected to release just over 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Biden’s natioanl security advisor Jake Sullivan acknowledged on Friday that the exact numbers and type of Palestinian prisoners to be released need to be finalized. There is still discussion around the number of vetoes Israel would have over Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants released, with an expectation that Israel would oppose more hardened prisoners serving longer – or life – sentences, according to details provided by the official from a mediating country, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations.
    

            As negotiations on the deal continue, there are also ongoing discussions about security, humanitarian aid, and governance once an agreement is put into place. Those discussions will continue with Netanyahu this week.
    

            US and Egyptian officials have begun preparing the flood of humanitarian aid that would enter Gaza if a ceasefire deal goes into effect. Egypt has worked to pre-position nearly 200,000 metric tons of supplies in the northern Egyptian city of el-Arish, one official familiar with the matter said, and talks to prepare for the enormous logistical effort have intensified in the last week.
    

            “What we can’t have is an agreement that’s followed by some kind of void that will either be filled, if it’s there, by Hamas coming back, which is unacceptable; by Israel prolonging its occupation, which they say they don’t want to do and is unacceptable; or just having a vacuum that’s filled by lawlessness, that’s filled by chaos, which we see in so many parts of Gaza right now, which is also inimical to actually helping people who desperately need it,” Blinken said Friday. “So making sure that we have a plan in place, which we’ve been working on also every single day – with Arab partners, with Israel, with many others for governance, for security, for humanitarian assistance, for reconstruction – that’s critical.”

CNN_19,Trump campaign files FEC complaint trying to block Biden funds transferring to Harris,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/trump-campaign-fec-complaint-block-biden-harris-funds/index.html,2024-07-24 08:43:00,politics,"
            The Trump campaign on Tuesday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing money raised for President Joe Biden’s reelection bid cannot be transferred to Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.
    

            The complaint was filed by the Trump campaign’s general counsel David Warrington and argues transferring the funds would amount to “little more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another.”
    

            “Kamala Harris is seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden’s leftover campaign cash — a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,” the complaint, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, states.

            The complaint is against Biden, Harris, the Biden campaign (which is now the Harris campaign) and campaign treasurer Keana Spencer for allegedly “flagrantly violating the Act by making and receiving an excessive contribution of nearly one hundred million dollars, and for filing fraudulent forms with the Commission purporting to repurpose one candidate’s principal campaign committee for the use of another candidate.”
    

            Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Kretchmer Lutvak responded to the FEC complaint in a statement Tuesday, saying, “Republicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims – like the ones they’ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections – will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election.”
    

            The statement also cited the campaign’s fundraising efforts so far, “raising $100 million in our first 36 hours and signing up 58,000 volunteers.”
    

            It’s unlikely that the commission would take any action until well after Election Day, given its slow pace of resolving enforcement questions.
    

            “I don’t think most campaign finance lawyers believe that this is a best reading of the law,” Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA’s law school, told CNN on Tuesday of the Trump campaign’s argument. But, he added, “that doesn’t mean it can’t get tied up in FEC proceedings for years.”
    

            An FEC spokesperson declined to comment, citing the agency’s policy on not discussing enforcement matters.
    

            Veteran Republican election lawyer Charlie Spies, who briefly served as the RNC’s general counsel earlier this year, argued recently that the Biden-Harris team must be formally nominated by their party before any money could be shifted.
    

            “If President Biden is committed to passing the torch to his vice president, and wants to be able to seed her campaign with the current Biden for President campaign war chest, he’ll first have to become his party’s legal nominee,” Spies wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal before Biden’s exit from the race.
    

            But other campaign finance experts disagree. And Federal Election Commissioner Dara Lindenbaum, a Democrat viewed as a swing vote on the evenly divided commission, has said Harris could access what Biden raised through the campaign committee because it is registered for both the president and vice president.
    

            Lindenbaum wrote on X, “If Kamala Harris becomes the Democratic Party nominee, she gets access to the Joe Biden campaign funds.”

CNN_20,What we know about the deputy charged with killing Sonya Massey in her home after she called 911 for help,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/sean-grayson-illinois-police-officer-shooting-sonya-massey/index.html,2024-07-25 04:42:00,us,"
            The family of Sonya Massey is calling for a probe into the hiring of a sheriff’s deputy charged with fatally shooting the 36-year-old Black woman in her Illinois home this month, citing their concerns over records showing he’d worked at six law enforcement agencies in four years and was charged with driving under the influence twice.
    

            Sean Grayson, the 30-year-old Sangamon County sheriff’s deputy who has since been fired from the agency, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct in connection with the July 6 shooting at Massey’s home near Springfield.
    

            He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records. The state’s training and standards board records show Grayson’s law enforcement certification has been suspended.
    

            CNN has sought comment from Grayson’s attorney.
    

            Massey is one of a number of Black women who have been killed by police in their own homes in recent years, including Breonna Taylor and Atatiana Jefferson.
    

            In a news conference Monday afternoon, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Massey’s family, connected her death to other cases of police violence against Black people across the US.
    

            Here’s what we know about the former sheriff’s deputy charged with murder in Massey’s death:
    

            Grayson had worked at six law enforcement agencies in Illinois since 2020, according to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board.
    

            He began working part-time with Pawnee police in August 2020, then moved to the Kincaid and Virden police departments, before taking up full-time work with Auburn police, the Logan County Sheriff’s Office and – in May 2023 – Sangamon County.
    

            Grayson’s resignation letter from the Auburn Police Department, reviewed by CNN, did not suggest he left due to problems or disciplinary issues. In it, he wrote: “I have had nothing but a positive experience working as an officer. Unfortunately, I have chosen to move on to Logan County Sheriff’s Office.”
    

            Grayson listed his reason for leaving both the Virden and Pawnee police departments as “wanting to be a full time” officer, and for the Kincaid Police Department as “my hours were cut,” according to his Auburn Police Department employment application, also reviewed by CNN.
    

            CNN has reached out to the other law enforcement agencies for more information.

A step-by-step look at how law enforcement’s visit to Sonya Massey’s home went so wrong


            Court records indicate Grayson was charged with two DUI misdemeanor offenses in Illinois’ Macoupin County – one in 2015 and the other in 2016.
    

            The first incident occurred in August 2015, when Grayson’s vehicle was impounded after he was charged with driving under the influence. He pleaded guilty to the charge and paid more than $1,320 in fines, according to court records. Another charge, accusing him of driving under the influence with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%, was dismissed.
    

            The following year in July, Grayson was charged again with DUI, pleaded guilty and paid more than $2,400 in fines, court records show.
    

            Grayson’s job application to the Auburn Police Department acknowledges he had previously been arrested and charged with a DUI.
    

            A petition calling for an investigation into why Sangamon County hired Grayson was circulated at a march and barbecue in Springfield on Monday night, CNN affiliate WICS reported.
    

            Massey’s family and their lawyers called for the county to investigate the decision to hire him, voicing concerns about his arrest record and his working for six departments in four years, according to WICS.

Illinois police release bodycam video of fatal shooting of Black woman in her home


            The Illinois State Police on Monday released 36-minutes of video that includes body-camera footage from each of the two Sangamon County sheriff’s deputies who responded to Massey’s house early on July 6. Massey had called 911 to report a possible “prowler” at her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors.
    

            The body-camera footage shows Grayson and another deputy speaking calmly with Massey in her home – at which point she goes to the stove to turn off a pot of boiling water. She then picks up the pot and the other deputy steps back, “away from your hot steaming water,” he says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she says in response.
    

            “Huh?” the deputy says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she repeats.
    

            “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says.
    

            He then draws his firearm and points it at her, and she ducks and says, “I’m sorry” while lifting the pot, the video shows.
    

            “Drop the f**king pot!” both deputies yell.
    

            Three shots are heard. After a few seconds of silence, one deputy says, “shots fired” and calls for emergency medical services.
    

            “Dude, I’m not taking f**king boiling water to the f**king head. And look, it came right to our feet, too,” Grayson says.
    

            Minutes after the shooting, Grayson speaks to another law enforcement figure. “She had boiling water and came at me with boiling water,” he says in the video. “She said she was going to rebuke me in the name of Jesus and came at (me) with boiling water.”
    

            Grayson did not activate his body camera until after he fatally shot Massey, according to charging documents. The other deputy had activated his body camera when he first arrived at the scene, the documents state.
    

            In the body-camera footage, Grayson tells his partner that Massey would not need medical help immediately after the shooting.
    

            The other deputy says he’s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.”
    

            Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies. When he gets back to the house, he asks if there’s anything he can do, but is told no.
    

            “All right, I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,” Grayson says.
    

            Next, Grayson leaves the house and speaks to a group of law enforcement officers outside. “Yeah, I’m good, this f**king b*tch is crazy,” he says, according to the footage.
    

            Since the shooting, local and state officials have criticized the deputy’s actions as an unjustified use of deadly force.
    

            A review of the Illinois State Police investigation into the shooting “does not support a finding that … Grayson was justified in his use of deadly force,” the state’s attorney for Sangamon County, John Milhiser, said in a July 17 news release.
    

            In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors said a “use-of-force” expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified.
    

            “(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,” the prosecutors wrote.
    

            The sheriff’s office said it has fired Grayson. “It is clear that the deputy did not act as trained or in accordance with our standards,” the office said.
    

            In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors noted Grayson could have drawn a Taser located on his duty vest.
    

            “He … has shown a willingness to use lethal force, despite the availability of non-deadly alternatives, when there is little to no threat to his bodily safety,” prosecutors wrote.
    

            In April 2021, Grayson was awarded a certificate for successfully completing a training course on how to use a Taser, according to documents obtained by CNN from the Auburn Police Department, his previous employer. He was also successfully trained on how to use pepper spray, the documents show.
    

            Massey’s father, James Wilburn, said during a news conference Monday he initially received conflicting information from law enforcement.
    

            “I was under the impression that a prowler had broken in and killed my baby. Never did they say that it was a deputy-involved shooting until my brother read it on the internet,” Wilburn said.
    

            At the news conference, Crump called her killing “senseless on every level.”
    

            Crump referenced what Grayson said – “I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face” – before Massey was shot.
    

            “Black women don’t get the consideration and the respect in America,” Crump said.

CNN_21,"Man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie pleads not guilty to federal terrorism-related counts, lawyer says",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/salman-rushdie-stabbing-suspect-terrorism-charges/index.html,2024-07-25 03:59:00,us,"
            The man accused of stabbing author Salman Rushdie was charged with three federal terrorism-related counts, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday.
    

            Hadi Matar is charged with committing an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and providing material support to terrorists.
    

            He pleaded not guilty, attorney Nathaniel Barone said.
    

            In August 2022, Rushdie was stabbed several times onstage shortly before he was due to deliver a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. Matar has already pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault in connection with the stabbing.

Man accused of stabbing renowned author Salman Rushdie rejects plea deal that tied in federal terrorism-related charge


            Federal authorities allege in the unsealed grand jury indictment that Matar attempted to provide material support and resources – including “himself, and services” to “a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely, Hizballah,” according to the four-page indictment.
    

            The indictment alleges Matar “did knowingly attempt to kill, and did knowingly maim, commit an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, and assault with a dangerous weapon, a person within the United States.” It does not mention Rushdie by name.
    

            Matar recently rejected a state plea deal that would have tied in a federal terrorism-related charge and reduced his state prison sentence.
    

            Barone previously told CNN his client “has maintained his innocence, not only on the state charges, but will continue to maintain his innocence on the federal charges as well.”
    

            “In addition, Mr. Matar will exercise any and all of his fundamental and constitutional rights in defending this matter to the fullest,” Barone said.
    

            Matar’s next appearance in federal court is scheduled for August 7. If convicted of the federal charges, he could face life in prison, his attorney said.
    

            Matar is due to appear in state court in October, according to Barone.
    

            Rushdie, 77, has garnered widespread acclaim and scrutiny for his literary work. His fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses,” drew condemnation from some Muslims who found it to be sacrilegious.
    

            The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who described the book as an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed, issued a religious decree, or fatwa, calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989.

CNN_22,"An ATV driver ran over an 80-year-old man posting Trump signs in his yard, police say",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/michigan-atv-trump-signs/index.html,2024-07-25 02:44:00,us,"
            An 80-year-old man putting up Trump election signs in his front yard was run over by an ATV driver during what police believe was a politically motivated crime spree in a small town in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The victim was left in critical condition and the suspect was found dead by suicide the next day, according to police.
    

            Local authorities in the swing state condemned political violence in the wake of an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during an especially tense election year.
    

             On Sunday evening around 5:45 p.m., a 22-year-old man driving an ATV in a Hancock neighborhood stopped in front of a house with multiple Trump election signs posted in the front yard, Hancock Police Lt. David Outinen told CNN.
    

            The 22-year-old ripped the signs out of the lawn, threw them in the street and drove away on the ATV. Shortly after, the suspect returned on the ATV as the 80-year-old resident tried to put the signs back up in the yard. The suspect veered off the road and hit the 80-year-old from behind, Outinen said.

            The 80-year-old was transported to a local hospital, where he was in critical condition, police said.
    

            Around 7:45 p.m. on the same day, police received a report of a vandalized pickup truck displaying a “thin blue line” sticker, used to show support for law enforcement. A valve stem on one of the tires was cut, leading to a flattened tire, according to Outinen.
    

            Police received another report of a vandalized pickup truck in the area around 8:05 p.m. A shovel was used to smash the windshield of the truck, which displayed a Trump bumper sticker. The truck was left with broken windows, smashed taillights and flattened tires, Outinen said.
    

            Police believe the 22-year-old suspect is responsible for the incidents, after collecting video surveillance of him in all three locations, Hancock Police Chief Tami Sleeman told CNN.
    

            The next day, police received a message from someone at an address in neighboring Quincy Township saying they wanted to “confess a crime involving an ATV driver within the last 24 hours” and asking them to “send someone to pick me up,” the Houghton County Sheriff’s Office said in a release.
    

            Police say when responders arrived at the residence, they found the 22-year-old suspect had died by suicide. Authorities have not identified him. At the scene – less than 3 miles from where the 80-year-old was struck – police found the ATV and the clothes the suspect had worn during the attack on the 80-year-old man, according to the release.
    

            Several electronic devices recovered from the residence where the suspect was found will be searched by computer forensic specialists, according to the sheriff’s office.
    

            There is no indication the suspect knew any of the victims, and he had no prior history with the Hancock Police Department, Outinen said.
    

            The sheriff’s office said it is working with local and state authorities, including the FBI, on the ongoing investigation.

CNN_23,The latest pre-trial developments in the case of Idaho quadruple murder suspect Bryan Kohberger,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html,2024-07-24 22:29:00,us,"
            The defense team of Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students in their off-campus home in 2022, filed a memorandum Monday in support of moving the case out of town, saying he can’t receive a fair trial in Latah County “because of the extensive publicity that is ongoing and inflammatory.”
    

            The filing is the latest pre-trial motion in Kohberger’s quadruple murder trial, which is set to begin in June 2025.
    

            It’s been a long and winding road since the four students – Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen – were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school’s main campus in Moscow, Idaho.
    

            Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf in May 2023, and his attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty.
    

            The progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings that have frustrated the family of one of the victims as well as the judge overseeing the case.
    

            The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys’ access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger’s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case.
    

            Here’s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far:
    

June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case.
    

June 23, 2023: Latah County Judge John Judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a “substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.”
    

August 2, 2023: Kohberger’s attorneys said they would use an alibi defense but couldn’t pin down their client’s specific location on the night of the killings because he was “driving during the late night and early morning hours.”
    

            “Mr. Kohberger is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr. Kohberger was at each moment of the hours” of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing.
    

October 26, 2023: The judge denied a request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions.
    

December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire.
    

February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger.

‘This case is turning into a hamster wheel’: Family of slain Idaho student frustrated at pace of murder trial


            Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person’s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene, according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing.
    

            The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper.
    

April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger’s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger’s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client’s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense’s side first.
    

            Judge said in April he wants a “hearing at least every month,” noting the importance of “cleaning up” the legal proceedings.
    

April 17, 2024: Kohberger’s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow on the night of the slayings.
    

April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue “without modification” after temporarily pausing them.
    

April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders.
    

May 2, 2024: Kohberger’s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public.
    

            After the hearing, the family of Goncalves, one of the victims, criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. “This case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,” adding they were “incredibly frustrated.”
    

May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting.
    

May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case.
    

            Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings.
    

            The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings.
    

            Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger’s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense.
    

            “Because of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I’m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,” he said.
    

June 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed “defense investigators” to view the material.
    

June 27, 2024: The parties set a trial date of June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing.
    

            “This is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,” he said.
    

July 22, 2024: Kohberger’s defense team filed a memorandum in support of moving the case out of Latah County, saying he can’t receive a fair trial there “because of the extensive publicity that is ongoing and inflammatory.” The defense suggested the trial be moved to Ada County, which includes Boise, about 300 miles south. A hearing to discuss the change of venue is set for August 29.

            President Joe Biden will deliver a rare Oval Office speech at 8 p.m. ET today on his decision to drop out of the 2024 race. It will be the first time the country hears from the president extensively since his abrupt decision to exit the presidential race on Sunday. Biden, who had been isolating at his home in Delaware since testing positive for Covid-19 nearly a week ago, tested negative on Tuesday, according to his physician, and is expected to return to the White House later in the day. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the first rally of her 2024 presidential campaign, told supporters in Wisconsin Tuesday that she will spend the coming weeks “continuing to unite our party” ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.
    

            Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday amid scrutiny of security lapses related to the recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. She acknowledged that on July 13, the day of the shooting at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally, the agency “fell short” of its mission “to protect our nation’s leaders.” There have been bipartisan calls in Congress for Cheatle’s resignation and a push by some Republicans to impeach her. Lawmakers were particularly incensed after her appearance in front of the House Oversight Committee on Monday, where she was unwilling to answer many of the committee’s questions. An extensive investigation is underway as authorities try to piece together details to uncover the shooter’s motive.
    

            At least 18 people were killed after a small plane skidded off the runway in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu today, local officials said. The pilot, who has been hospitalized, is the sole survivor of the Saurya Airlines crash. All of the passengers on board —18 Nepalis and a Yemeni citizen — were employees of the carrier, according to police. The aircraft crashed during takeoff from Kathmandu to the city of Pokhara and was en route for technical maintenance, an airline spokesperson said. The crash once again highlights the dangers of air travel in Nepal, a country often referred to as one of the riskiest places to fly due to multiple factors, including its mountainous terrain.
    

            Russia is offering Moscow residents a record $22,000 to fight in Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin scrambles to boost his troop numbers. The one-time signing bonus comes as Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds on in its third year. While Russia’s casualty figures remain shrouded in secrecy, estimates say the death toll among troops is high. More than 70,000 soldiers were likely killed or wounded in May and June alone, the UK Defense Ministry said. It is estimated that Russia has lost around 87% of the active-duty ground troops it had prior to launching its invasion of Ukraine and two-thirds of its pre-invasion tanks, a source familiar with a declassified US intelligence assessment told CNN in December.
    

            Sunday was the hottest day in recorded history, according to a climate tracking agency that has monitored temperatures since the mid-1900s. Around a hundred cities across the US are experiencing their hottest start to summer on record and swaths of southern Europe have been grappling with triple-digit temperatures. Global average temperatures typically peak during the Northern Hemisphere summer, between late June and early August. They also fluctuate based on natural factors: seasons, large-scale climate patterns and solar activity — and on unnatural factors: the pollution from human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, which is chiefly driving the planet’s temperature steadily upward.

— Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent, analyzing new body-camera footage showing the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who had called 911 for help. The disturbing video released Monday shows several clues suggesting Massey may have been experiencing a mental health issue during her interaction with police. The deputy has been fired from his role and charged with murder in the case.

CNN_25,A step-by-step look at how law enforcement’s visit to Sonya Massey’s home went so wrong,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/us/sonya-massey-police-shooting-what-went-wrong/index.html,2024-07-24 18:26:00,us,"
            The law enforcement visit to Sonya Massey’s home near Springfield, Illinois, earlier this month began with a calm conversation between the 36-year-old Black woman and two White sheriff’s deputies at her front door and in her living room.
    

            They asked how she was doing mentally and if she needed help. She said, “I love ya’ll,” and rifled through her belongings to find her ID.
    

            And then in the space of about 45 seconds, the deputies took a series of actions that left Massey lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor and led to murder charges against one of the deputies, Sean Grayson.
    

            How did this visit escalate so quickly?
    

            With help from law enforcement analysts and 36 minutes of body-camera footage released Monday, CNN took a closer look at what the deputies did and what they could have done differently. The analysts, as well as Illinois prosecutors and the sheriff, found Grayson took several steps to escalate the situation rather than lower the temperature and reassess Massey’s needs.

What we know about the deputy charged with killing Sonya Massey in her home after she called 911 for help


            “The Body Worn Camera footage has now been released, and the public can see what we saw: Sonya Massey lost her life due to an unjustifiable and reckless decision by former Deputy Sean Grayson,” Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell said in a statement Monday. “Grayson had other options available that he should have used. His actions were inexcusable and do not reflect the values or training of our office.”
    

            Grayson, 30, was indicted by a grand jury last week on three counts of first-degree murder and one count each of aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has entered a not guilty plea and was denied pretrial release, according to court records.
    

            While some policing experts may be hesitant to critically analyze the actions of police officers after the fact, the Police Executive Research Forum, an independent organization focusing on best practices in law enforcement, advises department leaders to gather their officers and review controversial use-of-force incidents.
    

            Chuck Wexler, the organization’s executive director, said their training helps police resolve situations that don’t involve firearms.
    

            “If at any point the situation starts to go in a different direction, then you have to have a plan B,” he said. “These officers did not have a plan B except pulling out their firearm and barking orders. That’s simply an archaic practice. We teach officers that if you slow things down and communicate using time and distance, you can resolve these situations so everybody can go home safely.”
    

What happened: The interaction began after midnight on July 6 after Massey called 911 to report a possible “prowler” outside her home in Springfield, according to a court document filed by prosecutors. The two deputies arrived and searched around the house before knocking on Massey’s door to speak with her.
    

            From the start of their interaction, there are a number of clues suggesting Massey may be experiencing a mental health issue. She has trouble understanding and answering their basic questions, and when they ask if she’s doing alright mentally, she says, “Yes, I took my medicine,” according to the body camera footage. The house appears messy in the video, with clothes strewn across her bedroom and the kitchen counter covered in items.
    

            In a news conference Monday, Massey’s family and their attorney Ben Crump said she had mental health challenges.
    

What the experts say: A key component of an officer’s interaction with the public is assessing whether they are dealing with someone who could be experiencing a mental health crisis, said Josh Campbell, CNN security correspondent and former federal agent.
    

            According to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which conducts training and recommends best practices for law enforcement, such a situation requires “the use of special skills, techniques, and abilities to effectively and appropriately resolve the situation, while minimizing violence.”
    

            The IACP says, “Officers are not expected to diagnose mental or emotional conditions, but rather to recognize behaviors that are potentially indicative” of someone in crisis.
    

            John Miller, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, said the officers could have spoken with her further to assess whether she was a danger to herself or others.
    

            “There’s a list of questions that you don’t have to be a mental health professional to ask,” Miller added, “such as, do you have family looking after you, are you receiving services from the county, do you have a social worker?”
    

            “There’s a gap in police training for how to deal with people in crisis, deescalate and use non-lethal tools when situations start to spiral,” he said.
    

What happened: When the deputies are inside the home speaking with Massey, they note a pot of boiling water on the lit stove, and Massey gets up and moves to the kitchen to turn off the heat and take the pot off the stove.
    

            “We don’t need a fire while we’re here,” one deputy says.
    

            Neither officer has any issue with her going over to get the pot, the video shows.
    

What the experts say: “Again, this appears a missed opportunity that could have ensured a much different ending,” Campbell said. “If time allows, officers are trained to observe the totality of a situation and to assess multiple possible outcomes for any public interaction. Allowing someone potentially in crisis near a dangerous object is recipe for a negative outcome.”
    

            Miller noted this moment as an issue of controlling the subject and the scene.
    

            “They allow her to walk over to a pot of boiling water,” he said. “If they believed she constituted some kind of threat, they could have called her over to them, and one of the officers could’ve walked over, turned off the stove and poured the water out.”
    

What happened: When she grabs the pot of boiling water, one deputy steps back “away from your hot steaming water,” he says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she says in response.
    

            “Huh?” the deputy says.
    

            “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” she repeats.
    

            “You better f**king not or I swear to God I’ll f**king shoot you in the f**king face,” Grayson says to her.
    

What the experts say: IACP researchers have noted a low tone of voice may be preferable when dealing with someone in mental distress and that making threats “may create additional fright, stress, and potential aggression,” Campbell said.
    

            “While an officer is certainly well within their rights to use whatever volume of voice they believe is required to obtain compliance from a subject, law enforcement experts here again draw a distinction for someone in mental crisis,” he said.
    

            Miller similarly said “calmer dialogue” could have been used.
    

What happened: After threatening Massey, Grayson immediately draws his firearm and points it at her. She ducks and says, “I’m sorry,” the video shows.
    

What the experts say: “The gun is the ultimate escalation,” Miller said. “It cuts you off from other tools and is hard to turn back from, sometimes resulting in these fatalities.”
    

            In a court document filed by the state last week, prosecutors noted Grayson could have drawn a Taser located on his duty vest.
    

            “He … has shown a willingness to use lethal force, despite the availability of non-deadly alternatives, when there is little to no threat to his bodily safety,” prosecutors wrote.
    

What happened: Both officers yell at her to “drop the f**king pot,” and Grayson takes three steps toward her as he tries to move around a kitchen counter, the video shows.
    

What the experts say: The deputies could have stepped away from Massey and create distance from the pot of boiling water, the experts said.
    

            Campbell said the deputies were at a crossroads at this point.
    

            “Officers across the country are called upon every day to make split-second decisions when faced with a threat – in this case, a subject holding a pot of scalding water, which certainly could have injured the deputies,” he said.

            “Effective policing comes down to good judgment in highly stressful situations,” he said. “Although being doused with scalding water could warrant the use of deadly force by an officer to stop a threat, in this video we certainly don’t see officers attempting alternative options, such as moving away and creating distance between themselves and Massey.”
    

            Miller said, “When she comes across with the pot, rather than extend the distance between her and them, they close in giving excited commands and raised voices.”
    

            In the state’s court filing, prosecutors said a “use-of-force” expert had reviewed the body-camera footage and concluded the use of deadly force was not justified.
    

            “(The expert) likened the scenario to an officer intentionally and unnecessarily putting himself in front of a moving vehicle and then justifying use of force because of fear of being struck,” the prosecutors wrote.
    

What happened: After the shooting, Grayson failed to provide any medical care for Massey and was dismissive of efforts to do so, the video shows.
    

            Grayson’s partner says he’s going to get a medical kit to help, but Grayson responds, “Nah, she’s done. You can go get it but that’s a headshot.”
    

            “Let her f**king just – there’s nothing we can do man,” he says.
    

            After about two minutes, his partner grabs a towel and leans down to try to help Massey, and he notes “she’s still gasping a bit.” Grayson later goes to his vehicle to get his own medical supplies, and when he gets back to the house, he is told there’s nothing he can do for her.
    

            “Alright, I’m not even gonna waste my med stuff then,” Grayson says.
    

What the experts say: It’s not clear whether faster medical aid might have helped Massey – her condition after the shooting is heavily blurred in the video – but the deputy’s actions and words show a lack of compassion, experts said.
    

            “It may be perplexing to some readers, but an officer who employs deadly force actually has an obligation to immediately shift to rendering aid if the subject of their force no longer poses a threat,” Campbell said. “Although we don’t see the nature of Massey’s injuries in the blurred video, officers waited over two minutes before moving in to apply pressure on her bullet wounds.”
    

            Miller said: “While he does not interfere with his partner’s effort to follow procedure and render medical aid, Grayson discourages it and is dismissive of it, which may have not made any difference medically but is an indicator of a passive contempt for procedure and a lack of compassion.”

CNN_26,US Army worker who stole nearly $109 million to buy mansions and luxury cars is sentenced,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/us-army-worker-mello-sentenced/index.html,2024-07-24 12:24:00,us,"
            A Texas woman who pleaded guilty to charges of stealing nearly $109 million from a youth development program for children of military families and using it to fund an extravagant lifestyle that included multiple mansions, a fleet of luxury cars and designer accessories was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in federal prison.
    

            Janet Yamanaka Mello, 57, was sentenced by US District Judge Xavier Rodriguez after pleading guilty in March to five counts of mail fraud and five counts of filing a false tax return.
    

            Prosecutors say Mello, a civilian employee at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, stole the money and used it to purchase one lavish item after another, including $923,000 of jewelry in a single day in 2022.
    

            Mello was a financial manager who handled funding for a youth program at the military base and determined whether grant money was available. She created a fraudulent group called Child Health and Youth Lifelong Development, prosecutors said.
    

            “Janet Mello betrayed the trust of the government agency she served and repeatedly lied in an effort to enrich herself,” said US Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas.
    

            “Rather than $109 million in federal funds going to the care of military children throughout the world, she selfishly stole that money to buy extravagant houses, more than 80 vehicles and over 1,500 pieces of jewelry,” Esparza said.
    

            Defense attorney Albert Flores said Mello is deeply remorseful.
    

            “She realizes she committed a crime, she did wrong and is very ashamed,” Flores said.
    

            Flores said Mello has saved many things she bought with the money and hopes the items are sold to reimburse the government. “I don’t think the court gave us enough credit for that, but we can’t complain,” Flores said.
    

            The defense has no plans to appeal, he said.
    

            Prosecutors said Mello used the fake organization she created to apply for grants through the military program. She filled out more than 40 applications over six years, illegally receiving nearly $109 million, assistant US Attorney Justin Simmons wrote in a court document asking for Mello to be sentenced to more than 19 years in prison.
    

            Mello used the money to buy millions of dollars of real estate, clothing, high-end jewelry and 82 vehicles that included a Maserati, a Mercedes, a 1954 Corvette and a Ferrari Fratelli motorcycle.
    

            Agents executing a search warrant in 2023 found many of the vehicles with dead batteries because they had not been operated in so long, Simmons wrote.
    

            Prosecutors said Mello was able to steal so much because of her years of experience, expert knowledge of the grant program, and accumulated trust among her supervisors and co-workers.
    

            “Mello’s penchant for extravagance is what brought her down,” said Lucy Tan, acting special agent in charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation’s field office in Houston.
    

            A co-worker and friend of Mello’s, Denise Faison, defended Mello in a letter to the judge.
    

            “Janet Mello is a good, kind, caring and loving person that would do no harm to anyone,” Faison wrote. “Janet has so much more to offer the world. Please allow her to repay her debt to society by returning what she has taken but not be behind prison bars.”

CNN_27,Chicago-area gas prices are surging after a tornado nearly took out a refinery,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/economy/chicago-area-gas-prices-refinery-tornado/index.html,2024-07-25 04:53:00,us,"
            Gas prices have spiked in and around Chicago after a tornado sidelined a major ExxonMobil oil refinery last week.
    

            A gallon of gas in Chicago is now selling for an average of $4.34, according to AAA.
    

            That’s 27 cents more expensive than just a week ago after a tornado narrowly missed the Joliet Refinery and knocked power out to the Channahon, Illinois, facility.
    

            But it’s not just Chicago getting hit with higher prices.
    

            The top 10 US metro areas experiencing the biggest one-week gas price increases are all located in the region, according to AAA.
    

            In Gary, Indiana, the average price for regular gasoline has spiked by 41 cents over the past week to $3.65 a gallon.
    

            In Wisconsin — a key battleground state that Vice President Kamala Harris visited Tuesday — gas prices have increased sharply over the past week in Kenosha County (+31 cents), Milwaukee-Waukesha (+27 cents) and Racine (+24 cents).
    

            Gas prices have also jumped in nearby Michigan, another battleground state in the upcoming presidential election.
    

            Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, noted there are estimates that the refinery will be sidelined for three weeks. Even then, there’s no guarantee it will be back to normal. In the meantime, gasoline is being shipped from the Gulf Coast to the Chicago area, he said.
    

            The Joliet Refinery now has enough power to assess damage to the equipment and begin the work of restarting operations, Exxon spokesperson Catie Tuley told CNN on Wednesday. Exxon declined to speculate on how long the restart will take.
    

            “We’ve brought in additional resources to get the refinery safely restarted as soon as possible to supply critical fuels to Chicago and the Midwest,” Tuley said.
    

            Lipow said the government can help by relaxing gasoline quality specifications for metro areas. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken similar steps during previous supply crunches.
    

            “It will increase supply and lower prices,” Lipow said.
    

            EPA spokesperson Shayla Powell told CNN in a statement Wednesday that response teams from the agency as well as the Department of Energy have been “coordinating with the refinery and state emergency response teams since the refinery shutdown to monitor the impact of the shutdown on gasoline supplies into the area.” The work, she added, is ongoing.

            The NBA on Wednesday rejected Warner Bros. Discovery’s offer to match a $1.8 billion per year bid from Amazon Prime Video to broadcast the league’s games, setting up a potential legal showdown between the media company and its longtime sports partner.
    

            “Warner Bros. Discovery’s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video’s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,” the NBA said in a statement.
    

            The league noted that its new partnership with Amazon will complement its broadcast, cable, and streaming packages that were also awarded to NBC and Disney’s ESPN.
    

            “All three partners have also committed substantial resources to promote the league and enhance the fan experience,” the NBA said. “We are grateful to Turner Sports for its award-winning coverage of the NBA and look forward to another season of the NBA on TNT.”
    

            The announcement comes less than 48 hours after WBD, CNN’s parent company, notified the league of its intention to match Amazon’s bid in order to retain the right to broadcast the games, a deal that threatens the media company’s cable and streaming ambitions.
    

            WBD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in recent weeks, WBD executives have suggested that if the NBA declines to accept its matching offer, it could bring a lawsuit.
    

            The months of dealmaking and uncertainty over the NBA rights had set off alarms both inside and out of WBD, raising the prospect that TNT Sports’ nearly four decades as an NBA partner and home to the beloved “Inside the NBA” show could come to an end.

            If there’s one emotion that Disney and Pixar are probably feeling right now, it’s joy.
    

            That’s after movie sequel “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated film of all time, raking in $1.46 billion at the global box office and dethroning former record holder “Frozen 2” from 2019, according to Disney on Wednesday.
    

            That’s giving a much-needed boost to Hollywood, which saw a slow start to the summer season and is still grappling with the effects of the writers’ and actors’ strikes of last year.
    

            “Inside Out 2” hit theaters last month and passed the $1 billion mark just 19 days after its release — the fastest ever for an animated film. It’s currently on week six of its theatrical run and has already bagged a spot as the 13th highest-grossing film of all time.
    

            “From Europe to Asia, the Middle East the US, you just see incredible, record-breaking numbers for a movie,” said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. “It’s definitely a great success story, not only for movie theaters here in the United States, but all over the world.”
    

            The film has already made history in the Americas, quickly becoming the highest-grossing film in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Uruguay’s cinema scene.
    

            And Loria predicts the film could end its theatrical run with even higher numbers as it prepares to open in Japan next week, having already enjoyed successes across Asia and the Pacific, making $84 million just after 12 days of release.
    

            “It really breathed new life into the global box office and reestablished a momentum that we haven’t seen since the ‘Barbenheimer’ craze of last summer,” Loria said.
    

            The excitement surrounding the “Inside Out 2“ release comes after the film industry was met with a slow start to the summer movie season.
    

            “The record-breaking performance of ‘Inside Out 2’ has been incredibly important for movie theatres as the film swooped in and changed the mood of this industry that, at the time of the film’s release, saw a summer movie season that was being written off as a box office bust,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.
    

            Last summer, blockbusters “Barbie” (which is distributed by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery) and “Oppenheimer” combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. So far, 2024 has yet to produce a combo with that same box-office draw.

CNN_30,Disneyland avoids what would have been its first strike in 40 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/disneyland-strike-averted/index.html,2024-07-25 04:03:00,us,"
            Disneyland has averted the possibility of the first employee strike in 40 years by reaching a tentative agreement with 14,000 workers on Tuesday.
    

            Approximately 9,500 of those employees whose contract had already expired voted Friday to authorize a strike, which had yet to be scheduled as planned negotiations continued early this week. The bargaining group of four unions, represents workers including ticket takers, candy makers, custodians, retail workers, and ride operators.
    

            After the tentative deal on Tuesday, Disneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good said, “We care deeply about the wellbeing of our cast members and are pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with Master Services Council that addresses what matters most to our cast while positioning Disneyland Resort for future growth and job creation.”
    

            “I’m excited, overwhelmed and beyond the moon,” said Cyn Carranza, a Disneyland resort employee.
    

            Union leaders said they will not release details of the tentative agreement until employees have the chance to review and vote on the contract next Monday.
    

            The bargaining committee said in a statement that they had reached this tentative agreement after four months of hard-fought negotiations: “We have shown Disney that we are the true magic makers of the park and today proves that when workers stand together for what they deserve, we win. We look forward to making our voices heard during the voting process to ratify this contract.”

CNN_31,Nasdaq and S&P 500 log worst day since 2022 after Alphabet and Tesla fail to impress Wall Street,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/investing/stocks-alphabet-and-tesla-earnings/index.html,2024-07-25 04:02:00,us,"
            Tech shares led a selloff Wednesday after lackluster earnings reports from two of the market’s most prominent heavyweights.
    

            The Nasdaq Composite declined 3.6% and the S&P 500 fell 2.3%, both notching their worst daily percentage declines since 2022. The Dow lost 504 points, or 1.3%.
    

            Big Tech’s decline comes after Tesla’s second-quarter results released Tuesday evening showed a second-straight decline in quarterly profit and that its profits plunged more than 40% from a year ago. The electric vehicle maker faces growing competition from established automakers domestically and internationally and a slowdown in EV sales growth.

Tesla stock tumbles after its profit plunged


            Tesla shares fell 12.3% on Wednesday. The EV-maker didn’t give a new sales forecast for the year but warned that its vehicle volume growth rate this year could be substantially lower than that of 2023.
    

            Elsewhere, Alphabet shares slid 5% after reporting a miss on expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.
    

            “The flight to quality of Mega Tech is becoming vulnerable to earnings that cannot have even minor disappointments,” wrote Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates, in a Wednesday note, adding that “the AI narrative isn’t broken.”
    

            Thursday’s tumble extends the decline in tech stocks seen during the past week after a cool inflation report and resilient economic data led investors to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.
    

            Wall Street has rotated out of the tech bigwigs that led stocks higher over the past year in favor of smaller stocks that have been beaten down by sky-high rates. The Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of US small-cap stocks, is up 7.6% for the month, outperforming the S&P 500’s 0.6% loss. Still, small-caps fell on Wednesday.
    

            A confluence of other factors has also battered the tech sector recently. Investors have contended with an ongoing global tech outage that has left travelers stranded at airports, consumers at risk of getting duped by cybercriminals and brought computer systems across health care and government sectors to a halt.
    

            The Nasdaq last week had its worst day since 2022, after the selloff in tech was worsened by a report from Bloomberg that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.
    

As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.

CNN_32,10 migrants killed in floods crossing Darién Gap in Panama,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/americas/darien-gap-floods-kill-migrants-intl-latam/index.html,2024-07-25 03:44:00,world,"
            Ten migrants drowned in a flooded river near Panama’s coastal community of Carreto while crossing the Darién Gap, Panama’s National Border Service (Senafront) said Wednesday.
    

            Senafront did not specify the nationalities of the migrants or when they drowned.
    

            The agency said the case is still under investigation but suspects that transnational organized criminals and local collaborators led the migrants through unauthorized border crossings, putting their lives at risk.
    

            The Darién Gap is a mountainous rainforest region connecting Colombia in South America to Panama in Central America that is a crucial passage for migrants hoping to reach the United States and Canada.
    

            There has recently been an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety on the 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike required to cross it and the United States and Panama signed an agreement earlier this month aimed at closing “the passage of illegal immigrants” through it.

Panama installs barbed wire to block migrants traveling through the Darién Gap


            Since the beginning of July, Panama’s new government, led by President José Raúl Mulino, has placed barbed wire across several routes in the Darién Gap, so that migrants who enter illegally through the border with Colombia are forced to use a single authorized entrance, according to the country’s Ministry of Public Security.
    

            “I will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,” Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony.
    

            Senafront said the only authorized migration corridor is one that leads to Cañas Blancas, “where specialized patrols are available for their protection and humanitarian assistance.”

            At least six workers have died in an explosion and fire at a tequila factory in Mexico, local authorities said.
    

            Two others were injured in the disaster, at a Casa Cuervo distillery in the town of Tequila, Jalisco state. Casa Cuervo is the world’s largest producer of the Mexican spirit, according to its website, encompassing the Jose Cuervo and Tequila 1800 brands, among others.
    

            “The incident involved the explosion of a tank car,” Jalisco’s civil protection agency said, adding that the fire ignited three additional tank cars, each with a capacity of 219,000 liters.
    

            The cause of the fire is not yet known, authorities said. At least 40 firefighting and civil protection teams responded to the incident.
    

            In a statement, Casa Cuervo said it was assisting authorities with their investigation and would reinforce security controls at its facilities.
    

            The state’s Civil Protection agency said that another fire broke out at the factory Wednesday morning in a storage area for cardboard and other materials, but that fire was quickly controlled and no additional risks were reported.
    

            The mayor of Tequila, Alfonso Magallanes, shared a post on his Facebook page urging residents not to approach the factory due to the ongoing situation.
    

            Jalisco state is the largest producer of agave, the key ingredient in tequila, generating nearly 75% of the nation’s annual crop. The town of Tequila, which gives the liquor its name, is a center for tourism, receiving an average of more than one million visitors annually from Mexico and abroad, according to data from the mayor’s office.
    

            In February, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a law to change National Tequila Day from the third Saturday of March to July 24, to coincide with the same date celebrated in the United States, its northern neighbor and largest trading partner.
    

            The US is the largest market for Mexican tequila exports. Adjusted for inflation, between 2014 and 2019, tequila imports increased from $1.1 billion to $4.9 billion, according to 2023 figures from the US Department of Agriculture.

            At least 15 people have died and more than 195 are missing after a boat carrying migrants capsized near Mauritania’s capital Nouakchott, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Wednesday.
    

            The Mauritanian coastguard has rescued 120 people since the boat capsized Monday, including unaccompanied and separated children, according to IOM.
    

            “We are deeply saddened by the death of 15 migrants and the estimated disappearance at sea of 195-plus people after a boat capsized in Nouakchott,” IOM’s West and Central Africa office said on X.
    

            Rescue efforts are underway to locate the missing.
    

            The passengers boarded the boat in Gambia seven days ago. IOM didn’t specify the nationalities of the dead or how the boat capsized. CNN has reached out to the UN agency for details.

CNN_35,"Powerful Typhoon Gaemi churns toward Taiwan, expected to drench an already soaked China",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/typhoon-gaemi-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-25 00:34:00,world,"
            A powerful typhoon is bearing down on Taiwan, killing at least two people and injuring hundreds of others as authorities close financial markets, schools and offices.
    

            Conditions in Taiwan have worsened as Typhoon Gaemi brought heavy rainfall, gusty winds and a dangerous storm surge.
    

            The two deaths include a woman riding a motorcycle in Kaohsiung City, who was crushed to death by a fallen tree, and a woman in Hualien, who was hit by a parapet falling from the roof of a house, Taiwan’s Central Emergency Operations Center reported. At least 201 other people have been wounded.
    

            The rapidly intensifying storm had been expected to strengthen into a super typhoon before making landfall on Taiwan’s northeastern coast Wednesday afternoon. However it was deflected off its forecast track by Taiwan’s mountainous terrain and has spent more than six hours offshore making a loop near the Hualien coastline instead of making landfall.
    

            Hualien, eastern Taiwan’s most populated city, has been hit with additional hours of the typhoon’s worst conditions, including winds over 100 mph (160 kph), storm surge, and torrential rainfall. Rainfall totals have already topped 300 mm (1 foot) in many locations, with mountainous areas receiving over 500 m (1.5 feet).
    

            The deflection was caused by mountains disrupting the storm’s wind field. The phenomenon has been documented numerous times over the past 60 years in typhoons approaching northeast Taiwan, with several making full loops before eventually moving over land.
    

            The interaction with land has weakened Typhoon Gaemi slightly, with its top winds down from 230 kph (145 mph) to 205 kph (125 mph), making Gaemi a strong Category 3 hurricane-equivalent, according to the latest update from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
    

            Taiwan is often struck by typhoons and has a generally strong track record in preparing for the damaging winds and downpours they can bring, especially in its cities. The more at-risk populations tend to be in remote and mountainous areas, especially on the east side of the island, where landslides can pose a major danger.
    

            Taiwan’s Central Meteorological Agency (CMA) has issued a sea and land typhoon warning for the entire main island, while Taiwan President Lai Ching-te urged residents not to make trips unless they can ensure their safety.
    

            Typhoon Gaemi has strengthened in Pacific waters that have been at their warmest temperatures on record. The first typhoon of the season to affect Taiwan, it strengthened by 96 kph (60 mph) over a 24-hour period, well exceeding the definition of rapid intensification of 56 kph (35 mph) in 24 hours. Scientists have found that hotter oceans caused by the human-caused climate crisis are leading storms to intensify more rapidly.

            Most Taiwanese cities, including the capital Taipei, chipmaking hub Hsinchu and the southern city of Kaohsiung, closed schools and offices on Wednesday while Taiwan Railways suspended some rapid train services. More than 50,000 households in Kaohsiung City were without power.
    

            Dozens of flights and all regular train services have also been canceled for Wednesday and Thursday, with three of Taiwan’s largest carriers – EVA Air, China Airlines and Starlux Airlines – announcing disruptions due to the typhoon.
    

            Taiwan’s defense authorities said they had to modify ongoing annual five-day Han Kuang War Games due to the typhoon. The live-fire drills are the biggest annual military exercises of their kind in Taiwan, where the armed forces are increasingly vigilant against the threat of invasion from China.
    

            “We will adjust some of the air and naval elements given the typhoon situation,” defense ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fiang told reporters in Hualien.
    

            Gaemi has also forced the closure of schools and government offices in the Philippines as heavy rains hit the Manila capital region and the main island of Luzon. Some flights have been canceled and the Philippine Stock Exchange said it would cease all trading Wednesday.
    

            Images show roads and streets in Manila flooded by rains brought by the storm, as people wade through knee-deep water.
    

            Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier said more than 770,000 people have been affected by the typhoon and southwest monsoon in the country’s southern regions, and 4,500 personnel were on standby to assist with search and rescue operations.

            Though weakened, Gaemi is expected to make landfall in China on Thursday as the equivalent to a strong Category 1 or low-end Category 2 hurricane with sustained winds of 145 to 160 kph (90 to 100 mph.)
    

            The worst of the winds are expected to occur in coastal areas of Fujian province, where boats have moored to take shelter and trains will be suspended Thursday, but heavy rain will spread across Fujian, southern Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces for the rest of the week.
    

            By the weekend, the remnants of Gaemi will likely spread heavy rainfall farther north into areas of China like Henan, Shanxi and Hebei provinces which have been hit hard by flooding in recent days.
    

            For many in China, the prospect of another major storm bringing more water is a big concern.
    

            In the past two weeks, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated across multiple provinces in China following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock.
    

            Torrential rainfall hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule.
    

            In Henan province, the flooding came after a period of scorching temperatures that complicated efforts to grow and irrigate vital crops in parts of central China’s agricultural heartland. Then, extreme rain inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media.
    

            The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces – and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks – has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that’s forecast to continue.

CNN_36,"Russian transgender politician reverses decision to detransition, saying she was acting ‘out of fear’",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/europe/yulia-alyoshina-russian-transgender-politician-fear-intl/index.html,2024-07-25 00:23:00,world,"
            Russia’s first and only openly transgender politician has said she is no longer detransitioning, telling CNN that she had been previously driven by fear of Russia’s ban on gender reassignment.
    

            Alyoshina said she is now “ashamed” of posts she made earlier this year announcing the move.
    

            “I wrote and said this out of fear because gender reassignment and the non-existent LGBTQ+ movement are prohibited in the Russian Federation,” she said, adding: “I was born a woman in a man’s body.”
    

            Alyoshina transitioned from male to female in 2020, changing both her name and gender marker in her passport. “It was my sincere desire,” she told CNN. “I had been fighting for this for many years and underwent multiple psychiatric examinations.”
    

            Then, in May, Alyoshina changed her Telegram channel back to her pre-transition name and uploaded a pre-transition profile photo, saying she had decided to revert to her birth gender during Orthodox Lent, citing “spiritual anguish.”
    

            In a now-deleted post, Alyoshina also apologized to the Russian people, indicating a patriotic motive for her decision to remain in Russia. “I am a patriot of my country, that’s why I live in Russia,” Alyoshina said. Asked to clarify the move at the time, she told CNN, “I cannot give more detailed comments,” adding she did not feel safe to speak about it while still in Russia.
    

            On Wednesday, she explained to CNN that the move was prompted by her fear of persecution after appealing to the Russian Supreme Court in early 2024. Alyoshina filed an official request to the court in January seeking clarification on new legal restrictions, her status as a transgender person, potential extremist labeling for online publications and her ability to engage in public activities.
    

            When the court responded that it doesn’t provide explanations on current laws, she said she felt terrified that “the state repressive machine could turn on.”
    

            “I began sleeping poorly and waking up early, by springtime my anxiety and depression worsened,” Alyoshina said. The politician also feared that she might never achieve her life’s dream of undergoing gender reassignment surgery due to the new regulations.

            Unable to leave the country, Alyoshina told CNN she still does not feel safe but explained the need to come forward with the statement to stay true to herself. “I’m just tired of playing someone else’s role. I’m tired of pretending to be a man,” she said.
    

            She also remains vocal about the challenges faced by the LGBTQ+ community in present-day Russia, saying their rights are discriminated against and violated. “I hope my post will provide moral support to transgender people,” she said adding that it is currently impossible for a transgender person to change the documents even after an official medical diagnosis confirming their gender identity.
    

            President Vladimir Putin signed a widely criticized law in July 2023 prohibiting nearly all medical help for transgender people including gender reassignment surgery, except for treating “birth anomalies” in children.
    

            The legislation also bars transgender individuals from adopting children and allows authorities to annul their marriages.
    

            This move, along with stringent laws passed in December 2022 targeting so-called “LGBTQ propaganda,” is viewed as part of Russia’s broader policy to enforce what it refers to as “traditional values” and suppress LGBTQ+ rights. These policies have been widely criticized by human rights organizations and have significantly impacted the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals in the country, leading to increased fears, marginalization and a climate of oppression.
    

            In October 2022, when the State Duma passed the first reading of the anti-LGBTQ+ bill, Alyoshina decided to resign as regional head of the centrist, liberal-democratic Civic Initiative party and end her political career.
    

            “I have no idea how to continue to conduct public political activity as an openly transgender woman,” she said in a Telegram post at the time. However, in 2023, Alyoshina returned and announced her plans to run for governor in the Altai region of Siberia, before later dropping that campaign.
    

            Interviewed by CNN during the final stages of the law’s approval process in late 2022, Alyoshina criticized the new legislation, characterizing it as “just another brick in building an autocracy in Russia.” Alyoshina said she had been discriminated against as a transgender politician on numerous occasions but added the law would complicate further the already difficult life of all LGBTQ+ people in Russia.
    

            A study carried out in 2021 by Russia’s transgender support group, T-Action, estimated at least 30,000 transgender people have sought medical treatment or changed their legal documents. However, the actual number is likely much higher, despite an increased number of transgender individuals fleeing the country, the group’s coordinator, Anton Macintosh, told CNN. “Understandably, the majority stayed. It is not so easy to leave, especially for a transgender person,” he said.
    

            When asked what Alyoshina was hoping to achieve for other transgender people in Russia by coming forward with this statement, she replied: “I would like to convey the message: Don’t give up, keep fighting. As long as we keep fighting, we are alive.”

            At least nine people are dead and four are missing after a fishing vessel sank in the South Atlantic about 200 miles off the coast of the Falkland Islands, Spanish authorities said Wednesday.
    

            The fishing vessel, FV Argos Georgia, had 27 people onboard when it took on water and began sinking east of the islands on Monday. It requested assistance soon after at about 4 p.m. local time Monday, the Falkland Islands government said in press release Tuesday.
    

            The crew abandoned ship and some managed to board life rafts, the government said.
    

            Fourteen people survived the sinking with slight injuries, while authorities are continuing to search for the missing using maritime, air, and satellite resources.
    

            At least 10 of the crew members were identified as Spaniards, the Associated Press reported. Two of the deceased were from Spain’s Galicia region, the Government Delegation in Galicia said.
    

            Citing British and Spanish maritime authorities, the AP reported that the 14 known survivors had been rescued by nearby fishing boats.
    

            Those rescued were to be taken to the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital in the capital Stanley for medical assessments, according to the Falkland Islands government.
    

            The Falkland Islands said that a search and rescue helicopter had unsuccessfully attempted to rescue crew members on Monday evening but was thwarted due to “extremely challenging weather conditions and very limited time on scene due to range.”
    

            “The helicopter returned to Stanley Airport to refuel prior to a second attempt but the weather worsened further, and rotary wing SAR operations were suspended,” it added.
    

            In addition to the Falkland Islands government, the search and rescue operation involves the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, HQ British Forces South Atlantic Islands, the UK Maritime & Coastguard Agency, the management company of the fishing vessel, and other fishing vessels at sea.
    

            “The Falkland Islands government sends their thoughts to all the families involved,” it added.
    

            Argentina’s Navy said it had also attempted search and rescue operations after being alerted about the ship’s sinking.
    

            The Falkland Islands, which lie about 300 miles east of the tip of South America, are a British-ruled overseas territory over which Britain and Argentina fought a brief war in 1982. Britain won that war but Argentina continues to claim the islands, which it refers to as Las Malvinas.
    

            According to the AP, the Argos Georgia is managed by Argos Froyanes Ltd, a privately-owned joint British-Norwegian company, and was sailing under the flag of St Helena, another British overseas territories in the South Atlantic.
    

            “This accident highlights the harshness of fishing activity and the sacrifice and risk that sea professionals experience,” said Carmen Crespo, chair of the Committee on Fisheries, for the European Parliament in a statement on Tuesday.

CNN_38,US reality show contestant kills and eats protected bird in New Zealand,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/reality-show-protected-bird-new-zealand-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-24 12:33:00,world,"
            A reality show contestant who killed and ate a protected bird has been let off with a warning after New Zealand wildlife officials said cast members were tired, hungry and placed in a “unique” situation.
    

            Spencer “Corry” Jones, an American white water river guide, killed and ate the large, flightless weka during filming of “Race to Survive: New Zealand” last fall, CNN affiliate RNZ reported Tuesday.
    

            The weka, named on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species, is protected in mainland New Zealand, where the penalty for killing one is a prison sentence of up to two years or a fine of nearly $60,000.
    

            “Race to Survive” pits nine teams of two contestants in a 150-mile race across New Zealand’s harsh terrain, in which they must find their own food and water to compete for a $500,000 prize, according to USA Network, which airs the show.

            In a clip from the show, Jones apologizes and says he knew eating the weka was against the law, but he was desperate and hungry, RNZ reported.
    

            Jones and his teammate Oliver Dev were disqualified after the incident.
    

            CNN has reached out to Jones for comment.
    

            New Zealand’s Department of Conservation said following an investigation it had issued written warnings to Jones and the show’s producers – but stopped short of tougher action.
    

            “The unique set of circumstances – cast members were fatigued and suffering from significant hunger, in an unusual group dynamic situation – meant we felt a warning letter was prudent,” said Dylan Swain, the department’s team lead for investigations.
    

            “Nonetheless, killing and eating a native protected species in this matter is unacceptable and the company is ‘on notice’ about the need for its program participants to adhere to conservation legislation.”
    

            The weka has a “famously feisty and curious” personality, according to the department, and is known for its loud “coo-et” call, which is presented as a duet, with the male taking on the lower, slower part.
    

            “Weka are usually heard, not seen,” the department says on its website.
    

            Once widespread, its populations now fluctuate depending on food conditions, which had led to the bird’s legal protection in mainland New Zealand. The harvest of weka is legal on some of the country’s surrounding islands.
    

            Swain said the producers of “Race to Survive” had a permit to film on public conservation land and were aware that protected species and plants could not be harvested or eaten.
    

            In a statement, “Race to Survive” production said it alerted authorities as soon as they became aware of the weka incident.

            “Contestants were all thoroughly briefed ahead of time, and reminded throughout the competition, of all of New Zealand’s wildlife rules and guidelines,” its statement said.
    

            “It was determined that a contestant did in fact violate a rule, so appropriate action was taken, and the team was disqualified from the competition.”
    

            Jones and Dev were favored to win before they were pulled off the course, according to USA Network.
    

            New Zealand has a plethora of unique flora and fauna due to its long geological isolation from the supercontinent Gondwana, according to independent conservation organization Forest and Bird.
    

            This long isolation and the absence of mammalian predators means many native species are defenseless against attack – including flightless birds like the weka.

CNN_39,Israel is blocking physicians with Palestinian heritage from entering Gaza,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/middleeast/israel-restrictions-palestinian-doctors-gaza-cmd-intl/index.html,2024-07-24 12:00:00,world,"
            Palestinian-American doctor Jiab Suleiman arrived in Jordan last month ahead of an emergency medical mission into Gaza, which he was due to oversee. The Ohio-born orthopedic surgeon had already led two trips into the besieged strip since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October and was finalizing details for his third.
    

            But his preparation would ultimately be for nothing. The day before the team was set to cross into Gaza, Suleiman received notice that he had been denied entry by Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages policy for the Palestinian territories and the flow of aid into the strip.
    

            Suleiman’s denial is part of a policy recently communicated to medical missions going into Gaza through Israel. The restrictions block the entry of US healthcare workers, and those of other nationalities, if they are of Palestinian origin or have Palestinian heritage, according to internal memos from the World Health Organization (WHO) obtained by CNN.
    

            CNN spoke with doctors from several medical aid organizations who say the policy has forced them to avoid recruiting any medical workers with Palestinian background or ID on their trips. The rejections often come at the last minute, they say, leaving the groups with no time to fill the empty slots and forcing them to enter Gaza with an incomplete staff.
    

            “We have to actually tell people of Palestinian origin or Palestinian dual nationals that it is not possible for them to go in,” said Sameer Sah, director of programs at Medical Aid for Palestinians, an aid organization based in the United Kingdom. “We have to distinguish between Palestinians and non-Palestinians which is not ethically right, which is not right in terms of humanitarian laws, and it is not humane.”
    

            CNN reviewed WHO internal memos from early June describing the extent of what they call Israel’s new policy, in which aid groups were advised against bringing medical professionals with a Palestinian background – even if only through a parent or grandparent - on mission trips.
    

            “They said ‘you’re denied because of your Palestinian ID,’” said Suleiman, the medical mission lead at Rahma, a US-based humanitarian organization, referring to COGAT. “It’s very upsetting, annoying and disturbing to deny someone entry to a war zone to do a mission just because of the fact that they’re by genetics Palestinian.”
    

            “I stopped recruiting or encouraging any Palestinian physician worldwide to come help, I just can’t recruit them because I lose a slot,” Suleiman added. “Even if it’s just one doctor or one nurse, I lose a slot knowing that they’re going to be denied and I need every single body, every physician to go into Gaza.”
    

            The change in policy came after Israel launched a deadly ground offensive into Rafah in May, during which it seized control of the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza and destroyed the Palestinian side. Medical aid groups that relied on the Rafah crossing for entry into Gaza have been forced instead to use Kerem Shalom – a crossing previously used for commercial goods – to get from Israel into southern Gaza.
    

            Before the war, Palestinian medics and medics of Palestinian heritage who held other passports could apply to Israel for entry into Gaza and have no issues getting approval. They would enter the strip through the Erez crossing, between Israel and northern Gaza, which has been closed since it was destroyed in the Hamas-led attacks on October 7.
    

            Since the Rafah crossing was closed, Israel has further restricted the entry of medical supplies and limited the number of severely injured people who can leave Gaza. In March, a CNN investigation drawing on interviews with humanitarian and government officials, and documents compiled by aid groups, revealed items frequently rejected by Israel: anesthetics, oxygen cylinders, ventilators, medicines to treat cancer and maternity kits.
    

            International aid organizations are demanding that Israel drop the new restrictions affecting medical missions, pointing to the dire need for their teams to enter Gaza, which has had its healthcare system decimated by Israel’s war, launched in response to the Hamas-led attacks of October 7. Since then, more than 500 healthcare workers have been killed and 32 out of 36 hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN.
    

            In an email sent by a WHO regional office, teams were told that the new COGAT policy stated that anyone with Palestinian background or roots would be denied border crossing through Kerem Shalom.
    

            “We reiterate that we STRONGLY advice (sic) against any attempt of entering Gaza with a Palestinian background/roots,” the email stated.
    

            Another WHO email sent a few days later explained that rejections could also be simply due to ancestry, such as having “parents or grandparents who were born or formerly established in Palestine, with or even without Palestinian ID.”
    

            “We are having HUGE problems with this, as COGAT keeps rejecting many people for this reason,” the email said.
    

            In one WHO document from early June detailing updated guidance, aid groups were told that “it is not recommended that staff with dual citizenship (Palestinian) enter Gaza due to issues with permits.”
    

            When asked about its new policy, COGAT told CNN in a statement that efforts were being made to bring in medical teams and replacement personnel for hospitals. It did not directly address the question of whether medics with Palestinian roots were barred entry, but said, “Israel enables the international community to bring in medical teams with foreign workers subject to security considerations.”
    

            Thaer Ahmad, a Palestinian-American doctor from Chicago who went on a medical trip to Gaza in January, was in Cairo preparing for another trip in May when Israel seized the Rafah crossing, blocking humanitarian and medical aid groups from entering.
    

            “I find it so heartbreaking and tragic that any connection to the land is used against healthcare workers trying to help,” said Ahmad, who walked out of a White House meeting with Muslim community leaders in April in protest of the Biden administration’s support of the war. “To be deprived of being able to put my skills to use for my people, at the height of their suffering and pain is especially cruel.”
    

            The Palestinian American Medical Association (PAMA) told CNN it now requires applicants to disclose whether they have a Palestinian ID or roots, a move it says it has been forced to make.
    

            “Because of the limited amount of seats that we have, we can’t risk it,” said Dr. Mustafa Musleh, the president of PAMA. “It is not necessarily something that we want, and we really prefer not to do that. But I don’t think we have a choice at this point.”
    

            Another organization posted a recruiting ad on Instagram calling for surgeons to apply for its upcoming medical mission trip to Gaza. The ad disclosed that “applicants with a Palestinian ID or Palestinian roots are not allowed into Gaza.” The post has since been deleted.
    

            Musleh emphasized that there are significant advantages to including medical workers with the same background and roots as the populations they are treating in mission teams, since it means they can understand the language and culture.
    

            Palestinians have faced decades of tight restrictions on their movement by Israel, imposed through a complex system of permits, walls, checkpoints and border crossings. Unlike Israeli settlers – who can generally move freely without restriction – Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are required to obtain special permits from the Israeli government.
    

            According to B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, Palestinians face “an arbitrary, entirely non-transparent bureaucratic system” in which many permits are denied or revoked without explanation.
    

            For Palestinian doctors hoping to provide care for their people, Israel’s decision to deny them entry to Gaza has left them in despair.
    

            “Your hands are tied, and you feel hopeless,” Suleiman lamented. “I don’t understand these people, how they decide to do this to someone that’s just going in for two weeks to serve the purpose of helping people.”
    

            “It does not feel right being denied just because of the place you were born and being treated different than other US citizens,” Musleh said.

CNN_40,Beijing and Manila made a deal in the South China Sea. But they’re already at odds over what was agreed,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/asia/south-china-sea-deal-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-24 10:51:00,world,"
            An interim deal to smooth deliveries to Philippine marines marooned on a ship at a hotly disputed reef in the South China Sea appears to be in doubt after Manila and Beijing gave opposing accounts over what they had agreed to.
    

            Fears of a conflict with global implications have risen in recent months following a series of increasingly violent clashes between Chinese coast guard vessels and Philippine ships at Second Thomas Shoal in the contested Spratly Islands, where Manila grounded a navy ship in 1999 to press its claims.
    

            Following de-escalation talks, Manila and Beijing both said they had reached a “provisional arrangement” on the resupply of necessities to Philippine marines stationed aboard the BRP Sierra Madre – without either side conceding their maritime claims.
    

            But analysts were skeptical about whether the temporary deal would hold after the two sides provided conflicting details of what their agreement entails.
    

            Here’s what you need to know.
    

            Neither Manila nor Beijing has released the text of the temporary agreement reached on Sunday to cool tensions at the reef, known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren’ai Jiao in China, which is located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan.
    

            A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing had agreed to allow Manila to resupply its personnel on the Sierra Madre with living necessities “in a humanitarian spirit.”
    

            Those resupply missions could only take place “if the Philippines informs China in advance and after on-site verification is conducted,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular news briefing.
    

            “China will monitor the entire resupply process,” she added.
    

            Those remarks met pushback in Manila.
    

            The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a statement on X that the country would continue to assert its rights in the South China Sea, noting the provisional agreement with Beijing had been reached “without compromising national positions.”
    

            Therefore, the Chinese statement “regarding prior notification and on-site confirmation is inaccurate,” the DFA said.
    

            The Philippines made the deal in good faith, was ready to implement it, and urged China to do the same, the statement added.
    

            Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.
    

            In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.
    

            China has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia and coastguard vessels to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
    

            Under President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations off the Philippine islands.

            They include standoffs between Chinese boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese attempts to block the resupply of the BRP Sierra Madre with water cannons; and a bold move by a lone Filipino diver armed with a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier.
    

            In a major escalation on June 17, the Philippines and China blamed each other for a clash near Second Thomas Shoal in which a Philippine serviceman lost a thumb.
    

            Footage released by the Philippine military showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called “a brazen act of aggression.”
    

            The clash took place just weeks after President Marcos warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be “very close” to an act of war.
    

            The resource-rich South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and Western observers say tensions could erupt if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.
    

            Washington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.
    

            The US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing free passage through seas worldwide.
    

            The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is “defending every nation’s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”
    

            Beijing denounces such operations as illegal.
    

            In remarks at the Aspen Security Forum on July 19, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the United States would “continue to support the Philippines and stand behind them as they take steps” to resupply the Sierra Madre.
    

            “The most important thing right now is to see de-escalation and to see the ability of the Philippines to do resupplies. We believe that is achievable, and we’re going to drive to make that happen,” Sullivan said.
    

            Analysts have cast doubt on whether the temporary deal between Manila and Beijing will ever be implemented.
    

            Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said both sides may have withheld the written details to allow them to save face – and their differing interpretations could undermine the agreement.
    

            “We’ll only know for sure when we see how China reacts to the next Philippine resupply mission,” he said.
    

            “If the resupply gets through unmolested despite the fact that the Philippines certainly won’t tell China in advance or allow any inspection of the cargo, then that will be a victory for Manila’s strategy over the last two years. And it will certainly be a relief to the United States.”
    

            Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the US-based RAND Corporation think tank, said the deal did not address the underlying territorial disputes and appeared to have failed before it had even started.
    

            “The China-Philippines deal is already falling apart, probably because Beijing wishes to keep the appearance of diplomatic engagement while continuing to uphold its bottom line interests – a low-risk and highly effective strategy,” he said.

CNN_41,Erdogan courts ‘terrorist’ Assad amid pressure to solve Turkey’s ‘Syrian problem’,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/middleeast/erdogan-assad-turkey-syrian-refugees-mime-intl/index.html,2024-07-24 21:29:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.


            It’s been well over a decade since millions of Syrians flooded into Turkey en masse, seeking refuge from the civil war at home. But today, there are increasing signs the refugees may have worn out their welcome.
    

            This month, anti-Syrian riots took place in several cities across the country. In the capital Ankara, opposition parties are calling for mass deportations, and the government is calling on the Syrian regime it once sought to topple to help resolve the problem.

Syrians in Turkey fear the worst as Erdogan changes tune on Assad


            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now publicly seeking a meeting with President Bashar al-Assad, the man he once labeled a terrorist, to reset relations. Before the Syrian civil war, the two leaders vacationed together, but years later, after the Syrian regime brutally crushed a public revolt, Erdogan sought to oust him from office and backed local forces fighting against him.
    

            “We believe that it is beneficial to open clenched fists,” Erdogan said this month. “We want disputes to be resolved through mutual dialogue at the negotiation table.”
    

            Turkey is hosting an estimated 3.1 million Syrian refugees – more than any other country. Unofficial estimates are much higher, given that undocumented refugees aren’t counted.
    

            But overcoming a bitter, years-long personal feud and extremely complex relations between Ankara and Damascus will be no small feat. Turkish troops remain in control of a swath of Syrian territory along the Turkish border where Syrian opposition groups are sheltering.
    

            For Erdogan, “immigration and refugees are the main concern,” said Bilal Bagis, an analyst at the government-leaning SETA think tank in Ankara. “It’s becoming a political argument against the incumbent government in Turkey… and it definitely has turned into something that needs to be resolved.”
    

            Assad has long made clear that there will only be a meeting when Turkey withdraws troops from Syria, although he indicated this week that he would meet if the topic was at least on the agenda.
    

            “If the meeting leads to results, or if there’s a hug, a scolding, or even cheek-kissing that serves the country’s interest, I will do it,” Assad said. “The problem is not in the meeting itself but in the content of the meeting.”
    

            While there are no signs that Turkey would withdraw from Syria or drop its support for the Syrian opposition, the olive branch from Ankara indicates the pressure Erdogan is under to deal with the discontent at home.
    

            This month, reports of a Syrian man sexually abusing his seven-year-old Syrian cousin sparked riots and violence in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri, with Turks targeting Syrian-owned businesses and cars.

            The government blamed social media for fueling the unrest, which quickly spread to other cities. In Antalya, a teenager was killed and in Istanbul, an Arab man was threatened with a knife at a restaurant in an upscale part of the city. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said hundreds of people were arrested in the aftermath.
    

            The riots exposed long-simmering tensions between Syrians and Turks that have been made worse by the economic pressures brought by Turkey’s sky-high inflation.
    

            Unlike European nations, where Syrian refugees are being permanently resettled, most Syrians in Turkey are treated as “guests” with temporary protection and are subject to a number of restrictions.
    

            Most Syrians cannot travel freely within the country. Fewer than 10% of Syrian adults have work permits, with the rest being limited to informal, under-the-table jobs. Untold numbers of Syrian children are not in school, either because they work or face difficulty enrolling due to rules requiring them to attend schools in the areas where they were initially registered. Only a small proportion of Syrians have been granted citizenship in the country of 85 million.
    

            Many Turks complain that Syrians have failed to integrate, but Syrians argue their host country hasn’t made it easy.
    

            “Integration depends on two things: effort on the part of migrants, and for citizens of the country to accept them as part of society… but right now there is no acceptance of Syrians in Turkey,” said Ebubekir Hussamoglu, a Syrian who arrived in the country just before war broke out at home, forcing him to stay. He’s now a legal consultant and a Turkish citizen. His biography bears little resemblance to the average Syrian in Turkey, who is often at the low end of the economic and social ladder.
    

            “These people have been working in Turkey for about ten years and are receiving lower wages and they are not getting their social rights, social security. This doesn’t make them feel secure here in the long run,” he said.
    

            Recent deportee Mohammad Shbeeb says his existence in Turkey was anything but secure. He first arrived at the border in 2018, and says he was promptly detained and sent back. He says he was threatened with indefinite detention if he didn’t sign a document agreeing to voluntarily return. Many other Syrians have similar stories.
    

            Abdullah Resul Demir, president of International Refugee Rights Association, a volunteer-led NGO helping Syrians navigate the legalities of immigration, says some people have had to leave their families behind in Turkey when they’re deported. “We have faced many examples like that,” he said.

For Syrian refugees, Assad’s rehabilitation prompts fear of forced return


            The Turkish interior ministry said such claims are unfounded and unacceptable.
    

            “Syrians under temporary protection in our country only return to their country voluntarily, safely and with dignity,” the ministry told CNN in a statement. “Voluntary returns to safe areas in northern Syria are currently continuing, and to date, more than 678,000 Syrians have returned to their country in this way.”
    

            For Shbeeb, two weeks after being returned, he smuggled himself back into Turkey, but was never able to get papers to officially stay. Earlier this month, he said he was picked up by immigration authorities on his way home from work in the city of Gaziantep, and promptly deported once again. All of his belongings are still in his Turkish apartment. He is now staying with a friend in Azaz, northwestern Syria. Ankara says the city is in a safe zone controlled by Turkish troops. But Shbeeb says it’s far from safe.
    

            “There is bombing, sometimes from (US-backed Syrian opposition forces) or from even the (Assad) regime…. so no, it’s not a safe area at all,” he said.
    

            Shbeeb says it wasn’t easy to integrate in Turkey, but he tried anyway. He had a well-paying job in Gaziantep (he now works remotely for the same company), he learned Turkish and made Turkish friends.
    

            “Turkish people didn’t accept the integration of Syrians in their society. I think they suffer from fear of others – Arabs, Europeans, anyone who is not a Turk,” he said. “In six years, I didn’t feel like this society could accept me.”
    

            Integration of Syrians has been a failure, according to Cenk Ozatici, deputy chairman of the secular, nationalist opposition Iyi (Good) Party. The party advocated the creation of conditions inside Syria that are safe enough to send back all Syrian asylum-seekers. Ozatici says the government never really planned for Syrians to stay long term, and the sheer volume of people meant integration was always impossible.
    

            “It’s impossible because of cultural differences and historical issues. It’s even impossible sometimes, because of the difference in the interpretation of Islam. I know that many Western powers sometimes just think ‘you are Muslim, they are Muslim, so what’s the problem?’, but it’s not like that,” he said.
    

            Ozatici believes that because many Syrians end up living in what he describes as “ghettos,” and because Turkish birth rates are so low, and asylum-seeker birth rates so high, “the demographic structure and identity of Turkish society is under threat.”
    

            He is critical of a 2016 deal Turkey signed with the European Union that saw Ankara agree to take back migrants who crossed into Europe. He’s not alone. To varying degrees, most mainstream political parties in Turkey believe the solution lies in returning asylum-seekers to Syria.
    

            One of Erdogan’s most famous and formidable political rivals is Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In an interview with CNN in April, the mayor said he believes there are 2.5 million Syrians in Istanbul alone – five times the official estimate – and way beyond what’s manageable.
    

            “The solution should be found in Syria, by negotiating with the regime in Syria,” he said. “I care about Syrian women and children here, because ultimately they are humans. But I also care about my country and my city.”

CNN_42,Pilot sole survivor of Nepal plane crash that killed 18,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/nepal-saurya-airline-plane-crash-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-24 17:54:00,world,"
            At least 18 people were killed after a small plane skidded off the runway in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu on Wednesday, local officials said.
    

            The pilot, who has been hospitalized, is the sole survivor of the Saurya Airlines crash, said Gyanendra Bhul, a spokesperson for Tribhuvan International Airport. All those on board - 18 Nepalis and a Yemeni citizen - were employees of the carrier, according to police.
    

            Images from Nepal police showed thick smoke billowing from the burning aircraft on the the airport runway.
    

            The aircraft crashed during takeoff from Kathmandu to the city of Pokhara around 11 a.m. local time, Bhul said. The plane was en route for technical maintenance, he added.
    

            “Rescue efforts were started immediately and the situation was brought under control,” the aviation authority said.
    

            The crash once again highlights the dangers of air travel in Nepal, a country often referred to as one of the riskiest places to fly due to multiple factors including its mountainous terrain.
    

            The Himalayan country, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains including Everest, has a record of air accidents. Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.
    

            Aircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.
    

            While the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.
    

            Last year, Nepal saw its worst plane crash in more than 30 years when at least 68 people died when a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara.
    

            In May 2022, a Tara Air flight departing from Pokhara crashed into a mountain, killing 22 people.
    

            In early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.
    

            And in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the 2023 crash.

CNN_43,North Korea’s trash balloons fall near South’s presidential office,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-presidential-compound-intl-hnk/index.html,2024-07-24 13:43:00,world,"
            Trash-laden North Korean balloons were found on the grounds of South Korea’s presidential office compound, officials said Wednesday, the latest in a series of incidents that have raised tensions and rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula.
    

            More than 3,000 North Korean balloons, often filled with garbage such as cigarette butts, discarded batteries and even manure have fallen in the South since May, according to South Korean officials – who have responded by resuming loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda and entertainment like K-pop songs along the demilitarized zone (DMZ).
    

            The discovery at the presidential office Wednesday came after South Korean authorities warned the public to beware of falling objects as suspected North Korean trash balloons moved south toward the northern area of Gyeonggi province.
    

            “While monitoring trash balloons sent by North Korea in cooperation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff today, we identified trash that fell in the presidential office area in Yongsan,” the presidential security service said later in a statement.
    

            “No harmful or contaminating substances were found from an analysis by the response team.”
    

            South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) has advised people not to touch fallen balloons and to report any found to authorities.

            “North Korea’s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,” JCS said in a statement after an earlier balloon incident. “All responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.”
    

            Pyongyang has previously said it sent balloons south in response to a civilian campaign in South Korea to float balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda in the opposite direction.
    

            For many years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to the North, loaded with material criticizing dictator Kim Jong Un and USB sticks filled with K-pop songs and South Korean television shows – all strictly prohibited in the impoverished, highly isolated nation.
    

            In a statement carried by North Korean state media earlier this month, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of the North Korean leader, said dozens of balloons, “dirty leaflets” and other material sent from South Korea were again found in her country and near the border.
    

            Despite repeated North Korean warnings, the South Korean activists were “not stopping this crude and dirty play” she said.

            “It seems that the situation we cannot overlook is coming,” Kim Yo Jong said in a “stern warning” published by North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), adding there would be “a gruesome and dear price” to pay that could change the South’s “mode of counteraction” with the North.
    

            While the balloons have been going across the border, North Korea has kept up a stream of criticism against military drills by the United States and South Korea on the peninsula, the latest of those being the deployment of US Marine Corps F/A-18 and F-35B fighter jets to Suwon Air Base for joint aerial training this week.
    

            The South Korean Defense Ministry said the US planes will join with South Korean F-15, F-16 and FA-50 fighters in exercises that will end August 8.
    

            A US Defense Department release said the Marine Corps jets were dispatched “to enhance their standard of readiness and lethality with our South Korean allies and joint forces.”
    

            But a KCNA commentary claimed the joint maneuvers were an example of Washington “running high fever in its move to expand the overall structure of confrontation against” North Korea.
    

            North and South Korea have been divided since 1953, when an armistice ended the Korean War three years after the North invaded the South. But a peace treaty has never been signed, so the two technically remain at war.

CNN_45,"This word is the ‘key’ to being treated well in France, experts say",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/paris-france-etiquette/index.html,2024-07-24 19:27:00,world,"
            If there’s one thing Parisians want tourists to know before millions of people descend on their city for the Olympics, it’s a simple, seven-letter word.
    

            “Bonjour.”


            Knowing how to say “hello” in French might seem like a no-brainer, but experts say it’s the essential first step if you want to make a good impression. Take it from a former US expat who lived there.
    

            “If you’re going to France and you don’t start off all your interactions with ‘bonjour,’ you may be in for a little bit of a rude awakening,” says Elisabeth Guenette, who regularly shares language tips and cultural insights from her time teaching both in France and in the US with her 150,000-plus followers on social media.
    

            And the locals back her up. Asking for help? While “excuse me” might be an acceptable way to get someone’s attention in the US, in France it would be considered overly abrupt and rude.
    

            “Starting with ‘bonjour’ will already drastically change your experience,’ Guenette says. “That is the No. 1 rule.”
    

            And that rule applies whether you’re checking into a hotel, buying a baguette or making a restaurant reservation, says Countess Marie de Tilly, a French etiquette coach whose clients include brands like Chanel and Cartier.
    

            “If you don’t say ‘bonjour,’” de Tilly explains, restaurant staff “won’t work too hard to book a table for you. It’s the key.”
    

            Guenette says the same expectation applies if you’re simply walking into a store, even if you’re just casually browsing for souvenirs and not necessarily looking for help from the staff.
    

            “This is a difference with American culture,” says Guenette. In France, “any store where you walk in and you can see the people who work there, you need to greet them.”
    

            The differences don’t stop there. Here’s what else you need to know to save yourself from making a major faux pas in France.
    

            Just like “hello” is essential for starting off on the right foot, knowing how to say goodbye is equally important. That’s “au revoir,” but if you want to switch it up, you could also say “bonne journée” (Have a nice day) or “bonne soirée” (Have a good night) if it’s evening.
    

            Speaking a few words in French can go a long way, Guenette says.
    

            “Knowing a tiny bit of French to begin your conversations shows that you are respecting their culture,” she says.

Paris adds an unusual museum to its illustrious roster


            Three words she suggests learning: “Parlez-vous anglais?” (Do you speak English?)
    

            “They most likely will speak English,” she says, but it’s important not to assume.
    

            Be willing to try to speak in French, even if you might make a mistake, says Marie de Tilly.
    

            “It’s exactly the same when I go to the US… I can try to speak English,” she says.
    

            So, if you’re willing to try to speak French, here are few more terms to know:
    

S’il vous plaît: Please


Merci: Thank you


Pardon/Excusez-moi: Excuse me


            It’s not about perfect pronunciation, but rather about showing respect for the country you’re visiting, de Tilly says.
    

            “People want to see that you make an effort.”
    

            In a country renowned for its cuisine, “meals are sacred,” Guenette says.
    

            While taking 15 or 20 minutes to eat a quick meal is fairly common in the US, that’s not typically the case in France, where historically it’s been illegal to eat your lunch at your desk.
    

            Instead, workers often take advantage of the “formule du jour,” a two- or three-course meal deal advertised on chalkboards outside of countless Paris bistros.
    

            “Meals are a precious time, and they take time,” Guennette explains. Your meal “is going to take more than just half an hour and they’re not going to be rushing things to you.”
    

            Service also looks different in France, Guenette says.
    

            “The waiter will not be regularly coming over to your table” to ask how everything is. “You have to very much make eye contact or signal to them to let them know you want them to come to you,” she says.
    

            And France’s tipping culture reflects that. Tips are appreciated, but generally not expected.
    

            “There’s no additional motivation for them to win you over,” Guenette says. “They expect to be treated like a person, and they’re going to treat you like a person.”
    

            If you have the time for a sitdown meal, Guenette highly recommends eating at one of Paris’ iconic sidewalk cafés. Unless a table has a reserved sign or already has cutlery on it, in most cases you can seat yourself. Otherwise, you’ll want to walk inside and ask the staff for a table, Guennette says.
    

            “And yes, you do sit next to each other,” she explains. As opposed to being seated across the table from your companion, this way, everyone can face the street and participate in another quintessentially Parisian pastime: people-watching.
    

            “That is something I always recommend when people go to France: Just sit and relax,” she says. “Even if you don’t have that much time, take an hour because that is the true French experience.”
    

            But during the Olympics, securing a coveted reservation is likely to be a bit more complicated. Since the crowds of tourists will be even bigger than usual this summer, Marie de Tilly recommends booking a table in advance if there’s a specific restaurant or rooftop bar you’re hoping to visit. De Tilly also notes that mealtimes are another area where France diverges from the US: Dinner service usually doesn’t start until 7 p.m.
    

            As an etiquette coach, observing other people is a big part of de Tilly’s job – and there’s one trend that seriously concerns her.
    

            “I’m very surprised to see young foreigners that don’t know how to use a fork and a knife,” she says. “When you go to a nice restaurant in Paris, it’s awful to see that.”
    

            It’s important to have basic knowledge of the local culture and its traditions, de Tilly says – like the fact that foods you might be used to eating with your hands, such as hamburgers and pizza, are commonly eaten with a fork and knife in France.
    

            If you don’t want to attract unwanted attention in a restaurant, there are a few more things you can try to blend in.
    

First, keep the volume down.


            “Every country you go to will have a different standard of volume for conversation,” Guenette says. “France is definitely on the lower end.”
    

            If you speak too loudly in a public place, whether a restaurant, a museum or the Metro, “you will get looks,” she says.
    

            Guenette learned this the hard way years ago, when she was at a particularly boisterous dinner with fellow teachers from the US and the UK.

            “All of a sudden, we hear ‘clink clink clink,’” from another table, she recalls, as if for a Champagne toast. Instead, what they heard in the silence that followed was an audible sigh of relief from a Frenchwoman across the restaurant.
    

            “I was embarrassed,” Guenette says. “I am in somebody else’s ‘house,’ somebody else’s culture, and there are things I can do to show respect for the fact that this does not belong to me.”
    

            One more way to show your respect: If you’re wearing a hat, take it off before you go inside, Guenette says.
    

            “Historically America used to be like this, too, but times have changed,” she points out.
    

            Expressing curiosity is a simple way to show your appreciation for the culture of the country you’re visiting, especially as a first-time visitor, Marie de Tilly says.
    

            “It’s very important to ask some questions … to show respect and show your interest,” de Tilly says. “What is very important and elegant is to ask people, what are the traditions?”
    

            So, even if you have a fully planned itinerary for your trip or have an idea of which wine you want to order with dinner, don’t be afraid to ask locals for their advice. You might end up discovering a museum off the beaten path or a new favorite wine pairing.
    

            Personal questions, however, are frowned upon – even ones that might seem standard in your home country.
    

            “If you are around my table for example [and] we are invited to the same dinner, I will not ask for the first time, ‘Are you married? Do you have children?’” de Tilly says.
    

            Similarly, you won’t want to go right in for the classic cheek kiss, or bises, if you’re just meeting someone for the first time, Guenette says. That’s reserved for friends and friends of friends. If you don’t know someone personally, say “Enchanté” (Nice to meet you) and introduce yourself.
    

            “Definitely don’t go to a restaurant and do the bises to your waiter,” she says. “That would be very inappropriate.”
    

            Also inappropriate? Discussing politics at the dinner table – especially after the country’s recent elections.
    

            “It’s really touchy because there’s two extremes, the right and the left,” de Tilly says.
    

            If you don’t want to stick out, here are a few more things to keep in mind.
    

            When you’re taking the Metro to get around the city, hold onto your ticket as proof of purchase until you’ve exited the Metro station at your destination, Guenette says. If you lose it, you may be on the hook for a big fine. According to the official website for public transport in Paris, getting caught without your Metro ticket could cost you up to 100 euros ($109) on top of what you already paid in the first place.
    

            If you want to make things a bit easier on yourself, Metro passes are also available for purchase and may save you some money.
    

            Next, eating on the go isn’t widely accepted.
    

            “You’ll stick out,” Guennette says.
    

            So if you decide to buy a homemade sandwich from a food stall in one of Paris’ covered markets, resist the temptation to dig in while walking to your next destination. Instead, find a spot to sit down away from the city’s bustling sidewalks – for example, a bench in the quiet Square du Temple - Elie Wiesel, the rolling hills of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, or the banks of the Canal Saint-Martin.
    

            The same goes for lugging around a big water bottle.
    

            “It’s not common,” Guenette says. “And it’s usually tourists” who do it.
    

            But standing out doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing, Guenette says.
    

            “Do whatever you want, just be aware that if you do this thing, people will know that you’re a tourist,” she says. “And sometimes, who cares?”
    

            Born into one of the oldest families in French aristocracy, de Tilly is an expert on savoir-vivre, or good manners. By her own definition, that means understanding how to coexist with people around you, no matter how different or similar you may be – and she’s made it her mission to teach foreigners and the French alike how to do just that.
    

            Etiquette, however, is about much more than “please” and “thank you” in de Tilly’s eyes. One of her areas of expertise is training employees of luxury brands on how to receive customers in their stores.
    

            “When you come for the first time into Chanel, even if you don’t have money… you have the right to a good welcome,” she says.

Parisian cafés are a cherished part of French culture. Here’s why they might be in trouble


            In the same spirit, de Tilly says she hopes the French will give a warm welcome to tourists in town for the Olympics, even though locals complained when Paris was first selected to host the Games.
    

            “We said it could be awful for traffic,” she says. “I’m living in the center of Paris, and you can’t imagine the mess.”
    

            But now, she says Parisians see that their city is ready for its moment on the world stage. She’s even looking for tickets herself.
    

            “I hope with all my heart that it will be a success,” she says. “We need it now because the mindset for French people is very difficult because of all the politics.”
    

            In Guenette’s experience, the stereotype of the rude Parisian is an exaggeration.
    

            “A lot of it comes down to not having a common societal understanding of the politeness expectations,” she says. “If you are able to go into these situations understanding what their expectations are, people are much more willing to engage with you.”
    

            She points out that most people don’t take kindly to rudeness, no matter where you’re from.
    

            “If they feel like you’re being rude to them, it makes sense that they are then going to kind of reciprocate that,” she says.
    

            Ultimately, de Tilly says, French people are proud of their culture – and that pride can sometimes be taken for arrogance.
    

            “French people love their way of life,” she says. “And I think it’s so important that people come to France to see that.”

            The Biscuit Basin area of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is closed following a hydrothermal explosion Tuesday morning, park officials said in a news release and post on X.
    

            Biscuit Basin, its parking lot and boardwalks – about 2 miles northwest of the Old Faithful geyser – are temporarily closed for safety reasons, officials added in the post.
    

            No injuries were reported after the incident, which occurred near the Sapphire Pool around 10 a.m. local time. Investigators have yet to determine how much damage has occurred.
    

            “Hydrothermal explosions are violent and dramatic events resulting in the rapid ejection of boiling water, steam, mud, and rock fragments,” according to the US Geological Survey.
    

            They “occur where shallow interconnected reservoirs of fluids with temperatures at or near the boiling point underlie thermal fields. These fluids can rapidly transition to steam if the pressure suddenly drops. Since vapor molecules take up much more space than liquid molecules, the transition to steam results in significant expansion and blows apart surrounding rocks and ejects debris,” the agency says.

            The park has experienced such explosions in the past.
    

            “Porkchop Geyser, in Norris Geyser Basin, experienced an explosion in 1989, and a small event in Norris Geyser Basin was recorded by monitoring equipment on April 15, 2024. An explosion similar to that of today also occurred in Biscuit Basin on May 17, 2009,” a joint release from the park and the USGS said.
    

            But today’s explosion does not indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent, the release added: “Monitoring data show no changes in the Yellowstone region. Today’s explosion does not reflect activity within (the) volcanic system, which remains at normal background levels of activity. Hydrothermal explosions like that of today are not a sign of impending volcanic eruptions, and they are not caused by magma rising towards the surface.”
    

            Large hydrothermal explosions occur on an average of every 700 years, the USGS says.
    

            “Although large hydrothermal explosions are rare events on a human time scale, the potential for additional future events of the sort in Yellowstone National Park is not insignificant. Based on the occurrence of large hydrothermal explosion events over the past 16,000 years, an explosion large enough to create a 100-(meter)- (328-ft-) wide crater might be expected every few hundred years,” it added.

            Now underwater, the marble floor would originally have been located in the “protiro,” or decorated porch, of a residence overlooking the sea, according to a Facebook post from the Campi Flegrei Archaeological Park, which is part of the Italian Ministry of Culture, published Tuesday.
    

            Built in the ancient spa town of Baiae, which was popular during the late Roman Empire and home to residences owned by Julius Caesar and the Emperor Nero, the villa is part of an area of land that became submerged as the result of a geological phenomenon called bradyseism, during which the ground rises or, as in this case, falls due to pressure under the surface.
    

            Preliminary research shows that the floor is largely made of irregularly shaped pieces of reused marble, a technique that was common from the 3rd to the 5th century CE, according to the park.

            The marble is also broken up because the walls of the room, which were more than 10 meters (32 feet) high, collapsed onto the floor, it added.
    

            Underwater work continues to uncover and restore more of the floor, while some sections have been removed and cleaned on land.
    

            The aim is to try to reconstitute an entire section of the floor, according to the post.
    

            Local mayor Josi Gerardo Della Ragione called the find “stupendous” in a post on Facebook.
    

            The floor would have been laid toward the end of the Roman Empire, “shortly before bradyseism brought these wonders to the bottom of the sea,” he said.
    

            The area is now a popular diving spot, offering opportunities to see submerged ruins.
    

            Campi Flegrei, or the Phlegraean Fields – a large, volcanic area that stretches 200 kilometers (125 miles) under the bay of Naples and the islands of Capri and Ischia to the outskirts of the city of Naples – is a giant caldera, or depression.
    

            It is now the site of multiple volcanoes that have been active for 39,000 years, many of which lie underwater.
    

            The last major eruption of Campi Flegrei was in 1538, and it created a new mountain in the bay.
    

            Seismic activity in the area has been intensifying since December 2022, according to Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV), and experts fear the volcano could be reawakening after generations at rest.

CNN_48,Look of the week: Gigi Hadid’s midriff-baring look revives a 2000s fashion staple,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/style/gigi-hadid-midriff-top-lotw/index.html,2024-07-24 19:44:00,world,"
    Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.


            When Gigi Hadid stepped onto the “Deadpool & Wolverine” red carpet premiere in New York on Monday, she dusted off a Y2K summer staple, sporting a yellow triangle top bound to give any millennial an immediate flashback (and possibly a hot flash).
    

            If crop tops could talk, the triangle — also known as a handkerchief or bandana top — is the one most likely to gossip about you behind your back, and serves as a sure-fire signal of sex appeal and cool-girl status.
    

            Famously worn by Beyoncé and Jennifer Aniston, the triangle top was inherently Brat two decades before “Brat girl summer” was officially coined. A quintessential going-out top, it evoked a sense of effortlessness; you were so hot, you could simply tie a hair accessory around yourself as a shirt and pull it off. The triangle spawned offshoots too — its sister, the scarf top, was suggestively tied into a bra by Christina Aguilera.
    

            True to the legend of the aughts, Hadid styled the minimal fabric maximally with a matching yellow low-slung knee-length skirt and peeping black underwear, a super-wide brown belt and equally wide stacked bangles, pointed black pumps and a color-coordinated charmed-out handbag. The matchy-yet-busy Miu Miu ensemble (all in leather, which is having a sweaty moment this summer) was a perfect time-capsule of yesteryear, with internet commenters on Reddit dubbing it “Fergalicious,” referring to  the singer Fergie’s distinctive application of millennium style.

            But while Hadid’s triangle top stood out for its nostalgic appeal, the style has lurked on the fashion periphery in recent years as crop tops have remained a fixture. Emily Ratajowski, Bella Hadid and Sydney Sweeney have all worn variations on the style, with Kylie Jenner repping the same Miu Miu top and skirt set as Hadid’s in black last month.
    

            Joined by her friend Blake Lively on the red carpet (clad in a lacy red Versace catsuit), Hadid’s look was meant to be a coordination of sorts, the hues evoking the signature colors of the franchise’s titular superheroes, played by Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, with Lively’s a more on-the-nose interpretation of Deadpool’s predilection for spandex.
    

            But the appearance also marked a shift in the now ubiquitous world of premiere ‘method dressing’ for top-billed actors.  — in New York, Reynolds and Jackman wore black suits, leaving it to Lively and Hadid (neither appear in the film) to pick up the theme. Perhaps reluctant to get too coordinated, a la the classic looks of Destiny’s Child, the result was ultimately discordant, with silhouettes and materials at odds, carefully avoiding the trap of looking too ketchup and mustard.
    

            Though triangle tops are meant to seem easy and breezy, they can be a nuisance for small and large breasts alike; they’re also impractical anywhere there’s wind or an air conditioner. For that reason, Hadid hopefully had a jacket in tow for the chilly indoor theater — perhaps the translucent trench she changed into for the after party, also in Wolverine yellow.

CNN_49,This Madagascan artist is sending her paintings to the moon,https://edition.cnn.com/style/tara-shakti-moon-lunar-codex-spc/index.html,2024-07-24 17:21:00,world,"
            From a young age, award-winning artist Tara Shakti knew she wanted to pursue a career creating paintings that empowered other women. What she didn’t predict was that her work would one day be launched to the moon as a lasting memorial to human creativity.
    

            Growing up in Madagascar, off the eastern coast of southern Africa, Shakti was raised by a family of artists and was encouraged by her older brother to begin painting with bold colors at just seven years of age. Inspired by the intricacies of Renaissance paintings, she went on to pursue her passion for painting Accademia d’Arte in Florence, eventually moving to Paris to study the art market at the Drouot Auction House.
    

            Shakti’s work sheds light on pressing issues such as human trafficking and systemic oppression. “Growing up and seeing how women are mistreated, it filled my conscience,” she told CNN. “I want to use my art to highlight issues about women. I hope to raise voices to do something to help people.”
    

            Shakti is one of 35,000 contemporary artists, writers, poets, podcasters, sculptors, musicians and filmmakers from across the globe whose work is being sent up to the moon via the Lunar Codex project.
    

            The initiative will launch work from 247 countries, indigenous nations, and territories divided across six time capsules that will be sent to the moon over 18 months. The first successful launch was onboard the Intuitive Machines Odysseus lander via a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and landed in the lunar south pole last February. Another three were successfully launched earlier this year.
    

            Self-funding the Lunar Codex is Canadian physicist, artist and entrepreneur Dr. Samuel Peralta, who describes the project as a “message-in-a-bottle archival medium to showcase the beauty of human creativity.” Peralta, who is also chairman of Toronto-based media and technology company Incandence, hopes the project will become a global endeavor to champion underrepresented perspectives. The main criterion for nomination is that artists’ work should have been included in a curated exhibit, collection, anthology or similar.
    

            The cultural artifacts are copied onto digital memory cards or inscribed into dime-sized nickel-based Nanofiche, an analogue format that can be read with a microscope and store up to 150,000 pages of text or photos on a single 8.5 by 11-inch sheet. This high-density storage medium is designed to last for billions of years on the moon. The Nanofiche is then sealed and bolted onto the lunar lander before its launch.
    

            “You could think of us as a ride share with NASA,” said Peralta, explaining the Astrobotic Griffin lunar lander launching Shakti’s art will carry NASA’s VIPER rover as its main payload, with the Lunar Codex one of several secondary payloads onboard.
    

            Five of Shakti’s paintings will be included in the Codex Polaris time capsule, which will be launched on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket onboard the Astrobotic Griffin lunar lander in February 2025.
    

            Shakti’s work has already received international recognition. She was honored with the Mosaic 2019 Exposé Award in New York for her series “Archives,” received the Leonardo da Vinci Award in Florence, in February 2022, and was awarded the Medal of Recognition from the Embassy of Madagascar later that year.
    

            The artist was invited by Peralta to submit her work for the project after he discovered her paintings through social media earlier this year.
    

            “To have my work launched to the moon is an honor of immeasurable magnitude,” Shakti told CNN in an email. “It is a landmark achievement not only for myself but for the broader Malagasy (Madagascan) art community and reaffirms the significance of my heritage and the stories I strive to share through my art.
    

            “I want to introduce people to Madagascar, my homeland. How we are, how we behave, our traditions and our clothing. The country is twice the size of France, for example – so there is lots of culture,” she said.
    

            Among Shakti’s selected paintings is a large-format work titled “The Keepers of the Lost Wisdom,” which depicts the knowledge and strength passed down through generations of Malagasy women. Also going to the moon will be her painting titled “La Reine,” (The Queen, in English) which she says emphasizes the complexities and beauty of the feminine experience. Another piece, “Astrochelys Radiata,” highlights Madagascar’s unique biodiversity.
    

            “While living and working in Paris, Tara Shakti’s incorporation of traditional Malagasy themes in modernist compositions establish a unique voice in contemporary art archived in the Lunar Codex collection,” said Peralta.
    

            Although Shakti is currently the only confirmed Malagasy artist whose work will be featured, Peralta encourages artists from Madagascar and elsewhere to submit their portfolio for review and possible inclusion, which is free of charge.
    

            Other artists whose work has already been launched as part of the Lunar Codex project include Ada Limón, the current U.S. poet laureate, who wrote a poem for NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft bound for Jupiter in October, and Didi Mendez, a Cuban American artist and curator whose work was included in the successful February launch.
    

            “The real power of the Lunar project is to inspire artists of today. If they’re toiling in obscurity and wondering whether their work will amount to anything, now they can be sure of their work’s immortality,” Peralta said. “After all, why are we making art if not to leave it for the future, to have a part of ourselves that will last even after we’re done?”

CNN_50,Hundreds of people may have died from heat in one Arizona county,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/weather/phoenix-arizona-heat-maricopa-county-climate/index.html,2024-07-25 02:01:00,world,"
            Hundreds of people may have died from heat in Arizona’s Maricopa County amid another record-breaking summer in the state.
    

            Heat has killed 27 people in the county, which is home to Phoenix, and is suspected as the cause of 396 other deaths so far this year, according to figures released Tuesday.
    

            A total of 645 people died last year during the deadliest year for heat in the county since it started tracking the deaths in 2006. Nearly half of last year’s deaths came during a stretch of the most intense heat from July 10 to July 25. Fewer deaths were under investigation during that time span than the 396 currently under investigation.
    

            It typically takes two-to-three months to complete a heat death investigation and 75% of deaths under investigation last year were confirmed as heat related, Jeff Johnston, Maricopa County’s chief medical examiner, told CNN.
    

            Suspected heat deaths have soared in recent weeks alongside temperatures. About 100 of the suspected heat deaths this year happened from July 7 to 13, when high temperatures in Phoenix hit 118 degrees – exactly the kind of dangerous conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution with more frequent, intense and long-lasting heat waves.

            “We certainly know that when we have higher temperatures that we see more heat-related illness, and in those who are at highest risk, there are more heat related deaths,” Nick Staab, Maricopa County public health’s assistant medical director, told CNN. “That correlation between the temperature and the number of deaths has been shown over time.”
    

            Phoenix is currently experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. This June was hotter than last June, and this July has been nearly as warm as last July, which was the hottest month on record for any US city.
    

            Maricopa County said it is working to mitigate heat deaths by increasing the amount of cooling centers across the county, and lengthening operating hours for unsheltered individuals, the county’s most vulnerable group to heat.
    

            Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined.

It’s not just you. Here’s where this summer really has been the worst


            But heat deaths are still often undercounted, and there are many places that fail to report them accurately or regularly. A 2020 study found heat-related deaths were being underestimated in 297 of the country’s most populous counties. Researchers said mortality records tend to neglect other potentially heat-related causes of death, like heart attacks.
    

            Maricopa County changed the way it investigates heat deaths last year by enabling investigators to select more than one potential contributing factor to a death, including heat-related factors.Prior to this change, the number of potential heat-related cases under investigation were being undercounted, according to Johnston.
    

            Summer and heat in Arizona are far from over. Even though heat peaks in July in Phoenix, average high temperatures don’t drop below 100 degrees until mid-September.
    

            So, with suspected heat-related deaths already so high, the coming months will prove even more deadly.
    

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly characterized how Maricopa County investigated heat deaths. It has been updated.

CNN_51,"France’s forgotten athletes: As the world tunes in to the Olympics, many of Paris’ poorer suburbs see little benefit",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/sport/olympics-paris-suburbs-underfunded-clubs/index.html,2024-07-25 01:21:00,world,"
            When the world’s best track and field athletes arrive at the Stade de France for the Paris Olympics later this month, they will compete in state-of-the-art facilities: a newly renovated purple track, better lighting and bigger screens in the stands.
    

            Fans who want to watch an event like the 100m final on August 4 will have to shell out between $300 to more than $1,000 for a ticket.
    

            But if you walk a short distance away from the sparkling Stade de France, which is about six miles from downtown Paris, you’ll find a very different world.
    

            Seine-Saint-Denis, the northeastern department – roughly equivalent to a county in the US – where the stadium is located, is the poorest in mainland France, and for many of its 1.7 million residents, accessing facilities even close to the caliber of the Stade de France is a pipe dream.
    

            Olympic organizers like to pride themselves on the legacy of the Games and the “long-term benefits” they say they create for the host city and “its people.”
    

            Paris had pledged to revitalize Seine-Saint-Denis, home to many “banlieues,” poor and working-class suburbs with high immigrant populations, as part of its bid for the Games, Stéphane Troussel, the president of Seine-Saint-Denis Departmental Council, told CNN.
    

            Troussel said this pledge led to a joint bid – Paris-Seine-Saint-Denis – that was supposed to heal deep societal divisions and restore links to the city fractured after the 2015 terrorist attacks, which started with a series of explosions outside the Stade de France.
    

            French and Olympic officials made sweeping promises about the legacy of the Games – that the residents of Seine-Saint-Denis would be “at the heart of the Olympic project,” according to a press presentation from Paris 2024.
    

            Investment fueled by the Olympics has poured into Seine-Saint-Denis to fund improved public transit, more green spaces and better-quality housing, Troussel said.
    

            “We spend our time inaugurating” new developments, Troussel said. “It’s not the completion, but it’s a real tipping point. We have a decade of transformation before us that will change the place of Seine-Saint-Denis with respect to Greater Paris and Île-de-France.”
    

            Speaking to local residents at the inauguration of a new aquatics center in Saint-Denis, a banlieue in Seine-Saint-Denis, French President Emmanuel Macron made this ambition clear when he said, “After the Games, this will be yours.”
    

            But for some locals wanting to practice track and field, the legacy from the Games appears more mixed.
    

            AS Bondy’s track is almost 25 years old and showing signs of its age.
    

            Laurence Baillargeau, who works at the club in Bondy – a town east of the Stade de France, famed for being where Real Madrid soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé was raised – told CNN it is riddled with holes. With a lack of resources to renovate it, there’s a risk of injury for athletes, and although no one has been hurt so far, “we’re crossing our fingers” it doesn’t happen, she said.
    

            Baillargeau said that AS Bondy got no funding from the Games. Photos of the track seen by CNN show holes littered with cigarette butts, torn patches and grass pushing through the surface.
    

            “With the track damaged, we can no longer organize competitions,” Baillargeau said.
    

            Seine-Saint-Denis has three times fewer training facilities per 10,000 residents than the national average – 16 as compared to 45, Troussel said.
    

            The department also ranks 103rd out of the 105 French regions and territories in terms of the number of facilities, according to a report on regional investment linked to the Olympics.
    

            Funding for track and field facilities is entirely dependent on local governments.
    

            “Inequalities and financial disparities have a cumulative effect. The communes of Seine-Saint-Denis sometimes have a poor population with more limited means that sometimes prevents them from building facilities or renovating facilities sufficiently,” Troussel said.
    

            There’s also a divide between big and small clubs. Larger ones get substantial subsidies, while smaller clubs are left with scraps. For example, CA Montreuil, the 20-time French track and field champion, received $492,000 (€450,000), while Saint-Denis Émotion received $32,800 (€30,000), according to Troussel’s office.
    

            “I think it’s a longtime problem because we must not forget that it’s not a professional sport, it’s an amateur one, so it’s more complicated to structure, to get financing, to get subsidies,” said Sandra Ribeiro, a former pole-vaulter for Portugal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics who grew up in Aulnay-sous-Bois, another banlieue in Seine-Saint-Denis.
    

            With her sister, Ribeiro started Perfe-o, a business which supports high-level athletes with career advice, training and financing.
    

            “It’s easier to support champions when there are subsidies. It’s more difficult for a smaller club to support elite athletes if they don’t have the means to do so,” Ribeiro told CNN Sport.
    

            Ribeiro says this means athletes frequently move to larger clubs because it’s their only way to train at a high level.
    

            The Paris 2024 Organizing Committee did not respond to multiple interview requests from CNN for this story.
    

            In contrast to the aging track in Bondy, CSME Athlétisme, in the commune of Épinay-sur-Seine, now has “everything it needs,” according to club president Cedric Jacqué. The club was renovated with funds from the Games.
    

            But before the renovations, conditions were dire.
    

            “We had a track outside, but it was in very bad shape,” Anna Viallard, a coach at the club, said. “There were blisters that were forming on the track. Water was seeping under the track, and it was unusable.
    

            “The children were slipping in the jumping pit, the sandpits were in a catastrophic state, the same with the pole vault.”
    

            Viallard tells CNN that the Games are put on “to dazzle at the national and international levels.”
    

            But residents of the communities around the Stade de France feel left behind.
    

            To tackle the problem, Seine-Saint-Denis created the “Generation Games” financial package to subsidize ambitious talent in the area.
    

            One of the athletes who benefited is Mallory Leconte, a runner who helped Team France qualify for the 4x100m Olympic relay event but was not selected in the final group competing in the Games.
    

            “They were helping us financially, and so did our clubs,” Leconte said. “In exchange, we would become ambassadors for the region, to talk and tour in schools, for example. I received $3,280 (€3,000) from the Seine-Saint-Denis local council and $10,900 (€10,000) from the Île-de-France region (the greater area of Paris).”
    

            However, the Games also created problems for her own preparation. Because her club, Saint-Denis Émotion, is being used as a warm-up area for athletes competing at the nearby Stade de France, it closed two years ago for renovations. She and other athletes were forced to travel to other clubs to train.
    

            “We no longer had a stadium. Therefore, we had to train on concrete. We have to go to a private gym now. We used to have our own equipment there. Also, we had to change facilities multiple times,” Leconte said.
    

            A shortage of coaches at smaller clubs is another challenge for athletes training to compete at a higher level, especially for track and field, Viallard said.
    

            Finding qualified instructors in Île-de-France is not easy.

            At CSME Athlétisme, even with its comparatively greater resources, Viallard says she is “practically alone” in coaching the club’s 180 members.
    

            “I am tired,” she said. “I can’t coach in good conditions because I can’t be in two places at once and I can’t watch everyone.”
    

            Viallard says some of her athletes are beginning to qualify at the regional level, but she knows she “doesn’t have the means to support them because I can’t focus on one person when I have a group of 30 who are also counting on me to take care of them. It’s very frustrating because recently I have lost one of the best French athletes.”
    

            The investment in sporting facilities connected to the Games has also focused particularly on swimming facilities, in a region where over 60% of children entering secondary school do not know how to swim.
    

            But outside of the Games, swimming and track and field are not where the money goes.
    

            For the residents of Bondy, soccer is everything.
    

            Mbappé – one of the sport’s biggest stars and captain of France’s national soccer team – is from Bondy, and the children who live there dream to play like him.
    

            Everyone CNN interviewed agreed that soccer is the privileged sport in Seine-Saint-Denis, both in terms of interest and investment. Troussel’s office told CNN that soccer is the most subsidized sport, with the area’s more than 100 clubs receiving a total of around €700,000 per year.
    

            Often, the two go hand-in-hand, especially when it comes to infrastructure for sports.

            “Everything is done to welcome the most soccer players possible, to the detriment sometimes of a number of sports,” Viallard said.
    

            “It’s a sport where there’s money,” added Viallard.
    

            Soccer can be played on artificial turf, which is easier to train on and cheaper to maintain than grass. But for track and field, the surface can change how athletes are able to practice.
    

            This is the case at CSME Athlétisme, and the club has had to adapt. Viallard says the club uses rubber discuses and javelins with rubber tips to reduce the wear and tear on the turf and keep athletes safe from injury. Members of AS Bondy can’t do these sports at all, Baillargeau said.
    

            While shot put is supposed to be done in a concrete circle, Viallard says her athletes must travel further away to a gravel field designed for the French sport pétanque, where the surface could increase the risk of slipping.
    

            Athletes are highly impacted by these conditions, before and after renovations.
    

            But it doesn’t affect their motivation, says 15-year-old Keilyne Ait Mouffok.
    

            “When they were puddles, we would avoid them. So, it didn’t bother us so much. However, when we would train for 4x200m, it was more problematic,” Mouffok, who trains at CSME Athlétisme, said.
    

            She said she doesn’t mind sharing the facilities with other clubs either.
    

            As for the legacy the Games will leave behind, former pole vaulter Ribeiro thinks the new facilities will be well-maintained long after the Olympics are over because residents have wanted the upgrades for so long.
    

            Troussel said a former politician in London gave him important advice when it came to the Games: “The legacy, the impact on your region and its residents, it is for you to take care of. It is on you to leave nothing out, to let nothing go. It is on you to advocate for that.”

CNN_52,Olympic Opening Ceremony dancers call off strike action,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/sport/olympic-opening-ceremony-striking-dancers-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-25 01:06:00,world,"
            Hundreds of dancers threatening to disrupt the Olympic Games’ Opening Ceremony over pay have called off strike action after reaching an agreement with Paris 2024, according to a statement from the union representing the dancers.
    

            FSA-CGT union said on Wednesday that it received a “final offer” from Paris 2024 and their employers, proposing to increase payment for broadcasting performance rights for everyone.

            On Monday, some 220 dancers stopped a rehearsal along the banks of Paris’ River Seine – along which the Opening Ceremony is due to take place – to protest inequalities in pay and housing conditions between the dancers.
    

            A representative for the union previously told CNN that the ceremony was “in danger” after a protest and possible strike action by more than 200 dancers due to take part in Friday’s ceremony, a union representative for the dancers told CNN Tuesday.
    

            “The ceremony is in danger in a sense, yes. But it will depend on solidarity because the strike is an individual decision,” Lucie Sorin, a delegate for the FSA-CGT union, previously told CNN.
    

            She said that the dancers were negotiating with Paris 2024 and their employers to obtain higher salaries and a sum of money for the “most precarious” performers.
    

            But the union said Wednesday added that “in agreement with the artists concerned,” it has decided “to accept this proposal and to lift the strike notice for the ceremony on Friday July 26.”
    

            The union said that the outcome wasn’t a total victory but that it met certain demands, in particular those of the dancers most at risk.
    

            This year’s Opening Ceremony will be the first ever held on a river.
    

            Some 104,000 people in stands lining the River Seine will watch the event, with 220,000 more on raised roadways along a six-kilometer (nearly four miles) stretch of the river, according to French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin.
    

            For years, French officials had boasted that some 600,000 people would attend the Opening Ceremony, but that number has been slashed due to safety concerns.

CNN_53,Equestrian dressage star Charlotte Dujardin announces sudden withdrawal from Paris Olympics,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/sport/charlotte-dujardin-withdraws-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html,2024-07-24 22:41:00,world,"
            Three-time Olympic gold medal winner Charlotte Dujardin has shockingly announced she has pulled out of Paris 2024 just days before the opening ceremony.
    

            In a social media post, the famed British dressage star said she had withdrawn from all competition due to “making an error of judgement during a coaching session.”
    

            Dujardin admitted a video she said was from four years ago showed her acting “completely out of character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils.”
    

            A video has since surfaced showing Dujardin repeatedly whipping a horse during training.

            The startling disclosure comes just days before Dujardin was attempting to become the most decorated British female Olympian of all time.
    

            She has won a total of six Olympic medals – two silvers, a bronze, and three golds.
    

            Another medal in Paris, in either individual or team dressage, would have broken the tie with retired track cyclist Laura Kenny.
    

            The decorated rider was to ride Imhotep at her fourth Olympic Games for Team GB.
    

            Later on Tuesday, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) announced it had provisionally suspended Dujardin, saying it was “deeply disappointed.”
    

            In a statement, the FEI said: “On 22 July 2024, the FEI received a video depicting Ms. Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare.
    

            “This video was submitted to the FEI by a lawyer representing an undisclosed complainant. According to the information received, the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms. Dujardin at a private stable.”
    

            The governing body said Dujardin admitted her conduct was inappropriate as an investigation into her actions continues.
    

            “The FEI condemns any conduct contrary to the welfare of horses and has robust rules in place to address such behaviour,” the statement added

            The Netherlands’ Olympic chief has said he is “surprised” at reactions towards Steven van de Velde, the Dutch beach volleyball player who served time in prison for raping a child 10 years ago and who will represent the Netherlands at this year’s Olympics.
    

            Van de Velde, who is now 29, was sentenced to four years in prison in 2014 for raping the girl who was aged 12, according to British media. He was released in 2017.
    

            He has now been selected to represent the Netherlands in beach volleyball for this summer’s Olympic Games in Paris.
    

            “He has been active in international sports, the beach volleyball world, for a long time,” Pieter van den Hoogenband, Netherlands chef de mission told Dutch broadcaster NOS in an interview that aired on Sunday.
    

            “He has played in World Cups, European Championships and World Championships, but then you see that things are different around the Games. … That things are exaggerated around the Games.”
    

            Van den Hoogenband’s comments come after public reactions to van de Velde’s selection to represent the Netherlands, including from other Olympic participants.
    

            While refusing to discuss specific cases in terms of other countries’ choices for their national team, Australian chef de mission Anna Meares said Monday: “If an athlete or staff member had that conviction, they would not be allowed to be a member of our team.”
    

            “We have stringent policies on safeguarding within our team.”
    

            “We know Steven’s history,” Michel Everaert, general director at Nevobo – the Dutch Volleyball Federation – said in a statement at the time of van de Velde’s selection in late June.
    

            Everaert said that the federation spoke extensively with the Dutch National Olympic Committee (NOC), the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and van de Velde before his return to the sport.
    

            “He was convicted at the time according to English law and he has served his sentence. From then on, we have been in constant contact with Steven, who has now been fully reintegrated into the Dutch volleyball community,” Everaert added in the statement.

            Van de Velde served some of his sentence in England before being transferred to the Netherlands, where he was released and returned to playing in 2017, according to Nevobo.
    

            In 2018, van de Velde told national broadcaster NOS: “I did what I did. I can’t take it back, so I will have to carry the consequences. You can judge, of course. It is the biggest mistake of my life.”
    

            “He is proving to be an exemplary professional and human being and there has been no reason to doubt him since his return,” added Everaert.
    

            The federation noted that van de Velde was aware this “black period in his life” would resurface “but is obviously not happy about it.”
    

            In the statement released by Nevobo, van de Velde said he is grateful for the chance.
    

            “I understand that in the run-up to the biggest sporting event in the world, this can attract the attention of international media,” added van de Velde.
    

            “Because of the second chance I got from my parents, my friends, acquaintances and colleagues, who accepted me again after the biggest misstep of my then young life,” he said.
    

            “I am also grateful to the Dutch volleyball federation, because they offered me, with clear conditions and agreements, a future in this beautiful sport again. But I also think back to the teenager I was, who was insecure, not ready for a life as a top class athlete and unhappy inside, because I didn’t know who I was and what I wanted.”
    

            Nevobo and the Dutch NOC said in a statement that they supported van de Velde, adding that they, along with the FIVB, had consulted experts who considered his chance of recidivism “nil.”
    

            “After his conviction and sentence, Steven van de Velde returned to the highest level of sport step-by-step under the expert guidance of probation and coaching, among others. He has been participating in international tournaments again since 2017,” Nevobo said in a statement.
    

            The Dutch NOC added that van de Velde returned to professional sport on the basis of its guidelines, “which sets out, among other things, the conditions under which athletes in top-level sports can return after a conviction.”
    

            “Van de Velde now meets all the qualification requirements for the Olympic Games and is therefore part of the team,” the committee added.
    

            The International Olympic Committee told CNN that the “nomination of individual team members, following qualification on the field of play, is the sole responsibility of each respective National Olympic Committee. Therefore, we would refer to the Dutch NOC for any further information.”
    

            Ju’Riese Colon, CEO for the US Center for SafeSport said in a statement sent to CNN that the organization was “deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate in the 2024 Olympic Games.”
    

            “With teams from around the world about to convene in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety. Participation in sport is a privilege not a right,” she added.

CNN_55,Trump says Taiwan stole America’s chip industry. But that’s not true,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/tech/trump-taiwan-tsmc-chips-industry-hnk-intl/index.html,2024-07-24 09:34:00,world,"
            Former US President Donald Trump raised eyebrows last week when he accused Taiwan of snatching America’s crown in the $500 billion business of making computer chips.
    

            In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the Republican presidential nominee repeated his assertion, first made last year, that the island democracy and US ally had taken “almost 100%” of the industry from the United States. “We should have never let that happen,” he added.
    

            Except, it didn’t. Industry experts tell CNN that, far from stealing, Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment.
    

            School children on the island know that the father of its world-beating chips sector is Morris Chang, a 93-year-old Chinese-born American, who started Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 1987 at age 55 after a long career working with semiconductors in the US.
    

            At the time, the industry leaders were Intel (INTC), Motorola (MSI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), where Chang had previously worked. But in starting TSMC (TSM), Chang had an entirely different business model in mind, which was completely revolutionary at the time.
    

            “We had no strength in research and development, or very little anyway. We had no strength in circuit design,” he recalled in a 2007 oral history project recorded for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.
    

            “We had little strength in sales and marketing, and we had almost no strength in intellectual property. The only possible strength that Taiwan had, and even that was a potential one, not an obvious one, was semiconductor manufacturing,” he said.
    

            Thus, the idea of a “pure-play foundry,” or manufacturing semiconductors according to designs provided by clients, was born. That model was dismissed at the time, when having both design and manufacturing capabilities in-house was the norm.
    

            It was this new approach that reshaped the landscape of the global electronics sector and laid the foundation for Taiwan to be the industry leader. It now produces more than 90% of the world’s advanced chips, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.
    

            “Because of it, TSMC could focus on manufacturing and be very good at it, and more importantly, it could manufacture for multiple different customers, which would let the company scale up,” said Christopher Miller, author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.”
    

            Scale is critical to TSMC’s success, Miller said, as it tends to generate more revenue — which can be funneled into improving chip production technologies — and drive down manufacturing cost, making the entire operation more efficient.
    

            Today, the tech behemoth possesses the most advanced chip production technologies in the world and plans to keep investing in the area. Last July, TSMC opened its global research and development center in Hsinchu, where it is headquartered.
    

            Experts said the contract manufacturing model, something Taiwan had used in other sectors such as textiles and consumer electronics before chips, worked particularly well.
    

            “The combination of top-tier engineers, relatively lower labor cost and long working hours have led to better productivity,” Konrad Young, a former research and development director at TSMC, told CNN, adding that Taiwan’s comprehensive tech ecosystem is another crucial component of the island’s chip prowess.
    

            “These are factors that are nearly impossible to duplicate,” Young said.
    

            But that doesn’t mean competitors aren’t trying. Intel and Samsung Electronics are both trying to emulate TSMC’s success in making chips for other companies.
    

            When asked by CNN what the Taiwanese government would do if Washington presses Taiwan to move some of its chip-related research and development functions to the US, Premier Cho Jung-tai said the island has no plan to change its playbook.
    

            “Taiwan has very good tech talent and an environment for research, development and investment. We are confident that keeping research and development of cutting-edge technologies in Taiwan is the best choice for these enterprises,” Cho told CNN.
    

            In the Bloomberg Businessweek interview, Trump additionally indicated that Taiwan should pay Washington for its defense.
    

            “Taiwan should pay us for defense. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn’t give us anything,” he said, while suggesting that the US would have difficulty defending the island because of its distance, stating “Taiwan is 9,500 miles away (from the US). It’s 68 miles away from China.”
    

            Within Taiwan, Trump’s remarks are being compared to demands for a “protection fee.” It has caused unease about how the Republican presidential nominee,  if elected president, may affect ties with the US, the island’s most important security guarantor, at a time when the risk of China invading Taiwan looms ever larger.
    

            Persistent tension in the Taiwan Strait has put pressure on TSMC to expand outside of Taiwan to diversify its production base. Within the US, the chip shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the increasingly strategic importance of the industry due to the rivalry between the US and China, have prompted calls to revive chip manufacturing domestically.
    

            In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, aiming to boost domestic production of chips, which stands at about 10% of the global supply, and reduce reliance on Taiwan and South Korea for the most advanced ones.
    

            While it is unclear what a potential Trump presidency could mean for Taiwan, Young says chip firms should strive to find a better way to work together for a mutually beneficial relationship. This is particularly important for TSMC, which is building three factories in Arizona but has faced headwinds in getting its facilities on track because of reasons ranging from different labor laws to work culture.
    

            “TSMC would have to figure out a way to put in place a manufacturing system that fits the culture of wherever it is building its fabs,” Young said, referring to fabrication plants where chips are made. “Only by doing so can TSMC truly become a global company.”

CNN_56,"Harris is less than 2 weeks away from naming running mate, with vetting and polling underway",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/vice-president-pick-kamala-harris/index.html,2024-07-25 05:42:00,politics,"
            Vice President Kamala Harris is less than two weeks away from naming her own running mate.
    

            That’s the timeline the presumptive Democratic nominee has given to a team of lawyers and advisers who are conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history, people familiar with the process tell CNN, with a goal of announcing a nominee before August 7.
    

            Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.
    

            Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say.
    

            “She will pick someone she’s comfortable with – someone who is ready to be president,” a Democrat close to the process tells CNN, adding that Harris is not tipping her hand to any early favorites among the contenders.

A shortlist of Democrats who could be a vice presidential pick for Harris


            Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a team that is poring through financial documents, family histories, public statements, published documents, voting records, campaign experience and social media postings. Tony West, a former associate attorney general under Holder who is Harris’ brother-in-law, is also playing a central role in the search.
    

            CNN has also learned that Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and any of the prospective candidates would fare in their home states – and key battlegrounds – in hypothetical matchups against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.
    

            Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman who often serves as a sounding board for Harris, is also playing an unofficial role in the search, people familiar with the process say, along with other top advisers to Harris.
    

            The truncated process means that nearly four years after Harris answered the call from Joe Biden to be his running mate – on August 11, 2020 – she intends to make a call of her own, asking one of the men on the list to join her Democratic ticket.
    

            A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS showed no clear leader in a matchup between Harris and Trump. The former president holds 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the survey’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling this year had found about a Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee’s rules panel on Wednesday adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin August 1. The party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7.

CNN_58,Ford keeps having to repair customers’ new cars and trucks. Its profit is plunging and its stock tumbled,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/ford-profit-share-plunge/index.html,2024-07-25 05:31:00,us,"
            Shares of Ford fell more than 11% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the automaker reported much weaker than expected earnings. The company said it was compelled to set aside more money to cover the cost of repairing customers’ vehicles.
    

            The company (F) did not break out how much extra money it set aside to cover warranty expenses, but said “most” of the $1.2 billion drop in operating income in the quarter came from that increased expense. Still, Ford said it is making gains in product quality, despite the increased costs.
    

            “We still have lots of work ahead of us to raise quality and reduce costs and complexity, but the team is committed and we’re heading in the right direction,” said Ford CFO John Lawler in the company’s earnings report.
    

            The company’s adjusted net income fell $1 billion to $1.9 billion, or 47 cents a share. That badly missed analysts’ forecasts of earnings per share of 68 cents a share.
    

            The company Model e unit, which includes its electric vehicle sales to consumers rather than businesses, had an operating loss of $1.1 billion, but that was essentially unchanged from a year ago. It was the nearly 50% drop in operating profit in Ford Blue, which includes traditional gasoline-powered cars and truck sales to consumers, that hurt its bottom line. Ford Pro, which includes fleet sales to businesses and governments, reported a modest gain in operating profits.
    

            Revenue rose 6% to $4.7 as the number of vehicles sold edged up 2% to 1.1 million worldwide.

CNN_60,Netanyahu labels critics of war in Gaza ‘Iran’s useful idiots’ in speech to Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/benjamin-netanyahu-address-washington/index.html,2024-07-25 06:27:00,politics,"
            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out against protests of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, broadly disparaging anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” in an address to Congress on Wednesday.
    

            Netanyahu’s address to Congress comes at a crucial crossroads for the war. US officials have voiced optimism about the prospects of a deal that could free Hamas-held hostages and bring the conflict to an end. It also comes as many on the left have become increasingly dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu has waged the war, which has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe.
    

            The Israeli prime minister’s nearly hour-long address to Congress struck a bellicose tone as he vowed to “fight until we achieve victory.” Netanyahu falsely downplayed and deflected on the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian strife in Gaza. Although he made some reference to efforts to bring the hostages home, significantly more of the speech focused on the ongoing war and took aim at his foes – Iran, the International Criminal Court and protesters.
    

            The US has seen protests across the country on college campuses and elsewhere in opposition to the war against Hamas. On the day of Netanyahu’s speech, there were protests both outside and inside the US Capitol complex. Additionally, the Secret Service is investigating reports that protesters gained access to the hotel building where Netanyahu is staying in Washington, DC, releasing bugs in the hotel and pulling fire alarms, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    

            Netanyahu painted protesters with a broad brush, claiming that “many choose to stand with evil” and that “they stand with Hamas” and “rapists and murderers.”
    

            While Netanyahu heavily criticized protests against the war, both President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have affirmed the right to protest and indicated they believe pro-Palestinian protesters have legitimate grievances – while still criticizing rhetoric that has devolved into antisemitism.
    

            Speaking at a news conference in April, Blinken said he understands the “strong, passionate feelings” people have about the bloodshed in Gaza.
    

            “It’s a hallmark of our democracy that our citizens make known their views, their concerns, their anger at any given time. And I think that reflects the strength of the country, the strength of democracy,” he said about pro-Palestinian protests.
    

            Biden, who has repeatedly faced pro-Palestinian protests at his public events this year, often appears conciliatory toward those interrupting him.
    

            “I understand the passion,” he said after he was repeatedly interrupted during a campaign event at a South Carolina church earlier this year.
    

            In his address to Congress, Netanyahu referenced a recent statement from US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines that Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the conflict in Gaza.
    

            In her statement, Haines said, however, that she wanted “to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza,” adding that “this intelligence does not indicate otherwise.”
    

            “I have a message for these protesters: When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu said.
    

            Some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, either as a protest of the war or due to previously scheduled events. The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly become a dividing line among Democrats, exposing rifts within the party.
    

            At one point, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a sign during the speech that on one side said: “war criminal,” and the other side said: “guilty of genocide.”
    

            Netanyahu slammed those accusing Israel of genocide, suggesting that such accusations were antisemitic.
    

            “The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state, and to demonize Jews everywhere,” he said.
    

            Netanyahu specifically slammed the International Criminal Court’s allegations that Israel is starving Palestinians in Gaza, calling it “utter, complete nonsense” and “a complete fabrication.”
    

            According to the UN, 96% of the population of Gaza currently faces “crisis or worse levels of food insecurity.” Humanitarian aid workers say the war and restrictions imposed by the Israeli government on aid access to Gaza have brought the strip to the brink.
    

            Netanyahu thanked Biden during his speech for his support for Israel, even as Biden’s relationship with Netanyahu has grown steadily colder as the war in Gaza has lagged on and as the death toll in the beleaguered enclave continues to rise. Both leaders have known each other for decades, but have traded not-so-subtle barbs at each other as their disagreements with the war’s future have spilled into the public.
    

            “I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,” he said, thanking Biden “for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.”
    

            The speech to Congress comes as the bulk of the nation’s attention has been focused in recent weeks on discussions surrounding Biden’s age and mental fitness – which culminated in Biden announcing over the weekend that he would step down from the Democratic ticket – along with the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Convention.
    

            “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,” Netanyahu said.
    

            During his speech to Congress, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of close ties between the US and Israel.
    

            “For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,” Netanyahu said to loud cheers from lawmakers in attendance. “Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.”
    

            There were moments of bipartisanship during the speech. Twice when Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden, both sides gave him a standing ovation. When Netanyahu condemned political violence, that prompted another standing ovation from both sides.

Netanyahu’s long history of confounding US presidents


            Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.
    

            Biden has said that Israel has reached its stated goal, described the country’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” and plainly stated his desire for the war to end. The president has said it is “uncertain” whether Israel had committed war crimes. He has also hinted that he believes Netanyahu is dragging out the war only for the sake of his own political survival.
    

            Netanyahu, meanwhile, has accused the United States of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” claims that American officials flatly rejected.
    

            Netanyahu forcefully defended Israel’s right to self-defense in his remarks, saying, “the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always defend itself.”
    

            “As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.
    

            After arriving in Washington earlier this week, Netanyahu met with some American relatives of hostages held by Hamas. Not all participants were pleased with how that meeting ended.
    

            Trump and Netanyahu will also meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.
    

            A number of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, with some declining to attend in protest over the war or because of previously scheduled events.
    

            Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, did not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, but she is planning to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official told CNN. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech.
    

            Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would skip the address in protest of the “total war” Netanyahu’s government has waged in Gaza.
    

            “No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,” Sanders said in a statement. “On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned.”

CNN_61,Chipotle’s CEO weighs in on the burrito bowl portion size debate,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/chipotles-ceo-burrito-bowl-portion-size-debate/index.html,2024-07-25 06:52:00,us,"
            Customers on social media have been furious with Chipotle for allegedly skimping on its burrito bowl portions this year. Now, the fast-casual chain’s CEO said the company is making changes.
    

            “First, there was never a directive to provide less to our customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said during an earnings call Wednesday. “With that said, getting the feedback caused us to relook at our execution across our entire system.”
    

            Niccol said the company will make “generous portions” more consistent across its more than 3,500 restaurants. He said about 10% of stores are outliers in portion sizes, and those locations will have to be retrained to the “right standards.”
    

            With rising prices for food, many chains have been accused of shrinkflation, or selling tinier portion sizes for the same amount of money.
    

            In June, a Wells Fargo analyst ordered and weighed 75 Chipotle burrito bowls with white rice, black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, cheese and lettuce across eight Chipotle locations in New York City. His team found a wide variety of the portion sizes.
    

            The bowls weighed roughly the same for in-store orders and online orders, but some locations served bowls that weighed 33% more than other locations. Some burrito bowls went to extremes, with one topping out at 27 ounces in one location, and a meager 14 ounces in another. The median weight was around 21.5 ounces.
    

            Some Chiptole customers began filming employees as they built their orders to ensure satisfactory portions — but some employees pushed back, claiming the TikTok trend was “stressful and dehumanizing.”
    

            Niccols said the company is reemphasizing its mission of a lot of food for a fair price.
    

            “We are reemphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly,” Niccol said.
    

            The shrinkflation claims have not hurt Chipotle’s business, the company said Wednesday, though its fast casual peers from McDonald’s to MOD Pizza have struggled as more consumers choose to dine at home. The company beat analyst expectations, and its net sales rose about 18% in the second quarter of 2024.
    

            The company said more customers were drawn to the reintroduced chicken al pastor on the menu. It also said last year’s price increases helped offset pricier avocados and increased oil used to fry tortilla chips.

CNN_62,CrowdStrike to vendors: Sorry for the global tech outage. Here’s a $10 Uber Eats voucher,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/crowdstrike-outage-uber-eats/index.html,2024-07-25 06:51:00,us,"
A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.


            A single CrowdStrike bug sent the entire tech world into chaos last week — a snafu some companies (see: Delta) are still recovering from. Third-party agents selling and supporting CrowdStrike software and the complicated repairs for customers have been a miserably busy bunch over the past week.
    

            CrowdStrike’s token of appreciation for those vendors: a $10 Uber Eats voucher. We’re not kidding.
    

            When reports of the voucher “gifts” first surfaced on Wednesday afternoon there were three main buckets of reactions:
    

            Partners are working under immense pressure as the point of contact for their customers who, in some cases, still can’t operate their businesses as smoothly compared to before the outage.
    

            Now partners could risk losing their customers as a result of this mess, even though it was out of their control. But a $10 Uber Eats voucher should make it all better, right?
    

            A lot of users across social media platforms compared this to an office pizza party. Those tend to happen when bosses want to show they appreciate their employees’ hard work. There’s just a slight problem: Cheese and pepperoni don’t pay the bills.
    

            The ironic part is, at least where I’m located, I can’t even get a pizza for $10 on Uber Eats after taxes and fees.
    

            A can of Coke, a package of two small Twinkies and a Hershey’s chocolate bar were all among the very, very limited number of items I was able to identify that, purchased individually, would come out to just under $10 including taxes and fees. But that doesn’t even include a tip.
    

            The CrowdStrike outage is Christmas in July for cybercriminals, who have been setting up phony websites meant to appeal to people seeking information on, or solutions to, the worldwide IT meltdown but in reality are designed to harvest visitors’ information or to breach their devices, my colleagues Brian Fung and Sean Lyngaas reported.
    

            So everyone, understandably, is on guard. And it didn’t help that the voucher code in the email sent to many partners stopped working.
    

            A CrowdStrike spokesperson confirmed the emails with the $10 vouchers were legitimate, adding that “Uber flagged it as fraud because of high usage rates.” Likely meaning too many people were trying to piggyback off a lousy $10 voucher code sent to one person. Uber didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            As all of this was unraveling, some details got lost in translation about who was receiving the $10 vouchers. Many people incorrectly believed CrowdStrike was compensating customers for all their troubles.
    

            That would be a pittance compared to what customers lost. The outage may have cost Fortune 500 companies as much as $5.4 billion in revenues and gross profit, according to an analysis from Parametrix, a cloud monitoring and insurance firm.
    

            But it’s not clear if CrowdStrike will pay them back. The company hasn’t commented on any financial remediation efforts with customers. But experts told my colleague Chris Isidore that there will be demands for remuneration and very possibly lawsuits.
    

            CrowdStrike has, however, apologized to them. But the software giant has yet to dole out a nickel to them for their troubles — not even a $10 Uber Eats voucher.

CNN_64,Trump slams Harris as an ‘ultra-liberal’ as he returns to the campaign trail under a reshaped political landscape,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/donald-trump-rally-north-carolina/index.html,2024-07-25 07:43:00,politics,"
Donald Trump stepped onto the campaign trail Wednesday to an entirely new race and a political landscape once again irrevocably altered by an unprecedented election year.
    

            The former president’s rally here was﻿ his first since President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid Sunday, setting off a chain of events that appears destined to end with Trump facing Vice President Kamala Harris in November.
    

            Trump lost no time Wednesday turning his focus to his likely new opponent, dubbing her “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and painting her as a “radical liberal” whom voters will reject in November.
    

            “Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,” the former president told his supporters.
    

            Biden’s decision to end his campaign and Harris’ subsequent elevation has sent a surge of adrenaline through the Democratic Party and unleashed a wave of new donations to compete with Trump’s own strengthened financial position. Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign are working to reimagine a playbook and operation launched to take on an unpopular 81-year-old incumbent.
    

            Trump told the audience in Charlotte that he “was supposed to be nice,” alluding to his message of unity after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania the weekend before the Republican National Convention.
    

            “They say something happened to me when I got shot: I became nice,” Trump said. “If you don’t mind, I’m not going to be nice,” he added to roars from the crowd.
    

            “This November, the American people are going to tell her, ‘No thanks, Kamala. You’ve done a terrible job. You’ve been terrible at everything,’” said the former president, who slammed Harris over the border and inflation.
    

            In a campaign already marked by extraordinary events – a significant civil judgment against Trump, a felony conviction, an indictment dismissed and another delayed by a scandal in the Georgia prosecutor’s office, Biden’s confidence-shattering debate performance and the assassination attempt – the latest twist has plunged the presidential race deeper into uncharted territory.
    

            Trump spent Tuesday reacting to his changed political fortunes. In a barrage of social media posts, the former president ripped into his likely new opponent, lamented that Republicans were forced “to waste a great deal of time and money” prior to the Democratic shake-up, suggested that the “Biden/Harris administration” was to blame for the assassination attempt on his life, criticized Democratic tributes to Biden (“He was pushed out of power like a dog,” the former president wrote) and ripped Fox News for giving airtime to the Democratic governor of Minnesota, a state Trump is targeting.

Harris makes first trip to battleground Wisconsin since launching presidential campaign


            “They make me fight battles that I shouldn’t have to fight!” Trump said of the network.
    

            Later, Trump held a call with reporters – the first of its kind this cycle – during which he tested new attack lines against Harris.
    

            “As a result of her dangerously extreme immigration policies, the largest invasion in history is now taking place at our southern border, and it’s getting worse, not better,” said Trump, who has spent the past 19 months attacking Biden over the border while rarely mentioning Harris.
    

            The Democratic National Committee responded to the stepped-up attacks on Harris over immigration by highlighting Trump’s successful effort to kill a bipartisan immigration deal earlier this year.
    

            Trump’s team insists it was prepared for a change at the top of the Democratic ticket long before Biden officially dropped out, pointing to an internal memo from May laying out scenarios that would result in an open convention and another Democrat as the nominee.
    

            Senior Trump advisers continue to suggest that a campaign against Harris would largely center on the same issues once used to criticize Biden: crime, immigration and inflation. As Biden’s second in command, Harris played a key role in shaping the administration’s approaches to those topics, they will argue.
    

            However, some individuals close to Trump acknowledge the uncertainty brought on by Harris’ candidacy, specifically what new Democratic enthusiasm could mean for turnout in November. A new CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in a Trump-Harris matchup: The former president held 49% support among registered voters nationwide to Harris’ 46%, a finding within the poll’s margin of sampling error. Still, that was a closer contest than earlier CNN polling had found about a Biden-Trump matchup.
    

            Trump’s campaign had been bracing for the fresh excitement over Harris to generate a bump for her in the polls, as it laid out in an expectation-setting memo Tuesday from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio. He predicted that Harris would start “gaining on or even leading President Trump” in the polls, though he also insisted that the “honeymoon” period would end.
    

            Trump’s team faces a race against the clock to define Harris before she can fully turn the Biden election machine into her own campaign. Though polls suggest Harris is a recognizable figure, the Trump campaign remains convinced that the public doesn’t know much about her – referring to the gap as “name education.” The campaign intends to spend the coming weeks trying to fill that knowledge void with as much negative information about Harris as it can.
    

            Fabrizio in his memo previewed what the Trump campaign is expected to attack: Harris’ record in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general; her tie-breaking vote as vice president on the Inflation Reduction Act, a law Biden championed to boost investments to reverse climate change; and her response to the rise in migrant border crossings.

            A source close to Trump also indicated that the campaign and its allies are planning to specifically highlight certain choices she made as San Francisco district attorney in an attempt to portray her as lenient on violent criminals.
    

            “So, while the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’ done,” Fabrizio wrote.
    

            The leading pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., launched a new 30-second spot Sunday, first shared on social media, showcasing another plan of attack. The ad says Harris “covered up Joe Biden’s obvious mental decline” and features a clip of her praising Biden’s performance as president. “Our president is in good shape, in good health, tireless, vibrant, and I have no doubt about the strength of the work that we have done,” Harris says in the clip.
    

            The group, which has already spent $77 million on ads boosting Trump so far, announced plans to air the ad in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.
    

            Trump’s appearance in Charlotte provided his first opportunity to contrast himself with Harris before voters in a battleground state. Four years ago, North Carolina produced Trump’s narrowest margin of statewide victory, and it is expected to be a top battleground again in 2024.
    

            In a memo released Wednesday, the Harris campaign outlined its view of the candidate’s electoral path to victory, painting a much more optimistic picture beyond the so-called Blue Wall states to include the battleground states of the Sun Belt such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. It’s a notable change from where things stood just weeks ago when a Biden campaign memo acknowledged that those Sun Belt states were no longer as competitive.

CNN_65,Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife defends Harris against sexist criticisms of her as childless,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/kerstin-emhoff-defends-kamala-harris-sexism/index.html,2024-07-25 07:31:00,politics,"
            The ex-wife of second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Wednesday defended Vice President Kamala Harris against sexist criticisms about her lack of biological children, calling them “baseless” and expressing her gratitude for the presumptive Democratic nominee.
    

            “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement first provided to CNN. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”
    

            Emhoff’s statement follows resurfaced video of Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance criticizing several public figures, including Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.”
    

            “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance told Tucker Carlson in a July 2021 interview.
    

            Kerstin Emhoff, a film producer, shares two children with Doug Emhoff. The vice president has said her stepchildren refer to her as “Momala.”
    

            Spokespeople for Vance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his 2021 statement. Vance is a father of three.
    

            Harris has already faced rounds of attacks on her race and gender. Right wing media have been maligning Harris at an increased clip since President Joe Biden announced he was dropping from the race Sunday and endorsed Harris, slamming the vice president as a “DEI” candidate while criticizing everything from her romantic history to the way she laughs.
    

            Buttigieg, who was criticized along with Harris in Vance’s 2021 interview, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that the remarks came at a time when he and his husband, Chasten, “had been through a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey.”
    

            “He couldn’t have known that,” Buttigieg said, “but maybe that’s why you shouldn’t be talking about other people’s children.” (The Buttigiegs welcomed twins in late 2021.)
    

            Harris and Doug Emhoff married in 2014.
    

            “The thing about blended families,” Harris told CNN in 2020, “if everyone approaches it in the way that there’s plenty of love to share, then it works.”
    

            In a 2019 essay in Elle, Harris discussed becoming close friends with Kerstin Emhoff and sharing a blended family. “Kerstin and I hit it off ourselves and are dear friends,” Harris said. “… We sometimes joke that our modern family is almost a little too functional.”

CNN_66,How Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/polling-harris-voters-color-women/index.html,2024-07-25 07:16:00,politics,"
Kamala Harris seems to have more appeal among voters of color and younger voters than Joe Biden did before he got out of the presidential race. Still, the 2020 results show that Harris can make up even more ground with these groups in her expected matchup against Donald Trump.
    

            Take a look at our newly published CNN/SSRS poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 78% to 15%. Among these same voters (the poll recontacted the same respondents), Biden was ahead by a smaller 70% to 23% in CNN polling data from April and June.
    

            The same holds to a somewhat lesser degree among Hispanic voters. Harris comes in at 47% to Trump’s 45%, while it was 50% for Trump to 41% for Biden among these same respondents in the April and June data.
    

            Voters under the age of 35 demonstrate a similar shift. It’s Harris 47% to Trump’s 43% now. In April and June, these same voters put Trump up 49% to 42% over Biden.
    

            In some ways, none of these shifts are very surprising. Biden was doing the worst for a Democrat this century among all these traditionally Democratic-leaning groups. In fact, his performance among Hispanic and Black voters was the worst for a Democrat in over 50 years.
    

            Harris probably had nowhere to go but up with these segments of the electorate.

CNN Poll: Harris improves on Biden’s performance against Trump in early look at new matchup


            Despite the improvement, the results should leave much to be desired for Harris. She is doing at least 5 points worse than Biden did among these same groups in the final 2020 polls.
    

            Among Black voters, Biden led Trump 84% to 9% at the end of the 2020 campaign. Even more notable is that Biden led among Hispanic voters by a 58% to 32% spread.
    

            Finally, even as Harris has become a meme favorite among young voters, Biden’s 60% to 31% advantage over Trump at the end of the 2020 campaign is massively larger than where Harris is right now.
    

            (I should note the polling at this point in the 2020 campaign was similar to what the polls at the end of the campaign showed.)
    

            This may seem like bad news for the Harris campaign, and, in one clear way, it is. Without improving among these groups, Harris likely cannot win against the former president.
    

            The good news for Harris, though, is that she’s showing that she can make up some ground with this group relative to how Biden was doing earlier this year.
    

            As Harris continues to define herself separately from being Biden’s vice president, there’s a real chance she could carve out her own political identity that may appeal more to voters of color and young voters.
    

            The fact that Harris overperforms Biden among voters of color also provides her an opportunity to open up more paths in the Electoral College.
    

            Biden’s pathway to 270 electoral votes seemed rather limited. He was likely going to need to run the table in the northern battleground states by carrying Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. His polling in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina had been poor.
    

            If he won the northern battleground states and the other Democratic-leaning states (minus those aforementioned Sun Belt states), Biden would have gotten exactly the 270 electoral votes he needed to win.
    

            A big reason Biden struggled in those Sun Belt states is that each has a significant share of either Black or Hispanic voters. By doing better with those groups, Harris may reopen the possibility of more electoral paths.
    

            If, for instance, Harris won all four Sun Belt battlegrounds mentioned above, she wouldn’t need to carry Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
    

            Perhaps more likely, Harris could get to 270 electoral votes by winning some mixture of northern battlegrounds and Sun Belt swing states.
    

            The bottom line is that the latest CNN polling provides the Harris campaign with some hope. It’s not that Trump isn’t favored or that Harris doesn’t face an tough climb.
    

            Rather, Harris now has a bunch of paths toward victory, while Biden’s options seemed to be closing rather quickly.

CNN_67,What to know about the 25th Amendment as Trump makes wild claim about Biden,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/joe-biden-25th-amendment-what-matters/index.html,2024-07-25 07:01:00,politics,"
            President Joe Biden’s planned address to the nation on Wednesday night will be an opportunity to explain his decision not to run for reelection and show he is still up to the task of serving as president – a job he has for nearly six more months, until January 20, 2025.
    

            No matter what Biden says or how much his fellow Democrats try to build up his accomplishments as president, multiple Republicans have argued that the 25th Amendment to the Constitution should be used to remove Biden from office ASAP – something that’s not going to happen since no Democrat supports it.
    

            Former President Donald Trump, appearing at a rally in North Carolina Wednesday evening, made the unfounded claim that Biden was told by Democratic leaders that if he did not step aside in the election, he would be removed with the 25th Amendment.
    

            “The bosses, they said, ‘Either you get out, or we’re going to throw you out using the 25th Amendment,’” Trump said in prepared remarks opening his rally. While there’s no evidence to back up Trump’s wild claim about Biden, it is a verifiable fact that Trump’s own Cabinet considered the idea of using the 25th Amendment against him in 2021.
    

            Trump’s current running mate, Sen. JD Vance, said on Monday Democrats should use the 25th Amendment to remove Biden from office.
    

            “You don’t get to do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats,” he said on Fox News of Biden’s decision to end his presidential campaign. “If it’s an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way.”
    

            Talk about the 25th Amendment with regard to Biden has been percolating among Republicans, but it is a nonstarter among Democrats who have universally praised Biden for making the decision to step aside in the presidential election.
    

            Even before Biden dropped out of the race, Rep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, filed a resolution in June after the president’s disastrous debate performance, calling on the 25th Amendment to be used against Biden.

            On the morning Biden dropped out of the race, House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Republicans have discussed how to investigate whether Democrats engaged in wrongdoing for arguing Biden is up to the job of being president.
    

            “They – the Democrats have been involved in a big cover-up here,” Johnson said.
    

            After Biden withdrew from the race, Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican, wrote letters to Harris and the Cabinet officials in the Biden administration, asking them to remove Biden from office.
    

            “If President Biden is unwilling to resign, for the sake of our great nation, you must do your duty to relieve him of his constitutional powers and duties,” Schmitt wrote in a letter sent to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and posted on Schmitt’s website.
    

            The idea that Biden is unfit to serve is also in contrast to the Trump campaign’s argument that Biden should continue as the Democratic nominee; it filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission arguing Biden should not be able to transfer his campaign war chest to Vice President Kamala Harris.
    

            It’s hard to believe now that Republicans have reunified around Trump as their presidential candidate – and now that many of them doubt the severity of the January 6, 2021, insurrection – but use of the 25th Amendment was most recently seriously discussed with regard to Trump by his fellow Republicans that year.
    

Betsy DeVos, who was Trump’s secretary of education, confirmed to USA Today that she and other Trump Cabinet officials considered using the method to remove Trump from office. When it became clear to her that then-Vice President Mike Pence would not support the idea, she resigned from the Trump administration on January 7, 2021.
    

            “There were more than a few people who had those conversations internally,” she said.
    

Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has since recommitted himself to Trump and developed some amnesia about the severity of the January 6 attack, can be heard on a January 8, 2021, recording obtained by New York Times reporters in which he says the 25th Amendment can’t be used against Trump because it “takes too long.”
    

            It is, indeed, a complicated process, as we first investigated back in January 2021.
    

            To forcibly wrest power from a sitting president, the vice president would have to be on board, according to the text of the amendment. Read the full language here.
    

            Harris, who has consistently praised Biden and has shown absolutely no indication she thinks Biden is unfit for office, would also need a majority of Biden’s Cabinet officials to agree the president is unfit for office and temporarily seize power from him. Like Harris, they have also expressed complete support for him finishing his term.
    

            In the extremely unlikely event Biden’s allies were to turn on him, Biden could dispute their move with a letter to Congress. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days to dispute him, after which Congress would be called on to vote – it requires a two-thirds supermajority, usually 67 senators and 290 House members, to permanently remove the president.
    

            Congress could also appoint its own body to review the president’s fitness instead of the Cabinet. In 2020, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill to create a congressional body for this purpose with regard to Trump, but it was not signed into law.
    

            No president has ever been removed from office in this way. The amendment was ratified in 1965, in the wake of the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, whose predecessor Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered major heart attacks. It was meant to create a clear line of succession and prepare for urgent contingencies.
    

            Eisenhower suffered a debilitating heart attack while in office in the 1950s. That was before the 25th Amendment, so there was no constitutional rule. Instead, he came to an agreement with then-Vice President Richard Nixon about handing over power.
    

            The portion of the 25th Amendment that allows the vice president and Cabinet to remove the president had in mind a leader who was in a coma or suffered a stroke.
    

            The Reagan administration drafted, but did not sign or transmit, letters to the Senate that would have taken power from Reagan after he was shot in 1981. You can see them at the Reagan Library’s website.

CNN_68,"Fact check: Netanyahu falsely claims there have been ‘practically’ no civilian fatalities in Rafah, besides one incident",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fact-check-netanyahu-rafah-claims/index.html,2024-07-25 07:19:00,politics,"
            In his speech to Congress on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that during his recent visit to Rafah, when he asked how many civilians were killed in Rafah, the commander told him “practically none, with the exception of a single incident where shrapnel from a bomb hit a Hamas weapons depot and unintentionally killed two dozen people.”
    

Facts First: Netanyahu may have been told that, but the claim itself is verifiably false: Multiple strikes in Rafah have resulted in civilian casualties.


            The “incident” Netanyahu referenced occurred in May and killed at least 45 people at a camp for displaced Palestinians. The airstrike injured more than 200 after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics.
    

            In the same week of that strike, at least 29 Palestinians were killed in two separate Israeli attacks on displacement camps in Rafah, according to Palestinian and UN officials.
    

            CNN has seen firsthand video shot by stringers in Rafah and spoken to several health officials, humanitarian workers and eyewitnesses who have reported civilian fatalities as a result of Israel’s military assault on the southern city.
    

            Gaza’s Ministry of Health does not distinguish in its reporting between combatant and civilian deaths but has previously said that some 70% of casualties in all of Gaza have been women and children.

CNN_69,Missouri Supreme Court blocks release of man with overturned conviction as he was about to go free,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/us/missouri-christopher-dunn-released/index.html,2024-07-25 07:46:00,us,"
            The Missouri Supreme Court has blocked the immediate release of a man whose murder conviction was overturned — just as the man was about to walk free.
    

            A St. Louis Circuit Court judge had ordered Christopher Dunn to be released by 6 p.m. CDT Wednesday and threatened the prison warden with contempt if Dunn remained imprisoned. But the attorney general has been fighting his release.
    

            Corrections Department spokesperson Karen Pojmann said Dunn was signing paperwork to be released when the Missouri Supreme Court issued a stay, blocking his freedom. His wife was en route to pick him up.
    

            St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser’s decision to release Dunn came after he overturned Dunn’s murder conviction Monday, citing evidence of “actual innocence” in the 1990 killing. He ordered Dunn’s immediate release then, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed, and the state Department of Corrections declined to release him.
    

            St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion Wednesday urging the judge to immediately order Dunn’s freedom.
    

            “The Attorney General cannot unilaterally decide to ignore this Court’s Order,” Gore wrote.
    

            A court filing said an attorney for the Department of Corrections told a lawyer in Gore’s office that Bailey advised the agency not to release Dunn until the appeal plays out. When told it was improper to ignore a court order, the Department of Corrections attorney “responded that the Attorney General’s Office is legal counsel to the DOC and the DOC would be following the advice of counsel.”
    

            On Wednesday, Sengheiser said the prison in Licking had until 6 p.m. CST to release Dunn, or he would hold an order for the warden to be held in contempt of court.
    

            “Barring a new court order that supersedes the current court order, Mr. Dunn will be released before 6 p.m.,” Pojmann said in an email to The Associated Press, later texting that she expected him to be released in about an hour.
    

            “It shouldn’t be this hard,” said Dunn’s attorney, Tricia Rojo Bushnell, the executive director of the Midwest Innocence Projec
    

            Dunn’s wife told the AP she couldn’t believe the news.
    

            “I’m over the moon,” Kira Dunn said as she headed to the prison.
    

            “We’re so grateful to the judge. We’re so grateful that he didn’t allow his ruling to be disrespected that way and he put his foot down and said, ‘You will respect the rule of law and you will respect a court order.’”
    

            She said her husband looks forward to being freed after decades of longing to embrace his family for as long as he wants and having “a say in his own life.”
    

            “He wants to just feel free ground against his feet. He wants to walk barefoot. He wants to open and close doors as he chooses. He wants to select the temperature of his shower. He wants to go out in the middle of the night and look at the stars and just sit there. And, he wants to sleep in a real bed,” she said.
    

            Dunn’s situation is similar to what happened to Sandra Hemme.
    

            The 64-year-old woman spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of “actual innocence” and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the United States, according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme. Dunn was represented by the Midwest Innocence Project.
    

            But appeals by Bailey — all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court — kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center. During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn’t released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court with contempt of court on the table. She was released later that day.
    

            The judge also scolded Bailey’s office for calling the Chillicothe warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed on her own recognizance.
    

            Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. Gore’s office examined the case and filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.
    

            After weighing the case for nearly two months, Sengheiser issued a ruling that cited “a clear and convincing showing of ‘actual innocence’ that undermines the basis for Dunn’s convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.”
    

            Lawyers for Bailey’s office said at the hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they recanted as adults.
    

            A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. Although Bailey’s office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also did so at a hearing for Lamar Johnson, who spent 28 years in prison for murder. Another St. Louis judge ruled in February 2023 that Johnson was wrongfully convicted, and he was freed.
    

            Another hearing begins August 21 for death row inmate Marcellus Williams. Bailey’s office is opposing the challenge to Williams’ conviction, too. Timing is of the essence: Williams is scheduled to be executed September 24.
    

            St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in January to vacate the conviction of Williams for the fatal stabbing of Lisha Gayle in 1998. Bell’s motion said three experts determined that Williams’ DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.
    

            Steven Puro, professor emeritus of political science at St. Louis University, said Bailey is in a highly competitive race for the attorney general position with the primary quickly approaching on August 6.
    

            “Bailey is trying to show that he is quote, tough on crime, which is a very important Republican conservative position. Clearly, he’s angering members of the judicial system that he will have to argue before in the future. But he’s making the strategic notion that he needs to get his name before the voters and try to use that to win the primary election.”
    

            Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and chief justice, concurred with Puro’s observation, saying the handling of the case appears to be influenced by politics, also noting that the primary is quickly approaching.
    

            “Does Aug. 6 have anything to do with it?” he asked.
    

            “If there’s a finding of actual innocence and there’s no case left, then that’s all. Then it seems to me that it’s just whatever he believes and whatever his political instincts tell him to do. But one of the things is that no matter what your beliefs are, if a court orders something to happen, it’s not your purview to say no. The court has to be obeyed.”

CNN_70,US Department of Justice finalizes plea deal with Boeing,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/boeing-doj-plea-deal/index.html,2024-07-25 07:52:00,us,"
            The US Department of Justice on Wednesday for the first time shared details of its finalized plea deal agreement with Boeing, in which the troubled aviation company will plead guilty to a felony charge of defrauding the US government.
    

            Boeing agreed to pay a fine of $243.6 million as part of its plea agreement and admitted it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration when seeking permission for the troubled 737 Max plane to carry passengers. The plea deal is subject to approval of a federal judge.
    

            “We will continue to work transparently with our regulators as we take significant actions across Boeing to further strengthen our safety, quality and compliance programs,” Boeing said in a statement.
    

Boeing agreed to plead guilty two weeks ago to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes, in an agreement that many critics of Boeing – including crash victims’ families – slammed as a sweetheart deal.
    

            However, one additional condition detailed in a new filing on Wednesday is that Boeing’s board of directors will have to hold a meeting with victim families and their legal representatives within four months of the sentencing date.
    

            Boeing will also have to invest at least $455 million into its compliance, quality and safety programs, the agreement states.
    

            Boeing is to pay up to $487 million in fines — a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. It had already paid half the fine as part of the original plea deal in 2021. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the Justice Department said.
    

            The guilty plea and subsequent terms further hurt Boeing’s reputation. The company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes, beginning with the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets. And in January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet.

CNN_71,The British monarchy steps up efforts to go green with solar panels on palaces and biofuel-powered Bentleys,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/business/british-royal-family-eco-friendly-measures/index.html,2024-07-25 07:46:00,us,"
King Charles III was a champion of environmental causes long before he ascended to the British throne. And, fittingly, in the first full year of his reign, the British monarchy introduced a slew of measures to tackle its rising carbon emissions.
    

            According to the Royal Household’s latest accounts, published Wednesday, work has started on refurbishing the gas-powered lanterns at Buckingham Palace so they run on electricity, while Windsor Castle — where Prince Harry and Meghan wed in 2018 — has had solar panels fitted on its roof for the first time.
    

            The King’s two Bentleys will also be modified within the next year to run on biofuel, according to Britain’s PA Media. The Royal Household aims to transition to an “almost fully electric” fleet of vehicles eventually, the accounts said, without providing a target date.
    

            Whether biofuels used for vehicles reduce carbon emissions is contentious and depends on many factors, including their source. Some studies show that growing crops for fuel can emit more carbon than running a car on gasoline.

King Charles is bringing green ideas home to Sandringham


            According to the accounts, which cover the financial year ending March 31, the Royal Household will also partly use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for two new helicopters. The helicopters will allow the royal family to carry out their engagements in “remote regions of the UK that are not otherwise readily served” by other forms of transport.
    

            SAF has a lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels because it’s made from waste products, where the carbon has already been emitted, or from plants that absorb carbon dioxide as they grow.
    

            The long list of Charles’ environmental efforts over the years includes a proposal to install around 2,000 solar panels in the grounds of Sandringham Estate.
    

            It’s an ambitious plan, which, if implemented, will produce enough power to meet the “current and predicted future electricity demands” of the 20,000-acre royal residence, according to the proposal submitted by a planning agent on behalf of Sandringham Estate in April.
    

            Sandringham has been the private home of four generations of British monarchs since 1862. It is also where the royal family traditionally gathers to celebrate Christmas.
    

            The Royal Household has its work cut out on reducing pollution: the accounts released Wednesday showed that its overall carbon emissions rose 4% in the 2023-24 financial year to 5,994 tonnes (6,607 tons). That’s the equivalent of running more than 780 average homes in the United States.
    

            Separately, the accounts showed that the amount the monarchy received from British taxpayers — known as the Sovereign Grant — totaled £86.3 million ($111 million) for 2023-24, the same as the previous financial year. Most of this money is spent on maintaining the royal family’s properties and paying its staff.
    

            Under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the Crown Estate — which includes vast swathes of central London property as well as the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland — to the UK government in return for the Sovereign Grant.
    

            Crown Estate profits soared in the 2023-24 financial year to a record £1.1 billion ($1.4 billion), boosted by revenue from offshore wind projects.

CNN_72,Tesla stock tumbles after its profit plunged,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/tesla-earnings/index.html,2024-07-25 07:41:00,us,"
            Telsa profit in the second quarter plunged more than 40% from a year ago, as the electric vehicle company has faced both more EV competition from established automakers and a slowing of overall EV sales growth.
    

            The drop in profits is a stark contrast for a company that grew to become the world’s most valuable automaker on surging sales and profitability.
    

            The results underscore how Tesla, a pioneer in bringing electric vehicles to American drivers, now faces more intense competition from rivals at home and abroad. And with the EV market maturing, the growth in consumer interest for EVs has slowed.
    

            Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell about 12% Wednesday morning, dragging down the broader market. Tesla’s stock was down about 1% this year through Tuesday’s close, after falling as much as 44% earlier this year.
    

            Tesla reported adjusted income of $1.8 billiion in the quarter, or 52 cents a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of 61 cents a share, compared to the 91 cents a share it earned a year earlier. Its key measure of profit margin was sharply lower, as a series of price cuts on EVs took a toll.
    

            The April through June period was the second straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines for the company, its first-ever consecutive quarters of declining sales volume. The only previous quarter with a sales decline since Tesla went public came early in the pandemic, when stay-at-home orders forced its factories to close.
    

            Tesla did not give a new sales target for the full year. But it did warn that “In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.”

            Musk also said that the company would release more details on fully-automated robotaxis in October, rather than a previously planned August. The company calls its driver assist feature “Full Self Driving,” but that still requires drivers to be ready to take control of the car. Tesla still faces regulatory and technical hurdles before it can offer robotoxis without drivers, the company said in its earning statement.
    

            Musk said he still believes that is possible to achieve by the end of this year, and definitely by next year, but he cautioned: “My predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.”
    

            Tesla faces federal investigations into some of Musk’s claims about Full Self Driving capabilities. The company has also faced a Department of Justice inquiry in the past, although it’s unclear what the current status is of that investigation.
    

            He did announce Tesla’s plans to build an assembly plant in Mexico have been put on hold. The plans were announced more than a year ago, but Musk said the plans have now been paused until after the presidential election because of a threat by Republican nominee Donald Trump to slap tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico. Musk is a strong Trump supporter, both endorsing him and reportedly pledging tens of millions of dollars toward the former president’s re-election efforts. Trump vowed similar tariffs on Mexican-built cars in 2019, when he was president, but never followed through.

NYT_1,Netanyahu Delivers a Forceful Defense of Israel to Applause in Congress,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/netanyahu-congress.html,2024-07-25 04:28:00,,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday issued a full-throated defense of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, during an address to Congress that laid bare deep divisions in Washington over a war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
In a speech in which he angrily pushed back on criticism of Israel’s conduct of the war that has cleaved the Democratic Party and disrupted American college campuses, Mr. Netanyahu linked Israel’s security directly to that of the United States, insisting: “We’re not only protecting ourselves; we’re protecting you.”
“Our enemies are your enemies; our fight is your fight; and our victory will be your victory,” Mr. Netanyahu said, emphasizing the strategic role of Israel in countering Iran.
The fact of Mr. Netanyahu’s speech was almost as notable as anything he said. In the face of increasing international censure and dissent both in Israel and in the United States, Mr. Netanyahu was seeking to use Congress to lift his sagging political fortunes — and leaders in both parties obliged with a bipartisan invitation to receive him.
But in the House chamber as he spoke, there was clear evidence of how the longstanding bipartisan consensus to back Israel has eroded in Congress since the Hamas attack of Oct. 7 and the offensive in Gaza that followed. Dozens of Democratic members, including two top senators and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, boycotted the speech. Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside, as is traditional for the vice president, citing a scheduling conflict.
And Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and the first Palestinian American member of Congress, held up a sign as Mr. Netanyahu spoke that read “war criminal” on one side and “guilty of genocide” on the other.

NYT_2,Democrats Set Aug. 1 for Harris Nomination Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/democrat-nominee-date-kamala-harris.html,2024-07-25 04:30:00,,"Democrats on Wednesday took another step toward formally nominating Vice President Kamala Harris for president, with the rules committee for the party’s national convention setting Aug. 1 as the date that delegates are likely to begin voting.
In a virtual meeting, Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, and other party officials acknowledged the groundswell of support for Ms. Harris among its members and assured them that the party was dedicated to what one leader called an “open, fair and transparent” nominating process.
“We have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences through a vote,” Mr. Harrison said.
Candidates for the nomination will have until the evening of July 30 to show they have met the qualifying criteria, mainly by having acquired the support of at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state. No plausible Democrats have stepped forward to challenge Ms. Harris after President Biden exited the race on Sunday and quickly endorsed her. If she remains unopposed, the voting will begin online on Aug. 1. If she has a challenger, the voting could begin by Aug. 7.
The committee on Wednesday adopted the rules it will use to formally choose its next nominee. The draft of those nominating rules was first released on Tuesday.
The rules vote followed more than an hour of discussion in which several members cited the gravity of the moment, saying Republicans could challenge the rules in lawsuits as they seek to knock their new nominee off state ballots.
“Republicans will use this moment to do what they do, to sue, to try to bar us from the ballot or to try to disqualify our voters, and to suggest that somehow the party’s nominating process was improper,” said Pat Moore, the committee’s outside counsel. “This threat is quite real.”
Ms. Harris has drawn support from all corners of her party, including former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, top congressional and party leaders and every Democratic governor in the country. The Associated Press said late Monday that Ms. Harris had secured the backing of more than the 1,976 delegates needed to capture the nomination in the first round of voting.

NYT_3,Whale Capsizes Fishing Boat Off New Hampshire Coast,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/whale-boat-capsize-new-hampshire.html,2024-07-25 03:30:00,,"A humpback whale that an expert said was looking for food breached the water and landed on a recreational boat near Portsmouth, N.H., on Tuesday, capsizing the vessel and ejecting two passengers, the United States Coast Guard said.
The Northern New England sector of the Coast Guard received a mayday call for a 23-foot boat that had capsized when a whale shot up from underneath the boat and flopped onto it, about half a mile east of Odiorne Point State Park.
The dramatic flip was caught on video by Colin Yager, 16, who was out fishing on another boat nearby, according to WHDH in Boston. He sped over to rescue the two boaters in the water, neither of whom were injured. The whale also appeared to be uninjured, the Coast Guard said.
“It’s was a harrowing experience,” Gregg Paquette, one of the two passengers knocked over by the whale, told WHDH. He continued, “We were lucky; we were really lucky.”Mr. Paquette told the local news station that he was out bait fishing with Ryland Kenney when the whale came from underneath the back of the boat and collapsed onto the stern. Mr. Kenney said the episode happened within a matter of seconds.
“I was probably about three feet from the whale’s head, and I saw him come up and open his mouth,” Mr. Kenney said. “I think that’s when I was like, ‘Whoa,’ and his mouth closed and it crunched the engine.”
That’s when the Yager brothers turned their boat around to rescue their fellow fishermen.
“I just dropped everything and just started driving over to them,” Wyatt Yager, 19, told WHDH. “They swam around to the back and climbed up the ladder.”
Dianna Schulte, a co-founder and director of research at the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation in Portsmouth, said the whale was likely feeding on bait fish.
“It’s feeding season for many large whales, like humpbacks, who don’t eat during their winter breeding season in the Caribbean. This whale wasn’t ‘angry’ — it was hungry,” she wrote in a statement posted to social media. “Boaters happened to be in the area at the same time.”“If you see a whale, don’t approach it, or leave your fishing line in the water,” she added. “Lines can entangle whales, and whales can damage your boat.”
In an email, Ms. Schulte said the whale appeared to be a juvenile and about 30 feet long, adding that her group had not been able to match it to an animal seen in those waters before.
Humpback whales, known for being found close to shore and balletic breaches, are a favorite of whale watchers. During the warmer months, they spend most of their time feeding and building up fat for winter."
NYT_4,What’s More Exciting Than a Veepstakes? A Surprise Veepstakes.,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/harris-vice-president-search.html,2024-07-25 02:40:00,,"Over three chaotic weeks, America lived through an assassination attempt, a political convention and a dramatic exit from the presidential ticket. But even — or perhaps especially — in these wild times, the political world is clinging to what it knows: lists of names and wild speculation.
Although Vice President Kamala Harris has officially been a presidential candidate for less than four days, the parlor game over her running mate is well underway.
The contenders are still getting used to the attention.
“Are we not talking about concrete anymore, or what?” asked Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, speaking at a Monday event hosted by an asphalt manufacturer outside Pittsburgh.
The governor, whose name frequently tops the roster of potential picks, proceeded to dodge 13 minutes of shouted questions about his vice-presidential aspirations — or lack thereof.“I’m happy to try to answer your questions — I just have to hear them one at a time,” he said to a crowd of reporters that included journalists from national TV networks, adding, “I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals.”
Efforts to select a vice-presidential nominee always incite a firestorm of unfounded predictions stoked furiously by busybodies and blowhards. There are, of course, the infamous lists — real and speculative — of prospective candidates, which fuel breathless reporting on the possibilities. Planes are tracked, schedules are scoured and even minor players suddenly transform into figures “close to the candidate.”

NYT_5,Harris Warns Black Women That Trump Is a Threat to Children and Families,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/harris-trump-black-women.html,2024-07-25 03:25:00,,"Vice President Kamala Harris made an appeal on Wednesday to the Democratic Party’s most loyal voting bloc, Black women, telling an audience of several thousand in Indianapolis that Donald J. Trump’s agenda represented “an outright attack on our children, our families and our future.”
Ms. Harris’s pointed speech, delivered at a convention of Zeta Phi Beta, one of the nation’s most prominent Black sororities, laid out a “choice between two different visions for our nation.”
One vision — hers — would build on a series of what she described as the Biden administration’s biggest accomplishments: expanding access to health care, lowering the cost of prescription drugs like insulin, reducing child poverty and creating an economy that “works for working people.”
The other, she warned, would return the United States to a “dark past,” with cuts to Medicare and the elimination of the Department of Education and popular programs like Head Start.“These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back. We are not going back,” Ms. Harris, a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, said again with emphasis, in a banquet hall filled almost exclusively by Black women. “Ours is a fight for the future, and ours is a fight for freedom.”"
NYT_6,How Kamala Harris Took Command of the Democratic Party in 48 Hours,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-democrats-nomination.html,2024-07-25 02:29:00,,"Late on Sunday morning, Vice President Kamala Harris summoned a small clutch of her closest advisers and allies to the Naval Observatory, where she lives and works, with little notice and even less information.
President Biden had informed Ms. Harris earlier that morning that he was withdrawing from the race. The vice president had assembled her team so that the exact moment Mr. Biden formally quit, at 1:46 p.m. — one minute after the president had informed his own senior staff — they were ready to go.
Time was of the essence. A sprawling call list of the most important Democrats to reach had been prepared in advance, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The vice president, in sneakers and a sweatshirt, began methodically dialing Democratic power brokers.
“I wasn’t going to let this day go by without you hearing from me,” Ms. Harris had said over and over, as day turned to night, according to five people who received her calls or were briefed on them.She phoned past Democratic presidents, many of her potential rivals — including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, JB Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania — the Democratic congressional leaders, Senator Bernie Sanders, the heads of the various influential caucuses and other top Democrats, a person with direct knowledge of the call list said.
The blitz demonstrated exactly the kind of vigor and energy that Mr. Biden had lacked in recent weeks. Mr. Biden had reportedly made 20 calls to congressional Democrats in the first 10 or so days after the debate, while his candidacy hung in the balance. Ms. Harris made 100 calls in 10 hours.

NYT_8,"On Economic Policy, Harris Has Played Limited Role",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-economic-policy.html,2024-07-25 01:50:00,,"Shortly after the Biden administration took office in 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris started calling the chief executives of large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The federal government was making hundreds of billions of dollars available for banks to lend to small businesses to keep them afloat during the pandemic recession. Ms. Harris told the executives they needed to be lending more, faster, particularly to minority-owned businesses that data suggested were struggling to gain access to the money.
The calls represented one of the earliest and most visible forays Ms. Harris made in devising and carrying out the Biden administration’s economic agenda, and illustrated the sort of economic policy niche that she has filled as vice president.
Current and former administration officials, progressive leaders outside the White House and allies of Ms. Harris roundly agree that the vice president, who is now the leading candidate to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, did not play a major role in the creation of the sweeping economic legislation that has defined President Biden’s time in office.Ms. Harris was rarely a loud voice in major economic debates, like the ones over how to counter soaring inflation in 2021 and 2022. She did sometimes attend economic briefings, but was not always a big contributor in them. One attendee recalled her coming to an economic briefing, but simply listening to the presentation while Mr. Biden asked questions.
Other officials say Ms. Harris largely focuses her questions for economists on how certain policies affect workers and families at a personal level — a trait she shares with the president.

NYT_9,Book Prompts Investigation Into Nashville’s Unsolved Civil Rights-Era Bombings,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/nashville-civil-rights-bombings.html,2024-07-25 01:29:00,,"The Nashville police moved to reopen investigations into three unsolved bombings that took place during the Civil Rights era, a spokeswoman said, after a local author published a book this month that said the attacks were carried out by a terrorist network with ties to the Ku Klux Klan.
The author, Betsy T. Phillips, identified possible suspects in the book and linked the three bombings, which targeted an elementary school that was integrating, a Jewish community center and a prominent civil rights lawyer’s home.
Since the book, “Dynamite Nashville: Unmasking the FBI, the KKK, and the Bombers Beyond Their Control,” was released on July 16 by Third Man Books, the publishing imprint started by the musician Jack White, people have come forward to share information about the bombings, Ms. Phillips said.
“The fact that people are like, ‘finally, I have somebody to tell this thing I have been carrying around with me’ — that’s really exciting,” Ms. Phillips said.The Nashville Metropolitan Police Department is in the “preliminary stages” of reopening the investigations, said a police spokeswoman, Kristin Mumford. “We are looking at how best to go about doing that,” she said.
The mayor of Nashville, Freddie O’Connell, announced at an event for the book on July 13 that he had asked the police to assign an investigator from the cold case unit to lead the investigation into the bombings.

NYT_10,Nephew Says Trump Suggested Some Disabled People ‘Should Just Die’,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/donald-trump-nephew-book-fred-trump.html,2024-07-25 00:46:00,,"In 2020, a few months before the last election, former President Donald J. Trump’s niece, Mary Trump, published a book about her uncle and how awful and psychologically warped she found him to be. At the time, her brother, Fred C. Trump III, put out a statement slamming his sister for such treachery.
Now, he’s wielding the knife. Next week, he will publish “All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got to Be This Way,” a tell-all that puts the former president in a harsh light. The New York Times obtained a copy.
Fred and Mary Trump are the children of Fred Trump Jr., Donald’s older brother who struggled with alcoholism and died of a heart attack in 1981, when he was 42.
Fred Trump, 61, describes himself as fairly close to his uncle. He attended the 2017 inauguration (he writes that he had a better seat than John McCain) and visited the White House several times (the book includes a picture of its author sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office).Once, while in the Oval Office, the elder Mr. Trump insisted that his nephew stay in the room for a phone call he was about to have with King Abdullah of Jordan. He put the call on speakerphone, so his nephew could hear the king thank Mr. Trump for killing an Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. “I killed him,” the former president boasted in front of his nephew, according to the book. “I killed him like a dog.”
But another White House meeting left the author with a chill, and, it is implied, the reason for writing the book.

NYT_11,Gunman Searched ‘How Far Away Was Oswald From Kennedy?’ Before Trump Shooting,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/fbi-director-wray-trump-shooting-hearing.html,2024-07-25 04:04:00,,"The gunman who tried to kill former President Donald J. Trump searched online for details of John F. Kennedy’s assassination a week before the shooting, apparently typing “How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?” the director of the F.B.I. told lawmakers on Wednesday.
The disclosure by the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, to the House Judiciary Committee, appeared to be a possible first indication that the shooter began to contemplate an assassination. That same day, July 6, he appears to have registered to attend the rally in Butler, Pa., where Mr. Trump was set to speak, Mr. Wray added.
“That’s a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,” Mr. Wray said, noting that the gunman’s interest in public figures around that time “became very focused on former President Trump and this rally.”
Even as Mr. Wray cautioned that the investigation was still continuing, he disclosed several new details about the shooting.The gunman visited the site of the rally the next day, July 7, one of three visits Mr. Wray detailed. In the first, he spent about 20 minutes at the scene. He returned twice on the day of the shooting, July 13, for about 70 minutes in the morning, and then later that afternoon, when he appeared to fly a drone in the vicinity for about 11 minutes.
“It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4:00, in that window, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,” Mr. Wray said, noting that it was “not over the stage, but about 200 yards, give or take, away from that.”

NYT_12,How to Watch President Biden’s Address From the Oval Office Tonight,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/biden-speech-tonight.html,2024-07-25 03:02:00,,"President Biden will address the nation tonight for the first time since ending his re-election campaign on Sunday and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the Democratic ticket, a decision that has reset the party’s once-bleak political outlook.
Mr. Biden will address the nation at 8 p.m. Eastern from the Oval Office.
The New York Times will stream Mr. Biden’s speech, alongside real-time commentary and analysis from reporters. USA Today and C-SPAN also plan to stream it live.
Most television news outlets, including ABC, are expected to carry Mr. Biden’s address. He is the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek a second term.
Mr. Biden, who had been recovering from the coronavirus at his Delaware beach home, has been mostly out of sight since last week. He announced his decision to drop out of the race in a letter posted on X. On Monday, Mr. Biden called into a meeting led by Ms. Harris at the Wilmington, Del., headquarters of what used to be their joint campaign and insisted that he would be “fully, fully engaged” in helping to get her elected."
NYT_13,Black Sororities and Fraternities Line Up Behind Kamala Harris,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/kamala-harris-sorority.html,2024-07-25 03:34:00,,"As Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign rushes to shore up its base, its efforts will be bolstered by a ready-made coalition: the more than two million members of Black Greek-letter organizations who have quickly united to mobilize Black voters nationwide.
Before Ms. Harris had even hosted her first official campaign event as the de facto Democratic nominee, the heads of the “Divine Nine,” the country’s nine most prominent Black sororities and fraternities, were planning a giant voter organization effort. When President Biden announced on Sunday that he was stepping aside and endorsing Ms. Harris, excitement over her ascent spread swiftly among these groups’ members in group chats, Facebook groups and conference calls.
After all, Ms. Harris, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha since her undergraduate days at Howard University, is one of them.
“Greek letter organizations who have worked in the trenches, some for over 100 years, never received any kind of publicity, any kind of notoriety,” said Representative Frederica S. Wilson of Florida, who is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. Once Ms. Harris ran for president, in 2020, she said, that changed. “The A.K.A.s shouted to the highest hills, ‘That’s our soror! That’s our sister!’”On Wednesday, Ms. Harris addressed members of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority at their Boulé, or annual national gathering, in Indianapolis — her first such event as the Democratic Party’s likely standard-bearer.
As Ms. Harris took the stage, members cheered as the sorority’s president, Stacie N.C. Grant, said their organization was the first Divine Nine sorority to host the nation’s first Black female presidential nominee. Though billed as an official White House event, Ms. Harris delivered an energetic version of her campaign stump speech, imploring the Black women present — a group long considered the backbone of the Democratic Party — to help her build on Mr. Biden’s record.

But after President Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed her as his replacement, Mr. Kearney set his misgivings aside — and opened his wallet.
“I’m all the way in,” declared Mr. Kearney, 41, who said he sent $20 to Ms. Harris’s campaign this week. 
Nathan Gaines, a 43-year-old barber and Army veteran from Milwaukee, said he had been leaning toward voting for Donald J. Trump — he calls the former president “Big T” — despite having supported Democrats in every election since Barack Obama became president.
But the prospect of Harris at the top of the ticket was making him rethink that switch. Mr. Gaines now says he is open to at least considering her. “If Kamala steps up, that would change history,” he said. “I’d give her a shot.”Black voters propelled Mr. Biden’s candidacy in 2020. And many remained loyal to him even after his dismal debate performance last month. But, like other Americans, their doubts about his ability to lead the party’s ticket were growing before he bowed out of the race on Sunday."
NYT_15,Trump’s 2024 Convention Speech Had More Falsehoods Than His 2016 One,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/24/us/politics/trump-rnc-fact-check.html,2024-07-24 17:03:00,,"Former President Donald J. Trump’s penchant for fabrication and hyperbole has long been a core tenet of his bombastic persona and political messaging. Two campaigns, one term in the Oval Office and eight years later, Mr. Trump has loosened his grasp on the facts even more.
A comparison of his addresses before the Republican National Convention in 2016 and 2024 demonstrates how his relationship to the truth has changed, offering a glimpse of how he will likely cast himself on the campaign trail as he seeks to reclaim the White House.
In 2016, when he accepted the nomination after a bitter primary campaign, with doubts and skepticism lingering over his candidacy, Mr. Trump hewed closely to his prepared remarks and paid some heed to the facts.
Last Thursday, he stood before a party altered in his image, after four nights of allies, friends and former foes repeating falsehoods and exaggerations that have become a staple of his speeches, rallies and social media posts.As a result, the address Mr. Trump gave in 2024 was akin to one he might deliver at a rally, and almost twice as long as his speech in 2016 by the amount of words. The number of inaccurate claims also doubled, according to a New York Times analysis. In the span of two minutes of his acceptance speech this year, he rattled off five exaggerated or false claims.
Here’s a breakdown.
Whereas many of Mr. Trump’s claims eight years ago contained a kernel of truth or simply omitted context, many of his claims during his acceptance speech last week were flat-out false.

The rows of seats on the Democratic side of the House chamber will be conspicuously emptier than those on the Republican side.
And tensions are running so high that Speaker Mike Johnson has threatened to have anyone who causes a disturbance on the floor or in the gallery above arrested.
When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel arrives on Capitol Hill on Wednesday afternoon to address a joint meeting of Congress, he will confront a legislative body divided over his leadership in the face of international censure over the war in Gaza, with some showing open hostility to the government of a country that is supposed to be among the United States’ closest allies.
“I will seek to anchor the bipartisan support that is so important for Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said before departing Israel for his visit to Washington.In reality, his visit will underscore the rifts in Congress, particularly among Democrats, over the Israel-Hamas war at a moment when the party is seeking to unite around Ms. Harris as its presumptive presidential nominee. She declined to preside over Mr. Netanyahu’s speech, as is traditional for the vice president, citing a scheduling conflict.
She is only the most high-profile Democrat who will be absent — empty seats on one side of the chamber will represent the well of anger from the party’s progressive base about Mr. Netanyahu’s conduct of the war with Hamas.

With much of the country’s focus already shifted to Vice President Harris’s rapid ascent as Democrats’ likely presidential nominee, Biden intends to show Americans that he still plans to make an impact during his final months in office.“There’s been a feeling that Joe Biden has disappeared from the scene and everybody is doing a eulogy for him,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “Yet he’s still our president all the way until January. He wants to use the prime-time television address to remind people that our country is still in good stead under his leadership.”1/5The speech will be the first opportunity for Biden to more fully explain why he decided to drop out of the race, a move that made him the first president since 1968 to voluntarily opt against seeking another term. In his letter making the announcement on Sunday, Biden offered few details on his thought process.“And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in the letter.Previously, the 81-year-old Biden had dismissed questions about his advanced age and sluggish poll numbers, defiantly rejecting calls for him to step aside. His abrupt reversal upended an already turbulent campaign against Republican nominee Donald Trump, elevating Harris into the role of Democrats’ de facto leader.As he adjusts to his new role as a lame duck, one-term president, there are signs that Biden is hoping to ramp up his presidential activity even as he prepares for the sunset of his half-century career in Washington.“I won’t be on the ticket, but I’m still going to be fully, fully engaged,” Biden told a group of campaign staff on Monday. “I’m determined to get [as] much done as I possibly can — both foreign policy and domestic policy.”In what could be a preview of his Oval Office address, Biden focused specifically on Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, where his administration has been pushing for a cease-fire agreement that would result in the release of hostages held by Hamas since last October. Efforts to secure such a deal have intensified in recent days, coinciding with Wednesday’s visit to Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Biden has signaled that a hostage release — which would include several Americans — was on the “verge” of being a reality.The president plans to meet with Netanyahu to discuss the cease-fire agreement on Thursday, a sign of the key role he would still play in world affairs.“We’re still fighting in this fight together,” he told the campaign staffers on Monday. “I’m not going anywhere.”Still, it is not clear how much his decision to bow out of the presidential race will change his schedule going forward. Biden, who was out of sight for five days as he recovered from covid, has continued to maintain a relatively light schedule. He had been set to travel to Texas, California and Colorado this week for campaigning and fundraising but canceled all of that travel. He plans to spend the weekend at Camp David, and aides said some of the canceled events would be rescheduled.Republicans have responded to Biden’s exit from the race by calling on him to resign the presidency altogether, suggesting that if he is not capable of running a reelection race he should not remain in the White House. Some amplified conspiracy theories that he had died or was gravely ill.Trump took to social media Tuesday to question whether Biden “is fit to run the U.S.A. for the next six months?”Biden and his aides have forcefully pushed back on the idea that the president has been sidelined or otherwise diminished. The prime-time Oval Office address, just the fourth of his presidency, is designed to give the president a national platform to frame his time in office and tout his long list of accomplishments while also offering a boost to the woman who is now Democrats’ likely nominee.Biden’s low-profile of late has had the effect of ceding the spotlight to Harris, who has been traveling the country to jump-start her presidential campaign. She used a keynote speech to more than 6,000 Black women on Wednesday to offer gratitude for his endorsement and to preview his speech.“He will talk about not only the work, the extraordinary work that he has accomplished, but about his work for the next six months,” Harris told a gathering of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority in Indianapolis. “Joe Biden is a leader with bold vision. He cares about the future. He thinks about the future.”In recent days, Harris’s campaign has been buoyed by a surge in enthusiasm, fundraising and support — all of which had been lacking in Biden’s campaign amid concerns about his age and health.While the success or failure of Harris’s candidacy against Trump could determine the durability of Biden’s legacy and legislative record — much of which Trump has vowed to overturn in a second term — he must also grapple with the idea that his vice president has suddenly become a more influential figure in the Democratic Party.But Biden’s decision to speak from the Oval Office, where presidents have often announced consequential developments on matters of domestic or global significance, highlights his ongoing role and powers, Brinkley said.“He is a lame duck president legislatively, but he can still sign executive orders and be a world leader in trying to seek a cease-fire in the Middle East and continue funding to achieve liberation for Ukraine,” the historian noted. “He may have lost some stature here at home, but in the world of foreign policy, he’s more important than ever.”"
WaPo_2,What to know about the NBA and WNBA’s new TV and streaming deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/nba-wnba-nbc-amazon-espn-rights/,2024-07-25 04:37:19.122200,,"The NBA and WNBA on Wednesday announced a slew of media rights deals worth around $76 billion over 11 years that will keep the NBA Finals on ESPN and ABC, while adding new partners in Amazon and NBC.Not all the deal is official yet. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns longtime NBA partner TNT Sports, informed the league this week that it has exercised what it believes to be matching rights for the Amazon deal. The league rejected that match and a legal fight could be ahead. Still, the league is pushing ahead full-steam.The agreements, which are set to begin after next season, amount to an incredible windfall for the leagues and are expected to lead to the first $100-million players in American sports. Here’s everything you need to know.Disney-owned ESPN and ABC will continue to broadcast the largest NBA package of games, including the NBA Finals and one conference finals each year. But the league will have two new partners: Amazon and NBC, which will alternate broadcasting the other conference finals each year.During the regular season, Peacock will exclusively broadcast games on Monday night, and Amazon will broadcast games on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. NBC will also air the All-Star Game.NBC will be an NBA partner for the first time since it aired games throughout the 1990s, when its theme song, “Round Ball Rock,” and Michael Jordan’s heyday were part of a golden age for the league. Amazon continues its push into live sports to help its burgeoning ads business after inking Thursday Night Football two years ago.As for fans, they will now need a cable package, broadcast antenna and subscriptions to ESPN Plus, Peacock and Amazon Prime to watch NBA games.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The WNBA, on the heels of the league’s exploding popularity and TV ratings, is set to receive $2.2 billion over 11 years, according to a person familiar with the figures. The NBA negotiated this deal on behalf of both the WNBA and NBA. The amount represents a substantial increase from the current media deals for the league, which are valued at around $60 million and will help the league increase player salaries and put the league and its team on better financial footing.There are two additional WNBA packages, currently on ION and CBS, that will be negotiated later this year and are expected to raise the total value of the WNBA’s broadcast rights.The WNBA Finals will rotate between NBC networks, ESPN/ABC and Amazon.Big bucks. Disney is paying nearly double the amount of its previous deal, up to $2.6 billion per year from $1.4 billion in its current deal. NBC will pay $2.5 billion and Amazon around $1.8 billion each year. The staggering amounts are far above the national TV deals for Major League Baseball ($1.9 billion per year) and the NHL ($625 million), though still behind the NFL., which nets over $10 billion per year.The NBA’s regular season TV ratings have declined by some 30 percent over the last 10 years, which caused some media prognosticators to question how much the NBA would be able to collect in its new deals. But those dips don’t look so bad compared to entertainment television. According to Sportico, the four broadcast networks lost 80 percent of their prime-time viewers in the 18-49 age demographic over the same time period.In a continually fragmenting media landscape, the NBA is leaning heavily on broadcast TV, with NBC and ABC, and streaming, while moving away from cable. The league took advantage of traditional media companies that are squeezing what they can out of the old models of distribution and streaming platforms that want to use live sports to draw new subscribers.The Amazon piece of the deal isn’t buttoned up because TNT remains a wild card. TNT Sports believes it has the right to match Amazon’s portion of the deal and informed the NBA it was doing so this week. The NBA rejected TNT’s matching attempt, saying that TNT failed to explicitly match the terms of the deal.Warner can now mull its options, including suing the league. One thing is certain: There will be lawyers, and likely a lot of billable hours.If Warner’s quest to hang on to the NBA is unsuccessful, it will save billions of dollars but will still need to find programming that ensures that cable providers still pay a premium price to carry TNT. The network has inked a number of smaller deals to broadcast the French Open and Big East basketball in coming years and has sub-licensed multiple College Football Playoff games from ESPN.Sir Charles is arguably the best known sports broadcaster in the country. He joined TNT after he retired and has been with the network for more than 20 years. If TNT’s legal challenges don’t net the network any NBA games, he will have one more season left on TNT’s pre- and postgame show, “Inside the NBA.” He has suggested he may retire after that, but he has threatened retirement before and will almost certainly get a few offers from the NBA’s remaining media partners."
WaPo_3,"Lewis Lapham, editor who revived Harper’s magazine, dies at 89",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/24/lewis-lapham-harpers-dead/,2024-07-25 04:22:19.122200,,"Lewis H. Lapham, the innovative editor who revived Harper’s magazine and who penned books and essays that skewered the American upper class from which he sprang, died July 23 in Rome. He was 89.His family confirmed the death but did not cite a specific cause.Born into a family with a long history in statecraft and industry — relatives included the secretary of war for Thomas Jefferson and a founder of what became the oil giant Texaco — Mr. Lapham retained the aura of extreme privilege. On his tall, trim frame, he wore bespoke suits, accessorized with pocket squares and cuff links. He could often be found, drink in hand and chain-smoking Parliament cigarettes, at A-list galas and restaurants in New York.At the same time, he positioned himself as an often-scornful observer of his own aristocratic heritage, leading to quips that he was “the Brahmin who got away.”He aspired to be a historian and was studying the subject at the University of Cambridge when, in 1956, the Suez crisis broke out as well as the anti-Soviet uprising in Hungary, and he found himself drawn to the thrill and immediacy of documenting history as it unfolded.“I couldn’t imagine anything more exciting to do than to try to put words on paper,” he told the design and culture website Print, describing journalism as a form of public service and a “heroic” forum for ideas.But by the time Mr. Lapham joined Harper’s as a contract writer in 1971 — after assignments for Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post — the venerable monthly founded in 1850 was losing readers and advertisers.In a dispute with the owner over editorial direction and budgetary conflicts, the entire staff except for the art director followed the beloved top editor Willie Morris out the door, a mutiny that Mr. Lapham likened to “one of those Shakespeare plays where all the important people kill themselves.”Although he had only been to the Harper’s office twice, Mr. Lapham was suddenly promoted to managing editor by the magazine’s owner, the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co., which had taken issue with Morris’s free-spending ways and articles like Norman Mailer’s 90,000-word report on a Vietnam War protest march.Mr. Lapham turned the once reliably liberal Harper’s into what he called a “theater of ideas.” He published essays by leftists but also reached out to conservatives such as Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz and Ken Adelman. He ran articles questioning affirmative action and once put William F. Buckley Jr., the right-wing editor of the National Review, on the cover.“What drew Lapham to these writers was his taste for heresy — he’s always loved starting fights on the playground and then bringing them back into the classroom,” media critic Jack Schafer wrote decades later in Slate. “Publishing contrary pieces gave Harper’s an ecumenical edge.”Mr. Lapham, who became Harper’s top editor in 1976, also encouraged writers to provide their personal takes on U.S. politics, world affairs, science and the arts. He published some of Tom Wolfe’s most incendiary work, including “The Painted Word,” his 1975 attack on modern art, and was an early promoter of Annie Dillard’s meditative essays on nature.“He pushed the idea that the memoir form might influence any piece — an essay, report, investigation — and make it more, rather than less, true,” Robert S. Boynton, head of the literary journalism program at New York University, told Smithsonian magazine. “He attacked the false gods of ‘objective journalism,’ and showed how much more artful and accurate writing in the first person could be.”There were also blunders. Because he objected to the book’s many unnamed sources, Mr. Lapham refused to excerpt “All the President’s Men,” the soon-to-be bestseller by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward about the Watergate break-in that led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.What’s more, Harper’s continued to bleed cash. It was on the verge of closing in 1980 when it was bought by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the oil company Atlantic Richfield. The new owners set up a nonprofit foundation to underwrite the magazine.The next year, the board reportedly pushed Mr. Lapham to resign in part because some found the magazine’s contents lacked liveliness and were too often harshly critical of American society. When his successor, Michael Kinsley, also left amid clashes with the board, Mr. Lapham was lured back in 1983 with a carte blanche mandate to redesign Harper’s.“The board brought him back because the magazine started going downhill after he left, and they didn’t want to ruin the Harper’s brand,” said Samir Husni, a magazine industry analyst. Mr. Lapham, he added, “gave the magazine its identity.”In his second stint as editor, Mr. Lapham tried to distinguish Harper’s from competitors, like the New Yorker and the Atlantic, by cutting back on windy articles and by inventing several short, eye-catching features.The “Annotation” section deciphered random documents and images — a census form, a White House press release, a Carnegie Hall concert ticket — through critical comment and explanatory diagrams. “Harper’s Index” came about after Mr. Lapham noted that news stories were often built around numbers. He stripped away the words to produce a single page of numbers and unusual facts often juxtaposed to startle or amuse readers.One Index entry dryly stated: “Pounds of plutonium and highly enriched uranium that are missing from U.S. inventories: 9,600 pounds. Pounds of plutonium needed to make an atomic bomb: 15.” Another put the number of “telephone-related injuries” in 1985 at 11,000. The Index was widely imitated and turned into a series of books.Mr. Lapham filled out Harper’s with poetry, fiction, and in-depth reports, often by emerging voices such as David Foster Wallace, Christopher Hitchens and Fareed Zakaria. Barbara Ehrenreich recalled how a long lunch with Mr. Lapham led her to write two Harper’s essays on the struggles of America’s working class and that formed the basis for her best-selling 2001 book “Nickel and Dimed.”Mr. Lapham led off each edition of Harper’s with one of his own essays, written longhand with a Waterman pen, often about the abuse of privilege and power and the dangers facing America’s democracy.Although the magazine continued to lose money, circulation nearly doubled to 220,000. Under his watch, Harper’s won the National Magazine Award, the industry’s highest honor, many times, including in 1995 for Mr. Lapham’s essays, which were praised for their “exhilarating point of view in an age of conformity.”In 2007, a year after stepping down as editor of Harper’s, Mr. Lapham was inducted into the American Society of Magazine Editors Hall of Fame. At the ceremony, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recalled seeing the patrician Mr. Lapham at the Manhattan literary hangout Elaine’s, confused by the stunning woman who appeared to be a model showering him with attention — until she learned he was editor of Harper’s, not Harper’s Bazaar.Lewis Henry Lapham was born in San Francisco on Jan. 8, 1935. His father was in shipping and banking, and his paternal grandfather was mayor of San Francisco in the 1940s. As a boy, he sometimes rode with him in official limousines to ribbon-cutting ceremonies.“I came to imagine,” he later observed, “that I was born to ride in triumph and that others, apparently less fortunate and more numerous, were born to stand smiling in the streets and wave their hats.”His grandfather, also a high-stakes gambler, ultimately frittered away much of the family fortune, and Mr. Lapham described himself as someone “brought up with the attitude of somebody affluent, but without the funds.”He graduated in 1952 from the private Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and from Yale University in 1956 with an English degree. He then studied history at Cambridge but dropped out after six months. As he explained to the Kansas City Star, “I didn’t have the patience for footnotes, and I didn’t want to have to learn medieval German.”Instead, he took a job in 1957 as a cub reporter for his hometown San Francisco Examiner, where his tasks included procuring bourbon for the better-known writers. Sent to cover a flower show, Mr. Lapham watched in horror as an editor cut his 4,000-word treatise down to a single paragraph.After three years at the Examiner, followed by two more at the New York Herald Tribune, Mr. Lapham turned to magazine writing because he found traditional newspaper coverage too confining for his worldly tastes. One assignment for the Saturday Evening Post took him to India to write about the Beatles as they studied Transcendental Meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Four decades later, he detailed the experience in his book “With the Beatles.”Survivors include his wife of more than 50 years, the former Joan Reeves, of Rome; three children, Andrew Lapham of Toronto, Delphina Boncompagni Ludovisi of Rome and Winston Lapham of Denver; and 10 grandchildren.In addition to his regular presence on TV talk shows, Mr. Lapham introduced “America’s Century,” a six-part series for public television in 1989 that traced the sudden rise and eventual decline of American power in the 20th century. From 1988 to 1991, he hosted “Bookmark,” a weekly public TV program about new literature.The focus of many of his own books — he wrote 14, some of which were collections of his Harper’s columns — was what he considered America’s obsession with wealth and material possessions, which he called a “civil religion.”Several critics noted that such assertions were based more on personal observations than documentation. One reviewer of “Money and Class in America,” Richard Eder in the Los Angeles Times, described him as “Tom Wolfe without the legwork.”His books and essays “all amount to pretty much the same contemptuous, Olympian jeremiad: The powers-that-be are craven and monstrous, American culture is vulgar and depraved, the U.S. is like imperial Rome, our democracy is dying or dead. All of which is arguably true,” wrote Kurt Andersen in New York magazine in 2005. “But, jeez, sometime tell me something I didn’t know, show a shred of uncertainty and maybe some struggle to suss out fresh truth.”At age 72, in 2007, and with the financial support of wealthy friends like the chairman of Barnes & Noble, Mr. Lapham launched Lapham’s Quarterly, an erudite print counterpoint to what he considered the hyperactive pace and frivolous emphasis of internet culture.Each issue examined one topic, such as love, war, politics, or the family, through curated excerpts of the writings of great thinkers of the past. His goal was to infuse the wisdom of the likes of Aristotle, Thomas Paine, Simón Bolívar and Vaclav Havel into contemporary debates and to provide a springboard for discovery. (The magazine announced in late 2023 that because of financial challenges, the print publication would be “on a temporary hiatus.”)“Somebody comes across it and … goes from a smaller excerpt in the Quarterly to the whole work by Diderot,” Mr. Lapham told Smithsonian in 2012, referring to the French philosopher and encyclopedist. “The hope of social or political change stems from language that induces a change of heart. That’s the power of words, and that’s a different power than the power of the internet.”"
WaPo_4,The dress that swept Capitol Hill,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/fashion/2024/07/24/tuckernuck-jackie-dress/,2024-07-25 04:17:19.122200,,"Jackie shows up at work events, at baby showers, at cocktail parties, in family portraits, her braided neckline elegantly framing the face.She is in Zoom meetings, she’s on Capitol Hill. And she was all over the Republican National Convention last week.Wait — the late Jackie Kennedy Onassis, icon of the Democratic Party, at the RNC? And on Zoom?Of course we’re not talking about Jackie the person. We’re talking about Jackie the dress.The Jackie is an A-line short-sleeved polyester tweed shift dress by Washington, D.C.-based women’s fashion company Tuckernuck that sells for $268. Named for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the dress comes in the colors of a WASPy crayon box — red, croissant, pearl white, hot pink, palm beach green and 20-some more shades — and its combination of mod-shape and tweed fabric recall the former first lady’s blend of youthful hipness and Chanel-inspired traditional glamour. Four braided faux pockets, studded with gold buttons, sit on the hips. Tuckernuck has also produced sleeveless and long-sleeve versions, the latter of which is slightly pricier.“We go back to who our customer is inspired by,” said September Votta, one of the brand’s three co-founders, in a recent interview. “We always find that Jackie Kennedy continues to remain relevant to them and a source of inspiration. And we think a lot about the meaning of names when we’re designing products. So we wanted to create something that worked on a lot of body types and looked good across multiple colors.”Since Tuckernuck introduced the dress in the summer of 2022, the founders say they have sold nearly 100,000 Jackies. While Votta and Madeline Grayson, another co-founder, said that their biggest markets are in New York and Texas, the dress has become a common sight on the streets of D.C., especially on Capitol Hill. (D.C. is in Tuckernuck’s Top 10 markets.) A Fox News anchor, first ladies and members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historically Black sorority to which Vice President Harris belongs, have all worn the Jackie. Amazon carries a knockoff — or a dupe, in the sunny parlance of deals-driven-ethics-be-damned consumers — for $48.99.“It makes you feel instantly polished and put together,” said Lauren Reddington, a communications specialist who has blogged about the dress on her site, By Lauren Anne, and has the dress in both pink and green. Before a recent move to California, Reddington worked for a number of years on the communications team for Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). “When I worked in the Senate, I was constantly on my feet, running around to different events. And this is a perfect dress [for that]. So it’s really no surprise to me that it’s being so embraced, by D.C. and Capitol Hill.”“I was initially hesitant of the price, but when I thought about it and looked at my workwear wardrobe, it really just fit a gap that was in my work closet,” she said.The Jackie appears especially popular among those who work for Republican politicians. Last week, in Milwaukee, there seemed to be some tacit agreement that the Jackie would be the official dress of the RNC. In most crowds, at least one could be seen. A heather-gray Jackie bopped to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance” at one of the buzzy after-hours warehouse parties. A cream Jackie was in line for a banh mi at the concessions outside the expo hall. A half-dozen red Jackies — so many red Jackies! — dotted the convention floor, camouflaged against its crimson carpet.Not that every braided-neck shift was the real thing. “This is from Amazon,” said a woman in a Kelly green impostor on her way out of the convention one night.“You can always tell,” a lilac Jackie declared about the fakes from her bar stool at the Trade Hotel on Thursday night. As she stood up, it was clear that her dress fit particularly well — offering shape where little seemed given, skimming her knees just so. “You have to get these hemmed and darted,” she said as she walked away.Tuckernuck did not set out to create an “it” dress. Founded in 2012 by Votta, Grayson and Jocelyn Gailliot, who is Grayson’s older sister and also serves as CEO, Tuckernuck began as an e-commerce business that sold the designs of contemporary brands such as Saloni, Sea and Loeffler Randall. “We just had this vision of taking the boutique model and bringing it online, because we have always been very passionate about discovery and telling the story of brands and products that we find through friends,” said Grayson, who met Votta while the two were at the University of Pennsylvania together.They did a round of family-and-friends fundraising in 2015 but were swiftly profitable and operate without outside investors, a rare reality in the fashion business, where even small hipster brands are often funded by venture capital. (Grayson and Votta declined to disclose more specific financial information about the size of their business.) “We’re very careful with our designs and inventory and making sure that we’re listening to the customer and not just creating a bunch of things that don’t sell,” Grayson said.Also unusual is the brand’s D.C. origins: “It’s not a fashion-first city, obviously, but people are very busy and going to lots of events, and they want to look nice,” Grayson said. “So I think we serve that purpose and solve that problem for what a lot of the D.C. women represent. There are a lot of people around the country that aren’t in New York, where they have all this fashion at their fingertips.” They opened a store in Georgetown in 2017.In 2018, Tuckernuck — which is named for a small island off the coast of Nantucket — began its own private label, which has since become a majority of its business.“We felt like there was this void, especially in the beginning, for beautiful, high-quality dresses under $300,” Votta said. The founders said they ordered the Amazon dupe to assess its quality and were disappointed. (“We have nothing to worry about,” Votta recalled thinking.)Other Tuckernuck bestsellers include the Callahan, a $128 swingy shirt dress, and the Chloe, a $298 shirt dress. “We’re always thinking of things you can wear during the day, but also at night, or to work and out to drinks,” Votta said. By not selling their goods through other distributors, Grayson and Votta said, they do not have to mark up their designs the way other brands do. “We’re always obsessed with the quality surpassing an item’s value,” Votta said. “We are in the weeds of the details of what we’re making,” Grayson added.Votta said they expected the Jackie to be a hit but were “blown away by the success” when it sold through almost immediately after they first introduced it. In part, the timing gave it a boost: “It looks great on Zoom,” said Reddington, who works remotely.“We joke that it’s the return-to-work dress,” Votta said. “You can feel really polished and put together, and you don’t have to think about your full look.” Rather than mulling over matching pants and a top or a necklace to elevate the dress, “it’s a one-and-done deal.” Grayson added that its versatility is also key: “It’s really amazing to see the variety of events it’s worn to, and the body types and how it’s styled.”But is there something ironically Republican about this dress with a Democratic origin myth? A staffer for Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) joked on X that GOP staffers’ Prime Day carts would be stocked with a copy of Republican vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” and Amazon’s Jackie dupe.POV: GOP staffers cart for Prime Day pic.twitter.com/cXl2owJpJNAnd although no one in the Trump family has worn the dress, multiple reports have stated that Kennedy Onassis has been a style inspiration for Ivanka Trump and her stepmother, former first lady Melania Trump.“It does not feel political to me,” Reddington said. “The look is classic and timeless. I would say it’s political only in the sense that working in the Capitol itself is [political].” And because the dress references a significant moment in D.C. style, she said, it emphasizes the historic nature of working in politics. “It gives you the sense of all the moments in time that came before you,” Reddington added.An emerald Jackie spotted in Midtown Manhattan in mid-July shrugged in confusion when asked about the dress having partisan associations. “Wait, wasn’t Jackie Kennedy a Democrat?”Kara Voght contributed to this report."
WaPo_5,How political cartoonists drew Biden’s historic exit and Harris’s rise,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2024/07/24/joe-biden-kamala-harris-political-cartoons/,2024-07-25 04:10:19.122200,,"Nothing engages political cartoonists quite like a fresh campaign showdown. With the emergence of Vice President Harris this week as Donald Trump’s potential opponent in the race for the White House, editorial artists on the right and left are gearing up to rise to the national challenge.Since President Biden announced Sunday that he was ending his reelection bid, the spotlight and donor dollars have quickly shifted to Harris. Meanwhile, Trump supporters are adjusting their lines of verbal attack to a new potential foe. All of that “seems to have re-energized this election,” said Dave Whamond of the Cagle Cartoons syndicate. “And, in turn, it has re-energized us cartoonists.”Within 24 hours of the Biden bombshell, many artists homed in on three satiric questions: How should they characterize the president’s exit from the campaign? How should they depict the fresh focus on Harris as his likely replacement? And how should they anticipate and frame the GOP response?Adam Zyglis, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for the Buffalo News, saw Biden’s decision as a noble one of putting country over self, so he drew the president holding the door for Lady Liberty as he says, “After you.”“I chose this concept in part because Joe Biden represents old-fashioned grace and decency, especially in stark contrast to former president Trump’s crass and self-serving rhetoric,” Zyglis said. “The simple act of holding a door open for someone is a metaphor for selflessness.”He rendered Lady Liberty stepping forward to connote “democracy first” and “left her faceless to hint at a strong woman taking the lead from here,” Zyglis said, adding that the caption “plays off the disingenuous language of the right to illustrate what it really means to put the country first. Biden’s move was a great act of patriotism in a political age that often lacks such humility.”Jack Ohman, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist drawing for Smerconish.com, also paid tribute to Biden, who was in Delaware recovering from covid. Ohman depicts Biden being showered with thanks next to the caption, “Out of isolation.” “I was going to draw the president in isolation in a darkened room looking out at a crowd calling for him to leave,” Ohman said. “Then he left, and the emotional outpouring for this man moved me to draw him out of isolation and basking in what he rightfully deserves: applause for a great job.”Al Goodwyn of Creators, by contrast, believed that it was high time for Biden to exit, so he drew a dazed president recognizing the writing on a wall that’s telling him to withdraw. His cartoon about “the drastic change in Biden’s stature was a natural mashup of two elements,” Goodwyn said. “One: Biden finally seeing ‘the writing on the wall.’ The other: his fate as Humpty Dumpty after locking up the Democratic Party’s nomination [and] taking a tumble from that same wall. In reality, he was aided by a heavy nudge.”Nick Anderson, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for the RA News-Tribune, satirized what he views as the forces behind Biden’s announcement; spinning the president’s own words, he drew Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as party power broker strongly urging him out. “I’m certain there were many voices that persuaded Biden to make this decision,” said Anderson, who called this outcome the right move, “but I doubt any loomed as large as Nancy Pelosi’s.”Many artists deployed the visual metaphor of Biden passing the torch to Harris. In the eyes of the Chicago Tribune’s Scott Stantis, though, Biden held the torch too long. From the 2020 campaign, Stantis understood Biden’s position to be, “I’m going to serve one term, [then] the torch is going to be passed,” Stantis recalled, adding: “That’s what should’ve happened.”Some satirists, including Anderson, lampooned how the Trump campaign painted Biden as the older-seeming candidate in this race — and how that dynamic shifts if Trump runs against Harris. “I tweeted a joke saying that now that Biden has exited the race, Trump is too old to be president, especially when comparing him to” Harris, said Lalo Alcaraz, the Herblock Prize-winning cartoonist for Andrews McMeel Syndication. “I saw how viral that went, so I decided to make it into a cartoon.” Alcaraz depicts Trump with hate symbols as criticism of what he views as “Trump’s racist and authoritarian language,” which the artist says is “alarming and a real threat to myself, immigrants and other people of color.”Liza Donnelly and Clay Bennett were among the artists who chose to tout Harris as a promising pick to be the Democratic nominee. “Harris has been and is a powerful advocate for women’s rights, and it is exciting to see her candidacy for president take off with such strong support from the Democratic base,” said Donnelly, who draws for Medium, adding: “It is a different world than when Hillary Clinton ran for president, and I believe that our country is ready for a woman president.” (Donnelly is working on a film about female cartoonists.)Bennett, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press, drew Harris as a boost of electric energy to a party that had been running low and “wallowing in pessimism for weeks.” Seeing how quickly Harris “had energized the Democratic Party’s confidence, it wasn’t much of a leap to compare her to the charger I look for every time my phone is low on power,” Bennett said. “Hopefully the Democratic Party can hold a charge longer than my cellphone is able to.”Ann Telnaes, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for The Washington Post, drew why she sees a choice between Harris and Trump as a no-brainer. The rise of Harris also has Telnaes reflecting on three decades of media coverage of Clinton: “It wasn’t just the Republicans who attacked her. The news media was also guilty of using sexist narratives and labels they would never use with a male politician. I’m not talking about legitimate criticism of policies, but the personal attacks just because she is a woman.”“The Trump campaign has already started this tactic,” Telnaes added. “We’ll see if the news media will follow suit or stick to the facts of each candidate.”In a similar vein, Pedro X. Molina of Counterpoint Media depicted a crazed GOP elephant in a MAGA cap pivoting from ageism to racism and chauvinism among its file of “hate tactics.” Biden’s decision to withdraw is causing nervousness and “discontent on the MAGA side, which will now have to recalibrate its ‘strategy’ of disqualification against its new opponent,” Molina said.In a visual nod to the comic strip “Bloom County” and its bedroom closet of anxieties, Whamond drew Trump facing the prospect of Harris. “My immediate thought was this is Trump’s worst nightmare: having to face off against a strong, powerful woman of color. A prosecutor  versus  a felon,” Whamond said. “Now Trump is the tired, old candidate, and Harris is the young, vibrant new kid in town.”And Darrin Bell, the Pulitzer-winning cartoonist for King Features Syndicate, drew a Harris foe using artificial intelligence prompts to find racist and misogynistic insults.“Benjamin Banneker. Frederick Douglass. Thurgood Marshall. The civil rights movement. Stacey Abrams. Letitia James. Alvin Bragg. And now, potentially, Kamala Harris. Black Americans have always been instrumental in helping to course-correct this country when it’s strayed away from its founding principles,” Bell said. “And that really ticks off those who want the country to stray from its founding principles. It was obvious that racist and sexist attacks against Harris would accelerate as soon as Biden withdrew.“The transition to Kamala Harris is exciting, especially to younger voters,” Bell continued. “After Biden’s historically awful debate, it’s an enormous relief.”Michael Cavna is a former Post staff writer and the creator of its “Comic Riffs” column."
WaPo_6,Lawmaker alleges stonewalling at DHS on Secret Service report,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/24/homeland-security-january-6-attack/,2024-07-25 04:41:19.122200,,"A congressional subcommittee chairman on Wednesday accused the Department of Homeland Security of stalling publication of a report on the Secret Service’s handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former president Donald Trump.In a letter to the DHS, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) accused Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of delaying the release of an inspector general report that might have been critical of the department while providing insight into any Secret Service deficiencies before the assassination attempt against Trump this month at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa.“There is absolutely no justification for your delay,” Loudermilk, chairman of the House Administration subcommittee on oversight, which has jurisdiction over Capitol security, wrote to Mayorkas.“This failure to provide an in-depth review of the department’s security planning and operational failures related to January 6 not only raises concerns about the department’s botched planning for former president Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024, but it is quite possible that such reports could have prevented the security breakdown that resulted in the near assassination of a former president and presidential candidate,” Loudermilk wrote.Loudermilk said Homeland Security had delayed two DHS inspector general reports into the Jan. 6 attack: a report examining the Secret Service’s actions during that event — which he said is complete and ready for publication — and a second report about the department’s overall law enforcement response.He asked Mayorkas to commit to releasing both reports within five business days.DHS officials denied delaying or withholding information from the inspector general and said that office, not the department, determines when reports are released.“We continue to cooperate with all OIG requests,” DHS spokeswoman Naree Ketudat said in a statement.Loudermilk’s letter came a day after Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned following intense criticism of security failures at the rally for Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the November election. A gunman gained access to an unprotected roof and shot at Trump, wounding the former president, killing a rallygoer and seriously injuring two others.Multiple agencies are investigating the rally shooting, including the DHS Office of Inspector General, led by Trump appointee Joseph V. Cuffari.Cuffari’s investigation of the Capitol attack by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results has been ongoing for years and has been the subject of much controversy. Cuffari stunned Congress in July 2022 with a letter alleging the Secret Service had erased many of its text messages from the time around Jan. 6, deleting potential evidence.After Cuffari sent the letter, lawmakers questioned why he had waited to notify them about the deleted messages. His office also halted its own investigators’ efforts to recover the messages, which the Secret Service said were erased as part of a planned device replacement program.Cuffari is also under investigation by an independent panel for alleged misconduct, including his handling of the missing texts, partisan decision-making and whistleblower retaliation. Cuffari and others sued unsuccessfully to block that investigation.Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, who chaired the House select committee that investigated Jan. 6, and Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md.) called for Cuffari to resign last year, after Cuffari admitted to deleting text messages from his government-issued iPhone in possible violation of federal records laws.In his letter Wednesday, Loudermilk alleged that it was the DHS that mishandled its responses to the inspector general’s investigations.He alleged the DHS “has repeatedly obstructed, delayed, or denied the ability” of the Office of Inspector General to conduct effective oversight, as mandated by the Inspector General Act of 1978. The office is an independent government entity charged with rooting out corruption and mismanagement.“This Subcommittee is equally concerned that this obstruction is a pattern of behavior to delay or prevent the release of certain reports that could be damaging to the Department,” Loudermilk wrote.Loudermilk alleged that the department had required Cuffari’s office to heavily redact a March 2022 report on DHS intelligence leading up to the Jan. 6 attack — which focused on the agency’s actions under the Trump administration.This February, nearly two years after that report was published, the subcommittee asked the inspector general’s office to share unredacted copies of its findings.Loudermilk said the inspector general’s office said it could not share that information without Homeland Security’s permission, because the DHS had threatened to revoke its access to data if the office released a report without the department’s permission. DHS officials denied threatening to revoke access to the inspector general.Loudermilk wrote that he later examined the unredacted report and found that many of the redactions were unnecessary and “merely an attempt to shield DHS from scrutiny regarding the failures in intelligence gathering and reporting before and after January 6, 2021.”In a July 19 message to Congress, Cuffari wrote that the department had subjected his office to “delays and denials” that, in seven recent instances, hindered his access to information.Loudermilk also faced scrutiny after the Jan. 6 attack.The select House committee that investigated the attack alleged that Loudermilk gave a “reconnaissance” tour of the Capitol complex to a group of people on Jan. 5, 2021, the day before the attack. The committee did not provide direct evidence, and Loudermilk denied wrongdoing. U.S. Capitol Police also cleared Loudermilk of wrongdoing, writing in a letter that there was “no evidence that Representative Loudermilk entered the U.S. Capitol with this group on January 5, 2021.”Loudermilk this year launched a subcommittee investigation into the alleged politicization of the Jan. 6. select committee."
WaPo_7,U.K. royals to get big raise as Crown Estate sees record $1.4 billion profit,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/24/royal-family-crown-estate-profits/,2024-07-25 04:06:19.122200,,"LONDON — The British royal family will be receiving a 53 percent raise, worth more than 45 million pounds ($58 million), thanks to a record increase in its estate’s annual profit, propelled in part by offshore wind farm leases on seabed plots owned by the monarchy.The Crown Estate, the organization that manages the sprawling royal land and property portfolio, released a report Wednesday for the 2023-2024 financial year, the first to cover a full financial year with King Charles III on the throne.It showed that the Crown Estate generated a “record net revenue profit” of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) — 658.1 million pounds more than last year — and revealed the royal family’s plans for future purchases with its share of that money, including two new helicopters.The Crown Estate is formally owned by the royal family but is controlled by the British government. Profits that the estate generates each year go to the state treasury, and the government returns a percentage to the royals under what is known as the “Sovereign Grant” to cover the operating costs of the royal household — including staff salaries, entertainment, property maintenance and travel.“A year of record results driven by decades of investment in offshore wind, combined with a diverse and resilient property and land portfolio, shows how The Crown Estate continues to deliver economic, social, and environmental value for the benefit of the nation,” the estate said in a news release.The Sovereign Grant is based on funds two years in arrears, meaning the royal family won’t be getting an increase until the 2025-2026 financial year.In recent years, the royal family has received 86.3 million pounds ($111.4 million) from the government, and will again in 2024-2025. That figure will rise to 132 million pounds ($170 million) for 2025-2026.The grant will support ongoing 10-year renovation projects at Buckingham Palace, British media reported, citing royal officials.The program, whose total cost will be 369 million pounds ($476 million), is “making progress” according to a report published Monday by Britain’s National Audit Office, a public spending watchdog.The report noted that while the program is “within budget,” some projects “have increased in cost and taken longer to complete than expected.”The Crown Estate places the total value of its portfolio at 15.5 billion pounds ($20 billion). The land that the royal family owns or profits from totals nearly 500,000 acres, The Washington Post reported last year — more than 1 percent of the land in the United Kingdom.The royals’ holdings include lucrative properties in London and much of the seabed surrounding the British Isles, which is being used for offshore wind leasing.Early last year, the Crown Estate announced the signing of six new wind farm deals that it said would generate power for an estimated 7 million homes by 2030. That same day, Charles said the public should benefit from wind farm profits — not the royals.Because of the high-income forecast of the offshore wind farms, the funding of the monarchy was reduced last year to 12 percent of the Crown Estate’s net profits, instead of 25 percent, the BBC reported. Dan Labbad, the chief executive of the Crown Estate, said in the report this week that the profit boost reflected was “short term in nature,” and that “revenue and valuation will normalize” in the years to come.Following the report’s release, which was delayed by a month because of Britain’s general election, some took to social media to express skepticism of royal wealth — which grew last year during the coronation amid a cost-of-living crisis.“No cost of living squeeze for indulged King Charles,” tweeted Kevin Maguire, associate editor of Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper. Maguire added that the monarch “avoided inheritance tax on mummy’s ££££££££s estate.”Critics of the royal family have long pointed out that while Britons pay a 40 percent inheritance tax, Charles paid zero on the estate when he inherited it upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II.The accounts revealed that the royal family will receive two new helicopters to replace their existing 15-year-old helicopters. The document said “the use of helicopters is a key component of delivering engagements” by royal family members, helping them to reach remote locations.As well as offshore wind, the royals are seeking to invest in other renewable technologies, according to the report, which said more renewable energy solutions will be installed across the royal portfolio.It has been a turbulent period for the royal family, with both the king and his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, stepping back from public-facing duties as each was diagnosed with cancer.After Charles was diagnosed in February, Catherine revealed in March that she too had cancer and was in the early stages of preventive chemotherapy.Despite his diagnosis, the king undertook 464 official engagements in the 12 months ending March 31, according to the report.In Britain and overseas, the royals carried out more than 2,300 official engagements, 400 fewer than the year before.A separate income report published by the royal household Wednesday noted an increase in visitors to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle “back to almost pre-covid levels.” That helped boost funds to supplement the Sovereign Grant to 19.8 million pounds ($25.5 million) during the 2023-2024 financial year — up from 9.8 million pounds ($12.6 million) the year before.Karla Adam and Adam Taylor contributed to this report"
WaPo_8,"Democrats approve plan to pick their nominee, probably Kamala Harris",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/democratic-delegate-nominee-voting/,2024-07-25 04:06:19.122200,,"The Democratic National Convention’s rules committee approved the process Wednesday for selecting their presidential nominee via a virtual roll call vote, to begin early next month.Vice President Harris, who has amassed more than enough pledged support from delegates to win, is likely to be declared the official nominee by Aug. 7.As of now, no serious candidate has emerged to challenge Harris for the nomination. If she remains the only person running, electronic voting will begin Aug. 1. If other candidates emerge, the voting may start a bit later to give them time to campaign for delegate votes, according to Democratic National Convention rules.Any Democrat who wants to seek the presidential nomination has until Tuesday at 6 p.m. to formally declare their candidacy and obtain signatures of support from 300 delegates. At least 3,180 of the nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates have endorsed Harris, according to a survey by the Associated Press.Political parties traditionally nominate the presidential ticket at their conventions, but Democrats decided this year to hold a virtual roll call weeks earlier than their Aug. 19 Chicago convention to ensure they meet ballot access deadlines. The issue arose due to an Aug. 7 Ohio deadline that could have kept the Democratic ticket off that state’s ballot.The GOP-led Ohio legislature passed a law extending the deadline, but Democrats have insisted that they don’t trust Republicans in that state to adhere to it. Democrat have also pointed to late-August ballot deadlines in other states to suggest that the timeline is too tight for them to wait until the convention to nominate the party ticket.State election officials in several states have said there are processes in place to help parties who might miss deadlines to ensure they get their candidates on the ballot. Election law experts say any legal efforts to challenge this would probably be dismissed by the courts because there is a deference to parties’ rights to have their nominees appear on the ballot.Still, Pat Moore, a lawyer for the Democratic Party, insisted during a virtual meeting of the convention’s rules committee that they expected Republicans to be litigious about ballot deadlines, “arguing that our nominees should never have been on the ballot in the first place.”A rules committee member asked during debate why the Democrats hadn’t considered the ballot access deadlines when they planned a late-August convention.“Unfortunately, 2020 demonstrated that as far as election litigation is concerned, we are in a new world,” Moore said. “Will we face litigation no matter what? I think that’s safe to say … but accepting that we will face that litigation does not mean that we are powerless to strengthen our position.”The new rules also note that there will still be a state-by-state roll call for the Democratic ticket at the Chicago convention but described those votes as “celebratory and ceremonial.”"
WaPo_9,Man who lost flip flops in Death Valley hospitalized for burned feet,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/24/man-who-lost-flip-flops-death-valley-hospitalized-burned-feet/,2024-07-25 04:05:19.122200,,"A Belgian man who was visiting Death Valley National Park was rescued via helicopter on Saturday after suffering third-degree burns on the soles of his feet at the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes.According to the National Park Service, it was unclear if the unidentified 42-year-old had lost or broken the flip-flops he wore to the park, known to be one of the hottest places on Earth, on a day when the air temperature reached 123 degrees Fahrenheit.After the man’s family and other guests to the park carried him to the parking lot, rangers determined it would be best to get him to the hospital quickly due to the pain and severity of his injuries. Because of the extreme weather, the emergency helicopter wasn’t able to land at that part of the park, so rangers had to drive him in an ambulance to a higher elevation zone where it was cooler (109 degrees). He was airlifted from there to a Las Vegas hospital.On a sand dune, the ground temperature is much hotter than in the air. That’s because sand doesn’t require much energy to warm up. When the sand’s high density traps that heat, the result is a hot, hot surface. When it’s 90 degrees outside, for example, sand temperatures can reach approximately 120. That’s enough to cause second- or third-degree burns “in minutes,” according to RWJBarnabas Health, an academic health care system in New Jersey.Third-degree burns on the feet “could be devastating, they could be terrible,” said Priya Parthasarathy, a Silver Spring-based podiatrist. That’s especially true for children or people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or neuropathy, she said.Parthasarathy, a physician spokesperson for the American Podiatric Medical Association, said travelers should invest in the proper footwear for their activity, whether that’s hiking shoes or even water shoes.Parthasarathy said she will see patients who come in because of a painful spot on the bottom of their feet without realizing they suffered a burn. She asks if they’ve been at the beach, walking on pavement or barefoot at the pool.“Especially with these really hot temperatures lately I’ve been seeing more burns,” she said.She said people should test the surface temperature on the ground before walking barefoot or letting children take their shoes off. If someone does suffer a burn to their foot, she said to run the area under cold water right away or apply a cold compress. Avoid popping any blisters and make an appointment to see a podiatrist, she said.Parthasarathy said many flip-flops are thin and flimsy, providing little protection. Sport sandals that have more support and stay secured to feet are a better choice, but travelers would need to remember to use sunscreen for uncovered skin. For very hot destinations, more coverage is better, Parthasarathy said.“As a blanket statement, it is probably better to have your feet covered just to prevent against heat injuries, sunburns, sharp objects,” she said.Travel advice blogs and online forums recommend travelers wear closed-toe hiking boots rather than sandals to the park, precisely due to heat and rough gravel on hiking trails.Death Valley park rangers also recommend summer travelers stay no more than a 10-minute walk from their air-conditioned car, consume water and salty snacks, wear a hat and sunscreen, and not hike after 10 a.m.This isn’t the first time someone in Death Valley suffered third-degree burns due to a lack of footwear. In June 2017, a woman also in the Mesquite Sand Dunes burned the soles of her feet after walking half a mile barefoot. She had to be treated at a nearby hospital.Last week, four people died of heat-related injuries in U.S. national and state parks."
WaPo_10,Could Republicans get buyer’s remorse with J.D. Vance?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/could-republicans-get-buyers-remorse-with-jd-vance/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"Nine days ago, Donald Trump picked a running mate in Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) that projected confidence about the race ahead. Trump seemed to be choosing a desire to guide his party in a more MAGA direction over expanding his base to improve his chances in the 2024 election.The flip side of that, as I noted at the time, was risk. Vance didn’t pack the same base-expanding potential as other candidates (such as Sen. Tim Scott, Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum). And Vance’s only campaign — for Senate in 2022 — was nothing to write home about. Despite winning, he polled as unpopular and performed significantly worse than any other statewide Ohio GOP candidate.A week after Vance’s big introduction at the Republican National Convention, that risk looms large.At least five quality polls out this week have gauged Vance’s image, and each shows that more people dislike him than like him. They show he is between two and nine points underwater.As CNN’s Harry Enten noted Tuesday, that appears to be without recent precedent. Vice-presidential picks usually get a honeymoon period, and none has been in such negative territory so soon after their debut on the biggest stage.But how much does that mean at this early juncture?Let’s first dive into the numbers, from the CNN, NPR-PBS-Marist College, Reuters-Ipsos, Quinnipiac University and Economist-YouGov polls:We are, of course, in unusual times. Vance’s introduction was overshadowed by the assassination attempt on Trump just two days before. It has also come amid plenty of focus on the Democratic side — and particularly whether President Biden would end his campaign, as he ultimately did Sunday. Perhaps Vance didn’t really have the chance to win people’s attention (and approval).He also enters the stage at a time when voters are particularly sour on national politics. It’s rare to see any politician be popular; Trump, Biden and Vice President Harris are all also viewed more negatively than positively.But generally speaking, VP picks are different — and more popular than the people who pick them. Hillary Clinton was double digits underwater for most of the 2016 campaign, but Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) was pretty popular soon after Clinton selected him as her running mate. Biden had middling numbers in 2020, but Harris’s unpopularity from her 2020 presidential primary campaign soon reversed.And Trump’s previous running mate, Mike Pence, was generally popular despite Trump’s being as much as 20 or 30 points underwater down the home stretch of the 2020 campaign.It did take some time for Pence and Harris to improve their images — it didn’t happen immediately after the conventions — but voters were at least initially evenly split on them.And, notably, Vance’s numbers are also worse than those for most of the big names being floated as potential running mates for Harris. Both Reuters-Ipsos and Economist-YouGov also tested such names as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Sen. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. In each case, about as many Americans liked them as disliked them.So it’s evident that Vance has some work to do and that his introduction hasn’t exactly gone swimmingly.That doesn’t mean this is a major liability for Trump; Vance isn’t so unpopular that he would seem to be a reason for Trump-inclined voters to abandon Trump. The top of the ticket is what matters to the vast majority of voters, even as Trump’s running mate could matter somewhat more, given that Trump is 78.But it does point to what may be a missed opportunity — the opportunity to put forward a running mate who appeals to voters who might be skeptical of Trump or gives them something Trump doesn’t.That mattered less under the previous setup, when Trump appeared to be a pretty strong favorite to defeat Biden. If Harris can make the race more competitive and Vance’s numbers don’t improve — both big ifs — you can bet that more than a few people will begin to question the wisdom of a decision that seemed dicey even at the time."
WaPo_11,"Maggots, crickets released at Watergate Hotel in protest of Netanyahu visit",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/24/watergate-hotel-protest-maggots-netanyahu-visit/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"An Instagram video posted Wednesday shows hundreds of mealworms, maggots and crickets crawling around the Watergate Hotel where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is staying during his visit to D.C., raising questions about how protesters who claimed to unleash the vermin were able to get onto the property as the area has been under tight security.The video, posted jointly to Instagram by the Palestinian Youth Movement and its DMV chapter, depicts swarms of crickets on the hotel’s floor and claims protesters triggered the hotel’s fire alarm “to ensure that there will be no rest before Netanyahu and Congress disgraces themselves in front of the world” when the Israeli leader addressed Congress in a joint meeting Wednesday. The video also shows maggots and mealworms crawling across a table set with drinking glasses as Israeli and American flags stand side by side in the background.An official familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters said the video appeared to be authentic.Residents of the Watergate complex said U.S. Secret Service and D.C. police set up checkpoints over the weekend to vet anyone entering the property.“The Watergate facility has an expansive footprint and remains open for businesses, residences and guests,” said Abel Trevino, a spokesperson for a public safety team made up of local and federal agencies staffing Netanyahu’s visit to the District. “At no time was there any threat to our protectees.”The hotel, whose answering machine ironically greets callers with “There’s no need to break in” as a nod to its storied history, said in a statement it was aware of the video and “the unfortunate incident that occurred at the property yesterday.”“Our top priority is the safety and well-being of our guests and staff,” the statement from a hotel spokesperson said. “We took the necessary steps to ensure the property has been sanitized and is now operating as normal. We are cooperating fully with authorities, who are handling the situation. As this is an open case, we are unable to provide any further details at this time.”A D.C. Fire and EMS spokesperson said in a statement that the agency had fire inspectors stationed at Netanyahu’s hotel “at the request of the United States Secret Service,” and that after the alarm sounded, fire officials “determined there was no fire emergency and any fire department response was cancelled.”Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Zaid Khatib, 27, an organizer with the DMV chapter of the Palestinian Youth Movement said an anonymous tipster sent the video to his group, which in turn posted it Wednesday morning.Khatib said he was not involved in this protest and did not know who was responsible, but he said protesters have also held noise demonstrations outside the hotel every morning and night to make sure Netanyahu “will enjoy no rest while he is here.”The releasing of maggots, he said, reflects “the fact that all of D.C. from organizations to individuals reject the stay of a war criminal in our city.”Khatib said he does not know if there are more protests planned for inside the Watergate Hotel.“It reflects a tremendous security failure on their part,” he said, referring to law enforcement. “The city of D.C. and the United States government has stolen tens of millions of dollars to roll out the red carpet for a war criminal and even then, they can’t stop something as simple as maggots being dropped … at the Watergate Hotel.”"
WaPo_12,"Netanyahu dismisses critics, scolds protesters in defiant speech to Congress",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/24/benjamin-netanyahu-speech-congress-israel-gaza/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"A defiant Benjamin Netanyahu, in an address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, dismissed as “utter nonsense” criticisms by the United Nations, human rights groups and others that his government has committed war crimes in Gaza and derided protesters as “idiots” and tools of Iran.The embattled Israeli prime minister told U.S. lawmakers that Israel will settle for “nothing less” than total victory over Hamas, and described a vision for a postwar Gaza seemingly at odds with the terms of a peace deal being pursued by the Biden administration. The fate of Israel and the United States are inextricably linked, he claimed, making the case that U.S. investments in Israel’s war aims also serve to defend the United States and “all democracies.”“We help keep Americans’ boots off the ground,” Netanyahu thundered, claiming that “Israel fights on the front line of civilization.” He praised the United States’ extensive annual military assistance, but implored Congress to deliver more. “Give us the tools faster, and we’ll finish the job faster,” he said.“This is not a clash of civilizations. It’s a clash between barbarism and civilization. It’s a clash between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life,” Netanyahu said to cheers and applause in the House chamber, as outside the Capitol throngs of police deployed pepper spray to keep protesters at a distance.Netanyahu’s address, spanning about an hour, comes as his far-right government nears the start of its tenth month of war in Gaza, where local authorities say 39,000 Palestinians have been killed amid daily bombardment and famine, and as a majority of Israelis say they want him to leave office.He arrived on Capitol Hill in a bulletproof motorcade, passing through a phalanx of security as protesters marched through downtown Washington, condemning the Israeli leader as an accused war criminal and calling on the Biden administration to end its weapons shipments to Netanyahu’s government.In his remarks, Netanyahu accused pro-Palestinian demonstrators of standing with the Hamas militants who staged October’s savage attack on Israel, triggering the Gaza war.“You should be ashamed of yourself,” he bellowed, alleging that Iran, Israel’s sworn enemy in the Middle East, is funding such protests throughout the United States and chiding their participants “useful idiots” and antisemites.Although more than 50 lawmakers said they were boycotting the speech, there were only a few empty seats in the House chamber. Some had been filled by guests, including a group of Israeli soldiers highlighted by Netanyahu in his speech. One, who responded heroically during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 “killed many terrorists, and saved many lives,” he said.“I am past pissed off. I am past upset. I am absolutely ashamed of what is happening,” Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) told reporters on a conference call alongside other Democrats and former government officials who resigned from their jobs in protest of the administration’s Israel policy. “Our government has been actively complicit in genocide every step of the way,” Bush added.Many of the Democrats who did attend did so with resignation. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) was one, saying earlier this week that he had chosen to show up out of respect for Israel but that he considers Netanyahu to be “the worst leader in Jewish history.”More than anything, however, Netanyahu’s fourth speech before a joint session of Congress — a privilege afforded to few foreign leaders, and to Netanyahu more than any other in U.S. history — underscored Israel’s staying power as a fixture of American foreign policy and as the largest recipient of U.S. military aid. If Democrats have wavered in their support, Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), have welcomed Netanyahu with open arms, praising his leadership since Hamas launched its cross-border attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw upward of 250 taken hostage.The Biden administration and many congressional Democrats, who have grown increasingly vocal in their displeasure with Netanyahu’s conduct of the war, have nevertheless shied away from inflicting consequences on a key U.S. ally, leaving unimpeded the flow of billions of dollars in weapons, intelligence, and diplomatic commitments central to the two nations’ security relationship.The administration has also been at pains in recent weeks to stress the fervent, months-long efforts by senior officials to negotiate a lasting cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that would see the return of the remaining hostages and pave the way toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. Officials have claimed repeatedly that a deal is within reach, with a State Department spokesman, Matt Miller, telling reporters earlier Wednesday that Washington is working “to bridge the final differences.”But behind closed doors, officials and even some former Israeli officials, have acknowledged that Netanyahu and his cabinet have shown little interest in ending the war. Families of Israeli and American hostages in Gaza also have increasingly criticized Netanyahu for failing to deliver their loved ones from captivity.“This administration has been pretty clear with us consistently where they thought the pressure needed to be,” Jon Polin, the father of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, told The Washington Post in an interview. “They have told us when they thought it needed to be Hamas — and right now their belief is it’s more in Israel’s court.”Netanyahu’s former Army chief of staff-turned-opposition leader, Benny Gantz, also on Wednesday accused Netanyahu of intentionally delaying a cease-fire deal by months, and leaving more Israeli hostages to die.Netanyahu told his audience Wednesday that his government was engaged in efforts to bring home the hostages, and that when he spoke to the hostages’ families earlier this week he “promised them this: I will not rest until all their loved ones are home.”As Netanyahu spoke to American lawmakers, doctors in the Gaza Strip said the ongoing carnage from Israeli bombardment and severe shortages in critical medical supplies had rendered them unable to save those they might have been able to under normal circumstances.Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Monday, when Israeli forces launched a fresh operation in the city of Khan Younis, targeting Hamas militants whom it accused of launching rockets from the area. Doctors in the largest remaining hospital in southern Gaza have said in recent days that their wards have been deluged with civilian casualties, leaving blood banks near dry and an emergency room filled with children.“I pulled a curtain back and there was just a small girl alone, dying,” Javid Abdelmoneim, a medical team leader with Doctors Without Borders, told The Post this week by phone from Gaza. “In a system where there were staff and supplies, and she was the one trauma case, we could have saved her,” he added. But they couldn’t. “She looked like she was eight.”Although Vice President Harris, who has replaced President Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket, declined to preside over the address, an aide emphasized her “unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.” Both she and Biden will meet with Netanyahu on Thursday instead.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Netanyahu would travel to meet with him at his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, their first meeting since Trump expressed his fury toward the Israeli leader for recognizing Biden’s electoral victory in 2020.Republicans have sought to capitalize on deepening liberal opposition to the U.S.-Israel relationship, particularly on college campuses, and have framed Democratic criticisms as nothing short of anti-Semitic betrayal in Israel’s hour of need. The GOP, Republican leaders have argued, is Israel’s only true ally.“This is a moment for moral clarity, and it is unconscionable to us that the president of the United States and some of the leaders in the Senate are unable or unwilling to stand and say what is good and what is evil,” Johnson said last week.Netanyahu also is no stranger to flame-throwing in U.S. politics. He used his last address to Congress, in 2015, to blast the Obama administration’s efforts toward an Iran nuclear deal, infuriating the White House.While he sought to tread a more bipartisan line on Wednesday, praising the Capitol as a “citadel of democracy,” and avoiding partisan distinctions, he has made little effort in recent years to disguise his preference for the GOP, which has abstained from questioning Israel’s human rights record and its treatment of the Palestinians.Steve Hendrix in Tel Aviv, Louisa Loveluck in Jerusalem, Marianna Sotomayor, Mariana Alfaro and Ellie Silverman contributed to this report."
WaPo_13,North Korean balloon drops trash on South Korean presidential office,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/24/korea-trash-balloon-presidential-office/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"For the past few months, North Korea has been pestering its southern neighbor with seemingly sporadic swarms of balloons ferrying trash. The garbage has fallen on South Korean roads, buildings and cars — more of a nuisance than a major security threat incoming from a nuclear-armed rival.But on Wednesday, the rhetorical rubbish landed on the presidential compound in Seoul, delivering what was perhaps the most humiliating of the unwanted loads from the North so far and raising security concerns and questions about whether the situation would devolve.The trash that landed on the presidential office in central Seoul descended from a flock of hundreds of balloons sent from the North on Wednesday, South Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency reported, citing the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. The garbage was discovered on the grounds of the compound by the Presidential Security Service.The Joint Chiefs of Staff said as many as 300 balloons were detected by 4 p.m. local time. Wednesday’s tally was “expected to rise as additional balloons are floating in midair,” Yonhap reported.Wednesday’s dump was the 10th such delivery since the balloon launches began at the end of May, according to data assembled by the Beyond Parallel project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. Among the items deposited across South Korea, according to the project: animal and human feces, batteries, cigarette butts, toilet paper, and clothes.The garbage on Wednesday landed mostly around Seoul, the data showed, the capital city home to more than 9.6 million people about 35 miles south of the border — though earlier waves have reached as far south as Jeonbuk, a province in South Korea’s southwest. The balloons appear to be rudimentary, unable to be steered or directed toward a specific location, making the hit on the presidential compound more a stroke of luck for Pyongyang than a targeted attack.Still, the garbage falling on the presidential office was a “significant PR embarrassment for the South Korean government because it shows how vulnerable they are to ‘soft terrorism,’ which could escalate,” said Victor Cha, Korea chair at CSIS.“Imagine if the balloons were filled with unidentified white powder rather than trash?” he wrote in an email to The Washington Post. Kim Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, was assassinated with the nerve agent VX at an airport in Malaysia in 2017, police there said at the time.Seoul has retaliated by blasting propaganda broadcasts toward the North. South Korean activists have taken it upon themselves to send balloons of their own ferrying anti-North Korea fliers and USB drives containing K-pop and K-dramas. Sending leaflets to the North was briefly outlawed in the South before the law was struck down last year.The resumption of the broadcasts comes after Seoul stopped the audio warfare in 2015, when an angered North began a military buildup along the border.North Korea and South Korea are still technically at war with each other, having never signed a peace treaty to end last century’s Korean War, though the weaponry being lobbed across the demilitarized zone is now garbage and K-pop. (Insurers in the South have begun covering damage inflicted to cars by the balloons despite cutouts in policies exempting acts of war, the Korea Times reported.)South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has taken a more assertive stance against Pyongyang, dashing some activists’ hopes of reunification, as South Korea aligns itself more closely with Japan and the United States to manage risks in the region such as a more zealous Beijing.Cha, of CSIS, said the government in Seoul has “not looked for a conciliatory solution but has ramped up the escalation” with its broadcasts across the border.Ultimately, however, the tit-for-tat reflects most poorly on Pyongyang, displaying its “vulnerability and insecurity,” Cha said. North Korea’s leaders are “more afraid of BTS than US-South Korean military exercises or U.S. nuclear weapons,” he said."
WaPo_14,J.D. Vance said Kamala Harris has no kids. Stepparents would like a word.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2024/07/24/kamala-harris-childless/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"When Ella Emhoff graduated from college in 2021, Vice President Harris posed smiling beside her stepdaughter. At Cole Emhoff’s wedding in October, Harris officiated her stepson’s ceremony. The Emhoff siblings have affectionately dubbed Harris “Momala,” a name she has said she wears proudly.But Harris’s parental role was altogether erased in recent and resurfaced attacks from her political opponents. In a video drawn from a 2021 interview on Fox News’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” J.D. Vance, now the GOP vice-presidential nominee, said that Harris and other prominent Democrats (including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) “don’t really have a direct stake” in the country’s future because they are “people without children.” In the clip, which has amassed more than 25 million views since it was shared Monday on X, Vance also refers to Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made.”Others on the right have echoed Vance’s argument: Will Chamberlain, a conservative commentator and former Ron DeSantis staffer, posted on X on Sunday that a “really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn’t be President” is that she has “no children.”Among the torrent of outraged replies online, many offered corrections to these claims: In 2022, Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, celebrated the birth of their twins. Past presidents have been child-free (including James K. Polk and James Buchanan). George Washington did not have biological offspring; he was a stepparent who helped raise his wife’s children from a previous marriage.And Harris’s relationships with the son and daughter whom she helped raise with her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, absolutely deserve respect and recognition, says Jann Blackstone, a co-parenting mediator, author and founder of the nonprofit Bonus Families, which supports divorced or separated parents and their combined families.Blackstone, who has two stepchildren — she prefers the term “bonus children” — knows firsthand the lingering stereotypes and misconceptions that have long plagued stepparents, and stepmothers in particular: “That they’re not the real mom. That they don’t count. That they’re second-best,” Blackstone says. Over the decades that Blackstone has worked with blended families, she says, she has seen the toll that these messages can take on devoted caregivers.But she has also seen more and more people accept and embrace the idea of blended families — which made Vance’s comments feel especially jarring, she says. “To say something like this seems so backwards to me. It’s just not our reality,” she says. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 16 percent of American children are living in “blended families” — a household with a stepparent, stepsibling or half sibling — and 8 percent of children are living with a stepparent.Blackstone adds that her reaction has nothing to do with Vance’s or Harris’s politics: “I don’t make judgments on people’s political decisions, as far as who I’m going to vote for, or who they’re going to vote for,” she says. “But the family system is changing, and to make a comment like that … it’s just not helpful to society. We don’t need people to say, like, ‘You aren’t qualified to be president because you don’t have children.’ I want bonus parents to be respected as a parental figure.”For Rebecca Brodey, the vice president’s highly visible relationship with Ella and Cole has felt significant for years. “I feel so much solidarity with other stepmoms,” says Brodey, a mother of three, including two stepchildren, in D.C. “So I also feel solidarity with Kamala Harris. When ‘Momala’ was first put in the news, I jokingly said to my stepkids, ‘Why don’t you call me MaBecca?’ and now as a joke my stepdaughter has me in her phone as MaBecca.”Brodey is close with her two stepchildren, she says, both of whom are teens. But she has also sometimes struggled with a role that is frequently overlooked or confronted with skepticism.“My experience as a stepmom is that, at the outset, I’m normally met with distrust,” she says. “It’s just part of the role that you have to prove yourself, you have to demonstrate that you are there to support the kids, that you respect the ex, that you’re a loving person.”So when she considers the recent condemnation of Harris, “I just roll my eyes,” she says. “It’s not surprising to me that they’re going to invalidate her role as a caretaker and as someone who is invested in the future of her stepchildren.”It didn’t surprise Matthew Brake either. The stepfather of three says he’s noticed anti-stepparent sentiments growing in recent years, primarily in certain right-leaning corners of the internet.The clip from Vance’s interview reminded Brake of a social media post he saw circulating a couple of years ago, around the time he was planning to ask his wife to marry him. The post was shared by a self-identified religious, conservative account, he says. “It was typical of other things I was seeing too — this guy didn’t understand how a single guy who did not have his own kids would choose to marry a woman who had her own kids already, and then choose to raise another man’s children,” Brake says. “There was this sort of ugly macho-ism, which, coming from a Christian background, was so antithetical to all the messages I always heard about how God adopts people into his family, about how we should adopt and love the orphan and those who don’t have parents.”Brake has a strong relationship with his own stepfather, he says, and he approaches his stepchildren with the same depth of care and respect. When he married his wife, he says, his wedding vows included a promise to love her children as his own.“You’re still concerned about their future. And if you think that someone having stepkids keeps them from caring about the future — that probably says more about you than it does about a stepparent,” he says. “It’s a politically gross thing to say. It’s disrespectful to every stepparent, to every parent who has adopted kids, to the people who can’t have children but nonetheless mentor and teach and take care of children — it’s disrespectful to all of those people.”To Tomika Anderson Greene, who lives in Virginia with a blended family that includes her biological son and four stepchildren, the idea of dismissing a stepparent is ironic because their caregiving demands particular courage and commitment.To become an adoptive parent or stepparent, she says, “is to step into a role that, in a lot of ways, is harder than the biological one. You’re starting at a place where the child is, not where they began, and you’re building a relationship with them from that place. You are challenged to shift and change and grow.”Greene’s four stepchildren are adults, “but that applies to me, too,” she says. “We do family dinners; we start traditions we didn’t have before. It is a lot of good work.”Like Harris and Blackstone, Greene generally avoids the term stepchildren: “I refer to them as my kids, or my bonus kids. And I’ve allowed those kids to define what my relationship is to them and followed their lead.”When she saw the recent criticism of Harris, Greene says she felt a deep sense of recognition — and fury.“This would not be levied at her if she was a man. It wouldn’t even be a point of consideration,” she says. “This smoke and mirrors and gaslighting that we’re seeing is par for the course when you’re a Black woman. I would laugh in the face of someone who dared to try to tell me what a real parent is and what it is not.”Then she pauses, and does start to laugh. “I am excited to hopefully watch her just brush that right off and keep her focus,” she says. “Those are her kids. End of story.”"
WaPo_15,The cardboard Olympic beds aren’t ‘anti-sex.’ But are they comfy?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/07/24/cardboard-beds-olympic-athletes-paris/,2024-07-25 04:00:19.122200,,"When athletes arrived at the Paris Olympic Village, a few immediately noted a decor choice in their otherwise sparse rooms: a cardboard bed frame.“There is always a lot of talk about the beds in the Olympic Village, so here is what they look like!” British springboard diver Tom Daley wrote on Instagram, alongside a video displaying the digs. The bed, composed of cardboard boxes, resembles someone’s porch after a late night of online shopping.While a cardboard bed doesn’t sound particularly comfortable, only the bed frame is made out of the material. A regular mattress and a mattress topper rest atop the cardboard foundation, with a Paris 2024 Olympic duvet finishing the look. So it’s not like the athletes are actually sleeping directly on heavy paper.“I’ve had a ton of people asking me if the beds are really cardboard, and the answer is yes and no” Evy Leibfarth, a Team USA canoeist, said on TikTok. “They’re definitely mostly cardboard, but we’re, like, sleeping on a mattress. We’re not sleeping on, like, something super hard.”This isn’t the first Olympics with cardboard bed frames — the furniture made its debut in Tokyo in 2021, where it drew similar attention from athletes and onlookers. That’s also when the beds got the infamous — and inaccurate — reputation of being “anti-sex.” Rumors circulated that the beds were constructed with cardboard to prevent athletes from getting intimate with one another and potentially spreading covid.But the beds can withstand vigorous activity, as multiple athletes have demonstrated on social media by jumping, somersaulting and otherwise showing their physical prowess atop the cardboard frames. For the second Olympics in a row, Irish gymnast Rhys McClenaghan posted a video of himself performing a “rigorous” test of the beds’ strength, and once again the cardboard was sturdy enough to pass. He called the “anti-sex” nickname “fake, fake news!”The cardboard bed frames were designed with sustainability, rather than chastity, in mind. “The organizing committee was thinking about recyclable items, and the bed was one of the ideas,” Takashi Kitajima, the general manager of the Tokyo Athletes Village, told the Associated Press in 2020. The beds can hold 200 kilograms of weight, per Kitajima, which is about 440 pounds. After the games, the frames could be recycled into paper products.The organizers of the Paris Olympics, who have promised to keep emissions from the event historically low, adopted the bed frame design. “These are the famous Tokyo 2020 beds that made it to Paris 2024,” a TikTok posted by the official Olympics account earlier this month states. “These sustainable beds are 100 percent made in France and will be fully recycled in France after the Games.”And athletes who want to make the beds better suit their sleeping preferences have some options, including adjusting the firmness and extending the length.U.S. swimmer Katie Ledecky is satisfied with the beds: “I’ve slept well the last two nights, so I have no complaints.”But Angelica Delgado, a U.S. judo athlete, had a less ringing endorsement: “The cardboard beds are a bit stiff, but it’s okay.”Adam Kilgore and Dave Sheinin in Paris contributed to this report."
WaPo_16,Grieving dad disparages his living son. Hax readers give advice.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/advice/2024/07/24/carolyn-hax-grieving-dad-living-son/,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"We asked readers to channel their inner Carolyn Hax and answer this question. Some of the best responses are below.Dear Carolyn: My older brother died by suicide a few years ago. He was 28. He was a gifted athlete, charming, gifted academically, had so many friends, etc. I’m the younger brother and I’m none of those things and I still like my life and I’m happy. Except for my relationship with my dad.He makes comments about how I’m not like my brother and don’t act like him, and he repeats that my brother was the son that everyone wished they had. I know he’s grieving and misses my brother, and my guess is he is depressed. He refuses all conversation about how he’s feeling and rejects the idea of therapy or a grief group. My mom and he divorced when we were little and don’t really like one another, but my mom did try reaching out, parent-to-parent, and got nothing from him. I just want to never talk to him again. Is that an option?— ForgottenForgotten: It’s definitely an option. And even if “never talk to him again” is more than you want to decide right now, you’d be justified not to talk to him again until he shapes up and sincerely apologizes for how he’s treating you.You don’t say anything about your relationship before your brother’s death. If his recent comments are inconsistent with the man you knew growing up, then you have reason to hope that as he heals, he’ll come to realize how badly he’s hurt you and want to make amends. If there’s a history of his ranking his sons like this, though, then you’ve got more than a recent-comments problem, you have a lifetime-of-emotional-abuse problem.In neither case will sticking around as his emotional punching bag benefit either of you. And if, in a few years, he does come out of this dark place, then you can be honest about how he’s hurt you and decide how much grace you want to extend then.— TurtleForgotten: I suggest you have a conversation with your dad at a moment when neither of you is charged up. Tell him you’d like to talk to him about something you have been thinking about. Ask him if he will just listen to you without responding and then mirror back what you have said to him. Then tell him how it feels to be negatively compared to your brother, making “I” statements rather than “you” statements as much as possible. Speak as much as you can from your own feelings and vulnerability. When he mirrors you back, correct him until he has it right. Then ask him to express how he’s feeling and do the same thing.My guess is at the end of that conversation, you will feel a lot closer to each other, and it will set the stage for further communication. And yes, you can just not see him again. That’s always an option, but if there’s a potential for healing, that’s always better.— DirectForgotten: You need to see the movie “Ordinary People” directed by Robert Redford.Forgotten: You have clearly survived so much. And you absolutely have the right to cut off your emotionally abusive father. However, there is another path. A few years ago, I considered writing off my parents, who were emotionally and physically abusive during my upbringing. Working with a therapist, I chose instead to radically redraw the boundaries of our relationship but keep them in my life.The result was that I ultimately learned things about them and myself that proved essential in the larger work of shedding so much familial baggage and becoming a fully realized human being. They have grown too, although not as much as I might have hoped for. And so, a few years down the road, with these newer boundaries, I now have a relationship in which there is also room for love.— Been thereForgotten: I am so incredibly sorry for the loss of your brother and the hurtful things your father says to you. Grief and depression are no excuse for cruelty. My sister died by suicide when I was 18. Twenty years later, I can still feel like I live in her shadow, and my parents have never compared her to any of our siblings. My heart hurts for you.First, I hope you have a good support system: a therapist, a support group, friends and maybe a psychiatrist. They will help you continue to deal with your grief, but more importantly, to provide you the support and decency your father will not. Next, I suggest leaving your mom out of this. Your relationship with your father is between the two of you, and it would be inappropriate for you to ask her to become involved — even if they were still married.Have you told your father how his words are making you feel? I think you could give him a chance to see how his words impact you and to change before you cut him out. I suggest writing a letter or email. It gives you the time to choose the right words, and it gives him the space to process what you’re saying. First, I would validate his grief. Then I would express how his comparisons to your brother make you feel with examples. Then, I would define the boundaries of your conversations.After that, hold him to it. If he starts in again, change the subject, walk away, hang up the phone. Engage again when you feel comfortable. If he continues and you have to create more distance, then you will do so knowing you tried your hardest to maintain a relationship with your devastated father.— Best EffortsEvery week, we ask readers to answer a question submitted to Carolyn Hax’s live chat or email.

WaPo_17,"Why this deviant, looping typhoon is stunning meteorologists",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/24/typhoon-gaemi-path-taiwan-explained/,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"Typhoon Gaemi, a powerful Pacific storm, is blasting Taiwan after tracing a bizarre loop-de-loop that has bewildered meteorologists and had disastrous consequences for the country’s residents and infrastructure.Meteorologists expressed astonishment on social media as they watched the typhoon — equivalent in strength to a Category 3 hurricane — take an improbable and perplexing path that meant Taiwan’s east coast was hammered by the storm’s intense inner core twice.The storm’s unusual track was described as “absolutely wild,” “ludicrous” and “crazy.”The storm, which is producing sustained winds of 125 mph and gusts to 155 mph, recently attempted landfall for the second time — in roughly the same zone that it narrowly missed hours earlier.As a result, coastal parts of eastern and particularly northeast Taiwan have been subjected to a protracted period of severe to extreme winds, a perilous ocean surge and torrential rains — which are expected to cause flash flooding and mudslides in the higher terrain.Typhoon #Gaemi is now turning back for a second attempt at landfall 😵‍💫 pic.twitter.com/Q0KcWmcVlaTropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons, etc.) are prone to wobbling sometimes; like a spinning top, they sometimes jog left or right. Meteorologists call these “trochoidal wobbles.” But this isn’t what Gaemi did.Instead, Gaemi charged westward toward the coast with its ferocious eyewall, the zone of violent winds surrounding its calm center, lashing the shoreline. Then it made a hard left turn, banked south, then curved east and eventually north, tracing a full counterclockwise loop. Then it weakened before heading inland in northeast Taiwan.Getting a hurricane to change direction is an enormous feat; imagine a freight train trying to slow down. A hurricane will only change direction if the overarching steering currents change or something prompts a restructuring of its inner core.In this instance, Gaemi was running into mountainous terrain. The Chungyang Range and the Xueshan Mountains both reach 10,000 feet or higher in northern Taiwan.According to research, the mountains have the effect of deflecting an incoming storm southward initially before it rebounds to the north.Interestingly, an artificial intelligence model simulated the possibility of this sort of motion as early as several days ago. There is precedent for this type of deviant motion to occur as storms approach Taiwan. A 2018 study found that, of 84 landfalling tropical cyclones, seven traced full loops offshore of Taiwan. A total of 49 experienced some leftward motion, and 18 had a large deflection to the left.Sometimes, the track deflection isn't just a turn to the south as it approaches the island... there are historical examples of typhoons making entire loops along the east coast of #Taiwan.This is Figure 1c from the Hsu et al. (2018) paper: https://t.co/PTfuuIVqNp#TyphoonGaemi https://t.co/Ptizcy4en4 pic.twitter.com/1lamIxkwQkGaemi rapidly intensified from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm overnight Tuesday into Wednesday local time, peaking with winds around 150 mph.As of 12:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, the eye — slightly degraded and weaker than it was at peak Category 4 intensity earlier — was moving ashore between Xiulin and Nan’ao, affecting Yulin County. In the mountains, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration hoisted extremely torrential rain advisories, with torrential rain advisories in effect for much of the country’s coastal lowlands. The entirety of Taiwan is under a land typhoon warning.Where the eye is moving ashore, winds may gust 100 to 120 mph at the immediate coastline and in the higher terrain. Several feet of rain are expected in the mountains. Taipei, which is in the storm’s northern eyewall, will likely experience 75 to 95 mph gusts, with a foot of rain possible too.Social media video showed the storm knocking people off their feet, and unleashing flying debris and blinding sheets of rain. Initial measurements indicated some mountainous areas had received at least three feet of rain.Jason Samenow contributed to this report."
WaPo_18,The Olympics haven’t begun. The gold for absurdity goes to the IOC.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/ioc-wada-travis-tygart-china-doping/,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"PARIS — Ah, oui. Bonjour. [Cheek kiss left, cheek kiss right.] Let’s check in on the International Olympic Committee, between its brie and its Burgundy, as the Paris Summer Games approach.Here’s Thomas Bach, the IOC supreme czar, awarding the 2034 Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City, smiling even as he grabs the arms of Utah officials and holds them behind their backs.Here is an array of IOC members, at their pre-Olympic meeting, preceding what was to be a ceremonial vote on Salt Lake City’s candidacy — running against the 2002 hosts for right (burden?) to host another Games was, precisely, no one — with a slew of warnings to U.S. and Utah honchos that they must respect the “supreme authority” of the World Anti-Doping Authority when it comes to keeping the Olympics clean. Kiss the rings, please. All five of them.Who are they talking about? They may as well have said “rhymes with Cravis Kygart,” they came so close to naming Travis Tygart — the head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Authority and frequently a forceful critic of WADA.And then here is Tygart, placed squarely in the crosshairs by the IOC’s higher-ups, firing back with a statement that essentially said, “I’m the problem? No, you’re the problem.”In his actual words, Tygart said, “It is disappointing to see WADA stoop to threats and scare tactics when confronted with a blatant violation of the rules governing anti-doping.” He piled on by accusing WADA of “egregious errors” and mocking that a “potent drug ‘magically appeared’ in a kitchen and led to 23 positive tests of elite Chinese swimmers.”Oh, right, the Chinese swimmers. Because their inclusion at these Summer Games is so clearly tied to whether Salt Lake City should land a Winter Olympics a dozen years from now. Could there have been incentive for WADA — and, by extension, the IOC — to accept the explanation of Chinese officials that the mass positives were due to contamination in a hotel kitchen because Beijing was set to host the 2022 Winter Games? (Raises eyebrows.)Back to the present. Eleven of the athletes who produced those positive tests in the run-up to the 2021 Tokyo Games are back for more. A few are serious threats to win medals. Shouldn’t that be the major concern here?“I hope everyone here is going to be competing clean this week,” said none other than seven-time gold medalist Katie Ledecky, who begins her swimming competition Saturday. “But what really matters also is: Were they training clean?”Man, the Olympics really bring the world together, don’t they?So before the Paris Games begin, the gold medal for absurdity already has been hung around the neck of the IOC. Cue their anthem.Now, let’s be clear: It’s not crazy to think that American federal oversight of international sport is an overreach. Looking to Congress to provide moral guidance on anything would seem to be a flawed approach. And it’s not as if American athletes haven’t cheated. Fraudulence doesn’t fly a specific flag or speak only one language.But the IOC is no better equipped to serve as a compass. The reality is that the Olympics governing body is having so much trouble finding sites for future Olympics, particularly in the winter, it’s having to bend its own rules just to pull it off. Also Wednesday, the pooh-bahs gave the 2030 Winter Games to the French Alps — provisionally. The contract contains language that France must prove it is capable of staging such a spectacle in smaller resort towns — or lose those Olympics. Which are all of — checks watch — five-and-a-half years off.That threat is a peck on the cheek compared to the doozies that showed up later Wednesday. The vote to approve Salt Lake City was supposed to be a rubber stamp. At 83-6, it effectively was. But it was preceded by two unforeseen developments that, even for a perpetually double-speaking Olympic “movement,” were dizzying.First, the thinly veiled shaming of Tygart by IOC members, with only the Salt Lake City bid organizers on hand to take the brunt of it. The organization that runs — and profits from — the Games wants WADA to be the final word on doping matters. At this point, that’s folly. First, WADA can’t be considered an independent arbiter: Its 42-m ember board features 11 IOC members. These are not separate legislative and judicial bodies so much as conjoined twins.But while the IOC is clearly tired of Tygart’s rhetoric — he has slammed WADA after the New York Times initially reported news of the positive Chinese tests — it also is wary of efforts by the American government to involve itself in the policing of sport. The IOC and WADA — again, in lockstep, because they share a brain — fought against the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, the 2021 law that brazenly allows the FBI, among others, to investigate doping.“Regretfully, this is another example of the politicization of sport,” Belgian IOC member Ingmar De Vos said. “ … But we really need to understand what is going to happen in the future, and where is this going to end?”Turns out: Not before the IOC dropped the day’s biggest bomb. Bach said the IOC, USOPC and the Salt Lake City bid officials had agreed to amend the Olympic host city contract. Bach did not physically stand up on the dais and turn screws in the back of bid president Fraser Bullock, but he might as well have. The upshot: Get your people in order as it pertains for WADA, or you could lose the Games.These are strongman tactics, and they were immediately called out as such. Not just by Tygart, who majors in bluster. The chair and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which heard testimony from Tygart and Olympic legend Michael Phelps on WADA’s shortcomings, fired off a statement saying: “It speaks volumes that the IOC would demand a one-sided contract condition to protect WADA rather than work together to ensure it is fulfilling its mission to protect clean sport.”Makes the head spin. But there’s more: In his scathing remarks, De Vos not only referred to the strength of the Salt Lake City bid, but commended Gene Sykes, the president of the USOPC board, for listening to the IOC’s concerns. Bach referred to Sykes as a “friend.”You know what happened later in the day? You guessed it. Sykes was approved as an IOC member. It’s an incestuous world. They’re just living in it.With the Paris Games about to begin, it’s both predictable and regrettable that a fiasco involving starched shirts detracts from the athletes who produce the product that allows the IOC members to buy those starched shirts.Ms. Ledecky, please?“I think everyone’s heard what the athletes think,” Ledecky said. “They want transparency. They want further answers to the questions that still remain. At this point, we’re here to race. We’re going to race whoever’s in the lanes next to us.“We’re not the ones paid to do the testing. So we hope that the people that are follow their own rules, and that applies now and into the future. And we want to see some change for the future so that you don’t have to ask us that question.”Who’s going to force such transparency from WADA? The IOC? The Olympics and the body that determines whether its competitions are clean are one in the same. Separating them would require ceding control and allowing independent evaluation. Wednesday showed the IOC prefers backroom deals and arm-twisting to get what it wants."
WaPo_19,House GOP leaders ask members to stop making racial attacks against Harris,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/24/house-republicans-harris-racial-attacks/,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"House Republican leaders, including Speaker Mike Johnson, have asked their members not to make comments about Vice President Harris’s race after a number of GOP lawmakers referenced her identity in attacks on the likely Democratic presidential nominee.Almost immediately after President Biden announced Sunday that he was endorsing Harris to replace him on the ticket, Republicans began their offensive, with some veering into attacks over the race and gender of the first Black and South Asian woman to serve as vice president.In a closed-door conference meeting on Tuesday, House GOP leaders, including Johnson (La.) and Rep. Richard Hudson (N.C.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Republicans to focus on Harris’s policy record and time in the administration rather than go after her identity, according to multiple people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal conversations. Politico first reported on the meeting.Johnson later told reporters that the he thinks Republicans should make the election “about policies, not personalities.”Following Harris’s emergence as a likely Biden replacement, Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), in a post on X, called Harris a “DEI vice president” — referring to “diversity, equity and inclusion.” House Republicans have sought to counter such diversity initiatives in federal programs through the funding process.Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.), who defeated former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) in 2022, told a reporter that she thinks Harris is “a DEI hire.” And Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) told a CBS affiliate that Democrats chose Harris as the likely nominee “because of her ethnic background.”In recent years, conservatives have targeted “DEI” programs — often used at workplaces to diversify the workforce — because they say they lead to minorities getting jobs over White candidates.Other Republicans echoed Johnson’s admonition. In an interview with The Washington Post, Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio) said members attacking Harris’s race “need to keep their mouths shut and just worry about their [district] race.”“I think Vice President Harris and former president Trump is the match and let those two talk about each other,” he said.Democrats, meanwhile, chided Republicans for attacking Harris’s identity.“DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. That means all of us, not some of us,” said Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. “So they’re trying to just make their attacks — some sad ones, too, that we’ve seen — but we’ll get past that, and she’ll get past that.”“It’s a strategy that’s going to backfire,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) told CNN. “The majority of Americans — women — know what this feels like, to do everything you can to get your credentials, college education, advanced degrees, and, no matter what you do, people say you’re not enough. Or that you don’t belong in that room.”Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) said that those calling Harris a “DEI candidate” forget that she has “more experience than Trump and J.D. Vance combined times a million.”“She worked at the state level. She was the [California] attorney general. She’s vice president of the United States. She was a senator representing one of the largest states in the entire country,” he told CNN. “These are just racist dog whistles.”On Wednesday, Burchett said that while he wishes he hadn’t made those comments about Harris, “it was the truth.”“It’s not racist behavior,” he told SiriusXM. “That’s the furthest thing from my mind. I just want the best players put in.”"
WaPo_20,"Jayden Daniels is splitting reps as training camp starts, but that won’t last",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/jayden-daniels-commanders-training-camp/,2024-07-25 03:00:19.122200,,"Even though Jayden Daniels split first-team reps with Marcus Mariota on Wednesday, the first day of Washington Commanders training camp, it’s still clear the team is not holding a real quarterback “competition” this summer.It’s more accurate to say it is Daniels’s job to lose, and that first-year coach Dan Quinn, who arrived preaching the virtues of competition, seems to be calling it a “competition” because he feels compelled to make every player compete for everything — no exceptions.So, Daniels — barring injury or major regression — is expected to start the season opener. The next questions are: Will splitting reps slow his ability to build rapport with offensive teammates? And how long will he share time with Mariota before Quinn officially names the rookie the starter?For now, splitting reps will slow offensive cohesion “for some people more than others,” right tackle Andrew Wylie said, but he noted the team has nearly seven weeks before its Week 1 opener at Tampa Bay.The quarterback rotation isn’t a big deal, added star wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who has caught passes from 11 quarterbacks in his five-year career.“I’ve been able to adapt,” he said with a sort of verbal shrug. “I think it just forces everybody to communicate a little bit more.”During their first practice, the Commanders focused on the red zone, and Daniels was clearly the team’s best quarterback. He showed confidence and crispness with tight-window throws and dropped a beautiful lob into the back right corner of the end zone for running back Brian Robinson Jr. Daniels rarely used his legs to escape trouble and did not throw an interception.In the high red zone, McLaurin was impressed by Daniels’s ball placement on one short “hitch” route, which he said is usually difficult to complete when a defensive back has help behind him and can play tighter coverage without having to worry about getting beaten down the field.In this case, Daniels threw the ball low and away, which may have looked awkward because it forced McLaurin to twist backward to make the catch, but the receiver thought it was perfect because only he could make a play on it.Afterward, McLaurin said, he and Daniels talked about how the throw could have been delivered high to his outside shoulder as well.“He just has a natural feel for [ball placement], and you can see it by the way he operates,” McLaurin said. “It’s not always going to be perfect, but just to have that mindset. … I’m expecting that now. So, when I come out my routes, I have a good idea where he is going to put it.”The team started with red zone work, Quinn said, because condensed spacing allows players to ramp up slowly and forces them to make quicker decisions. That’s why, he said, the coaching staff won’t grade the tape solely on completions.“What was the decision-making process that went along with it?” said Quinn, who spoke before practice. “It is the time that you have to push yourself to see if you can make some plays. … If you never push those boundaries to see what you are capable of, you’ll never know how far you can take it in a game. Because you certainly don’t want to be risk averse where you’re so tight that you don’t want to make a play. But there also has to be the balance.”The lack of competition between Daniels and Mariota does not mean the team is without a quarterback battle. Veteran Jeff Driskel and undrafted rookie Sam Hartman seem to be fighting for the third spot, which in the dog days of summer might not seem important but is certainly something the new regime cares about.Two seasons ago, General Manager Adam Peters was with San Francisco’s front office when injuries to the top two quarterbacks forced the 49ers to use running back Christian McCaffrey as a wildcat quarterback in the NFC championship game.On Wednesday, Driskel was ahead of Hartman in reps. It’s unclear if the team will keep its third quarterback on the active roster or practice squad. But it’s clear what will happen at the top of the depth chart."

WaPo_22,What you can learn about salmon from its packaging,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2024/salmon-labeling-wild-farm-species-explained/,2024-07-24 21:00:19.122200,,"If you’ve ever shopped for salmon, you’ve probably found yourself wavering between a jumble of options. But a scan of the packages — typically emblazoned with various claims about sustainability and nutrition — might not be much help.
This problem isn’t unique to salmon, the second most popular seafood eaten in the United States after shrimp. Many shoppers want to make better choices for themselves and for the environment, but product labels are often confusing or sparse.
“A lot of packaging doesn’t include the information needed,” said Ben Halpern, a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
We examined more than a dozen packages of salmon sold at major grocery stores and spoke with experts about how to better understand common labels. Here’s what we learned.
Most salmon packaging will clearly state whether the fish was wild-caught or farmed. If a package doesn’t specify wild-caught or farm-raised, you can probably assume it’s farmed.
Whether farmed salmon is environmentally friendly will depend on how it was raised.

In the United States, wild salmon stocks are generally well managed and highly regulated, which means they are less likely to be overfished. An added bonus: Wild salmon is a nutrient-rich and lean source of protein.
But wild-caught fish can be more expensive than farmed options and is not always as easy to find.
Farm-raised fish is generally cheaper, though it is less environmentally friendly, according to several experts. Salmon farms have historically relied on the widespread use of antibiotics and pesticides.  Captive fish can also escape their pens and change the genetic makeup of wild stocks.
However, some major salmon-producing countries have improved their farming practices over the years and many farms now use fewer chemicals.
Some farmed-raised salmon might not be as pink as their wild counterparts, which naturally get their color by eating wild shrimp. But farmed fish can also be dyed during processing, so keep an eye out for labels that say “color added.” In other cases, farms could use feed containing a type of carotenoid, or naturally occurring pigment, that gives their flesh a pinker color.
The filets of farmed fish tend to be fattier, but that can keep them more moist when cooked.
“Farmed salmon is really overall a strong option,” said Halpern.

The global seafood supply chain can be murky. If a product includes details about the species of salmon, you can be more confident that the fish you’re buying is what the packaging says it is. This information helps combat seafood fraud and signals a greater level of transparency and traceability for the product.
Be wary of packaging that doesn’t include specifics about the type of salmon inside.
Some packaging will include 
the scientific name of the 
salmon, which provides more 
confidence that the label 
accurately reflects the fish 
you’re getting. The scientific 
name might be in parentheses 
in the ingredients section on 
the back of the package.

Where your fish was caught or farmed is one of the most important pieces of information for gauging sustainability. Fishing and farming practices and regulations can vary widely depending on country.
Most wild salmon in the United States is fished in Alaskan waters. Meanwhile, a majority of farmed fish sold domestically is imported from Chile, Canada or Norway.

To figure out if you’re buying sustainably farmed fish, look at the species in addition to the country of origin. For example, Chinook salmon from New Zealand is raised responsibly, according to Seafood Watch. You should generally avoid farm-raised Atlantic salmon from Canada, Chile, Norway or Scotland, according to the program. For more information, check Seafood Watch’s sustainable salmon guide.
But knowing the exact origin of the fish you’re buying can be tricky.
If the label says “product of” a country, it may not be where the fish was caught or farmed. That designation only tells you where the fish was last “substantially transformed,” Valentine said.
Sometimes you’ll find two 
countries listed on the 
same package, such as this 
one. The fish was caught in 
U.S. waters, but sent to 
China to be processed and 
imported back to be sold in 
American supermarkets.
“This comes with a decent 
amount of risk,” Valentine 
said. “There’s opportunities 
for fraud and mislabeling 
and importers buying 
products that they don’t
actually realize are not what 
they’re paying for.”

Take a fish stick, for example. The country you see listed in the package is likely not where the fish was caught, but where it was transformed into a fish stick. “It becomes a product of that country, even if it was caught in Alaskan waters,” she said.
Many salmon products have various sustainability logos with phrases such as “Responsible choice” or “Sustainably sourced.” These are not all created equal and it’s important to distinguish vanity labels from vetted certifications.

“We have to be careful with labels because they can be self-created or self-certified,” Valentine said.
Seafood Watch generally recommends wild-caught fish certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit focused on ending overfishing. For farmed fish, it suggests looking for the label from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, another nonprofit, dedicated to increasing sustainability in seafood farming.
But while these certifications can be a good indication that your fish is sustainable, don’t rely on them, Halpern said.
“They’re not a true signal because you can be sustainable and not have gotten certified,” he said.
Don’t get distracted by busy labels. The information on salmon packaging should be clear and easy to understand, Valentine said.
Think about what’s important to you. If it’s cost, farmed Chilean salmon tends to be more affordable, but may not be as sustainable as wild-caught options. If it’s sustainability, experts recommend wild-caught Alaskan salmon processed domestically — but keep in mind that it probably comes with a higher price tag. If it’s taste or nutrition, wild-caught sockeye salmon might be your pick. Some experts say the fish has a stronger salmon flavor than other species.
Regardless of the kind of salmon you buy, fish is a better choice for the environment than chicken, beef and other types of land-based animal protein.
Wild and farmed salmon generate less pollution and disturb less habitat than the same amount of pork, beef or chicken protein, according to Halpern’s study from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.
“Salmon and other fish are just a far more sustainable way of getting animal protein than almost anything else we can eat,” he said."
WaPo_23,Harris is a gaffe-prone leftist. Why didn’t anyone challenge her?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/24/democrats-kamala-harris-no-challengers/,2024-07-25 04:15:19.122200,,"That was fast! On Sunday, after President Biden announced he would not run for a second term, Vice President Harris declared her intention to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination. In less than 24 hours, she had apparently secured all the delegates needed to lock up the nomination.Which raises a question: Why did no one challenge her? After all, Harris is undeniably vulnerable. She ran a catastrophic campaign for president four years ago, flaming out before even reaching the Iowa caucuses. Her public approval has hovered around that of Biden, who is himself one of the most unpopular presidents in 70 years. She is also less popular than former president Donald Trump, the man she must beat. Indeed, The Post’s recent average of 11 polls conducted since the debate found little difference between how she and Biden stack up against Trump.She is as gaffe-prone as Biden, but without the excuse of advanced age. She has a grating habit of saying simple-minded things in a profound voice (“There is great significance to the passage of time”) and of talking to voters as though they are small children (“Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine.”). She is an episode of “Veep” come to life.And unlike Biden, who at least had the veneer of moderation, she is an unabashed leftist. She has supported the Democratic so­cialist agenda, from the Green New Deal to Medicare-for-all.  In her 2019 campaign, she proposed a mind-boggling $45.5 trillion in new spending, according to Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl. She pledged to ban fracking (which won’t go over well in must-win Pennsylvania) and promised to decriminalize illegal border crossings and provide taxpayer-funded health care for illegal migrants (which might explain her catastrophic failure as Biden’s border czar). She is an abortion zealot who became the first vice president to campaign at an abortion clinic and has suggested that a Catholic who belongs to the Knights of Columbus was unfit to serve as a federal judge. She raised money for a bail fund that helped put people accused and later convicted of violent crimes back on the streets, and she supports giving former prisoners, including rapists and murderers, the right to vote.She would be the most radical candidate ever to secure the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Four years ago, Democrats panicked at the prospect that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might be their nominee and chose Biden instead. Well, Harris’s Senate voting record was to the left of Sanders — in fact, it was the furthest left of the entire U.S. Senate, according to the nonpartisan government transparency watchdog GovTrack.And as Biden’s vice president, she maintains ownership of all the disastrous policies that dragged down his approval ratings. She cast the deciding vote for the massive spending package that unleashed the worst inflation in four decades, presided over the worst border crisis in American history, and helped lead the coverup of Biden’s cognitive decline, repeatedly assuring the American people that the president was “vibrant,” “tireless” and “absolutely authoritative in rooms around the globe” as well as in the Oval Office.So why didn’t a more electable candidate — of which there are many — throw his or her hat in the ring and seek the Democratic nomination? Simple: If you are a White Democrat — such as Govs. Josh Shapiro (Pa.), Andy Beshear (Ky.), Roy Cooper (N.C.), Tim Walz (Minn.) and Gretchen Whitmer (Mich.), or Sen. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) — with a seemingly bright political future in Democratic politics, why would you get crosswise with Rep. James E. Clyburn (S.C.) and the Congressional Black Caucus by trying to stop the first Black woman from leading a major party ticket? The party of identity politics is never going to pick you over her. And if you try to challenge her, she will play the race card against you — just as she did against Biden in 2019.Maybe it’s because the Democrats have spent the three weeks since Biden’s disastrous debate in utter chaos — and don’t want another three weeks of chaos that even a “mini-primary” (whatever that is) would entail. That might be a mistake. Harris is just one cringe-inducing interview or word salad away from sending Democrats back into panic mode. And Republicans will use her far-left record to defeat not only her but also vulnerable Democrats running in swing states who will now have to defend her.Besides, if Trump wins, he’ll be a one-term president — which means those potential challengers would be able to run for an open seat four years from now. Heck, Harris could pick one of them for vice president, which would allow them to raise their national profile with a strong debate performance, without anyone blaming them for losing the White House.Indeed, the fact that so many electable Democrats are choosing to keep their powder dry for 2028 shows that they really don’t believe Trump is a threat to democracy. They all seem confident that if Trump wins in November, there will still be a free and fair election four years from now in which they can compete.They’re right."
WaPo_24,Harris vows to fight ‘extremists’ on day of dueling events with Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/24/harris-trump-presidential-campaign/,2024-07-25 04:10:19.122200,,"INDIANAPOLIS — Vice President Harris, in a Wednesday afternoon address here, cast the 2024 election as a fight against “extremists” who want to take the country backward, delivering one of her first speeches as the likely Democratic nominee for president to women who represent the base voters she needs to energize.“We are not going back,” she told the crowd of thousands, to big cheers.Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, is set to take the stage a few hours later in Charlotte for his first rally since President Biden withdrew from the 2024 race — an event that will set the stage for Trump’s new campaign against Harris.The dueling appearances are a chance for each candidate to frame the stakes of the race as it plunges into uncharted territory, with Trump no longer running against his ideal opponent and Harris seeking to take charge of the Democratic ticket a little more than 100 days before the election. Democrats are hoping that Harris can refocus the contest on Trump’s flaws, while Republicans want to quickly define Harris and saddle her with Biden’s weaknesses.Biden’s exit — triggered by a dismal June debate performance — has filled Democrats with new hope for November. In a Wednesday morning memo, Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said the vice president is less known than Trump and Biden and “opens up additional persuadable voters,” especially in groups that lean Democratic. “This race is more fluid now,” she wrote.Trump’s team, meanwhile, is bracing for a “Harris honeymoon” that it says could intrude on Trump’s summer of momentum and polling gains. In a Tuesday memo, Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted that Harris would see a polling bump starting in the next few days — but he said it would pass. With voters upset about inflation, the border and other issues, he wrote, the “fundamentals of the race stay the same.”A CNN poll published Wednesday found that Harris performed better than Biden against Trump, gaining more support from young voters, women and Black and Hispanic voters. Trump still led their poll of registered voters nationwide 49 percent to 46 percent, within the margin of error.Harris arrived in Indianapolis just before noon on Wednesday and delivered a 15-minute keynote speech there at the Grand Boulé, the national convention of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority. Zeta Phi Beta is one of the “Divine Nine,” a group of historically Black sororities and fraternities that includes Harris’s sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.Women across the convention hall stood up to applaud several times throughout the speech. Some live-streamed the remarks on their Facebook accounts. They cheered loudest when Harris said, while discussing abortion rights, “When I am president of the United States … ”Harris praised Biden as “a leader with a bold vision” before moving on to her pitch. She ticked through policies such as a new government rule to remove medical debt from credit reports. She zeroed in on Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that is independent of the Trump campaign but counts many former Trump aides among its creators.Trump has aggressively tried to distance himself from Project 2025 as Democrats attack it, and over the weekend called it “seriously extreme.”Harris called Project 2025 “a plan to return America to a dark past.” The audience booed when she mentioned the initiative and laughed when she said, “Can you believe they put that in writing?”“In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions of our nation,” Harris said. “One focused on the future, the other focused on the past. And with your support I am fighting for our nation’s future.”Democrats are hopeful that Harris — who is Black and Indian American and would be the first female president — can motivate key left-leaning constituencies in a way that Biden did not. The sorority Harris addressed is nonpartisan, but Black women have long been a key voting bloc for the Democratic Party. While the Divine Nine does not endorse candidates, officials say it will work aggressively to mobilize voters ahead of the election.In interviews, Black women gathered for the Grand Boulé said they were excited about Harris’s candidacy but also nervous about her chances. They worried that voters would hold her race and gender against her.“If you had your eyes closed and you just go based on her qualifications versus [Trump’s] qualifications, yes, she’d definitely win,” said Lora Rice, 55, from Georgia. “But they’re not going to do that.” She said Biden, “the White guy,” would have had a better shot.Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), a Zeta who traveled with Harris, drew massive applause when she called to “reclaim the words that are being used against us, like diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, being the most qualified” — and said, “let’s let our values lead us into a bold, Black and very female future from Kamala Harris.”Hillary Clinton, who made history as the country’s only female presidential nominee from a major party and lost to Trump in 2016, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that Harris’s “record and character will be distorted and disparaged” as she runs against Trump, and that “she and the campaign will have to cut through the noise.”Stacie NC Grant, the president and CEO of Zeta Phi Beta, said she was thrilled to have Harris speaking before the convention’s roughly 6,000 attendees. “It is hard to put into words what it feels like to be living history because that is where we are right now,” she said.“It’s a serendipitous moment,” Grant added.In her campaign memo, O’Malley Dillon laid out her case for confidence in Harris. She led the charge on abortion rights, an issue on which Democrats have demonstrated a clear political advantage. In Milwaukee on Tuesday, she drew the campaign’s largest crowd to date. Some $126 million in donations have flooded into the campaign since Sunday, when Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris.O’Malley Dillon said the campaign would continue its focus on the so-called “Blue Wall” states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — as well as the “Sun Belt” battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. “We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,” she wrote.Trump’s campaign is still trying to expand the map: The former president has another rally planned for Saturday evening in Minnesota, a state that Biden won by seven points in 2020.Even as Trump’s campaign pivots to attacking Harris, the former president has tried keep attention on Biden.“Does Lyin’ Kamala Harris think Joe Biden is fit to run the U.S.A. for the next six months? She must answer the question,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media site, on Tuesday.Biden is scheduled to give a speech Wednesday night from the White House about his decision to bow out.After the sorority event, Harris went to Houston, where on Thursday she plans to speak to a convention of the American Federation of Teachers.Trump’s team, eager to needle Harris about immigration policy, quickly highlighted her planned proximity to the southern border.In a brief interview with WBT, a news station in North Carolina, Donald Trump appeared irritated at news reports that Vice President Harris had drawn more than 3,000 people to a Tuesday event in Wisconsin. Trump, who takes pride in his massive rallies, insisted without explanation that the number was too high and added, “If I ever had 3,000, they’d give me front page headlines that nobody showed up.”Trump has several events lined up later this week. He plans to speak Friday evening in West Palm Beach, Fla., at an event hosted by the conservative group Turning Point Action. On Saturday, he will deliver a keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, underscoring his newfound interest in cryptocurrency. Trump was once skeptical of cryptocurrency but has embraced it after aggressive lobbying by executives in the industry.A previous version of this article misstated in one instance the name of the sorority Harris is addressing. It is Zeta Phi Beta. The article has been corrected."
WaPo_25,"The Paris Olympics’ opening act: A rugby party for 70,000",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/rugby-sevens-paris-olympics/,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"SAINT-DENIS, France — A lively brass band met them at the stadium gates, providing the jaunty soundtrack for the party that was about to start. And needless to say, France was ready to dance.They arrived at these Olympics wearing wigs and costumes, waving flags and belting chants. They painted their cheeks with French flags, their hair with French colors. When the home team took the field for the first time at the Paris Games, a giant banner unrolled at one end of the stadium: Allez Les Bleus, the rallying cry of the French national teams.They’d waited for years for this. The torch isn’t yet lit, but the games have effectively begun. France opened play Wednesday in the men’s rugby sevens tournament, the first athletic event for the host nation, which took place in front of an estimated 69,000 fans at the iconic Stade de France. Though the opening match ended in a 12-12 draw against a young American squad, it had the feel of a party, setting a promising tone for the rest of the Games.“Awesome,” said American halfback Madison Hughes, competing in his third Olympics. “That’s what you want as an athlete. You want to perform in front of passionate fans who are really into what you’re doing. Absolutely loved it.”It was a fitting opener. Rugby sevens is a fast-paced, truncated version of one of the world’s most popular sports, and it’s especially beloved in France. Every session of the men’s rugby tournament is sold out.“Rugby in France is hot,” said Australia’s Henry Hutchison, whose team won the first match of the tournament, 21-14, over Samoa. “But it's also a world game, so there's so many people from around the world here.”It is among the most anticipated Olympic sports for locals and a marquee event for organizers, who chose to stage the tournament in the country’s largest stadium. The 26-year-old Stade de France was built for the 1998 World Cup, serves as the home of the men’s national soccer team and has hosted three Rugby World Cups. Last year’s men’s World Cup, staged across France, averaged nearly 51,000 fans over the course of 48 matches.Alan Gilpin, chief executive of World Rugby, the sport’s international governing body, said more than half a million people will file through the stadium gates for the Olympic tournament, and rugby sevens was one of the highest-demand events in Paris.“We really believe this is the Olympic Games where rugby sevens comes of age,” he said.Aurélie Merle, the executive sports director of the Paris Games, said it was no accident that the athletic competition started Wednesday with both rugby sevens and the men’s soccer tournament.“This is the DNA of our Games …” she said. “It’s party time at this sport.”American Orrin Bizer walked out of the stadium tunnel Wednesday focused on what promised to be a consequential match against France. But he couldn’t ignore the rumbling crowd and chuckled when he somehow spotted his sister amid the sea of French flags.“Just seeing the atmosphere, it brought the biggest smile to my face,” he said.The crowd erupted barely three minutes into the match when France’s Jordan Sepho crossed the goal line. It fell eerily silent by half, following a try by American Lucas Lacamp and Stephen Tomasin’s conversion, which gave the United States a 7-5 advantage. The ahhs and the oohs — and occasional sacre bleus — perfectly matched the rhythm of the fast-paced battle.“That was a special crowd,” Hughes said. “Compared to Rio and then Tokyo, which had no crowd whatsoever, it’s awesome for the Olympics to have that atmosphere.”Barely 30 seconds into the second half, Rayan Rebbadj’s try put Les Bleus back in the lead, but then American Marcus Tupuola crossed the goal line with five minutes remaining to tie the match at 12-12. Hughes missed the conversion that would have put the United States on top.The Americans, who were knocked out in the quarterfinals three years ago in Tokyo, weren’t complaining about a draw against a talented team, as they hope to advance out of group play to the knockout rounds here.“To draw with the host nation with all those fans in the stadium, just a test of who the boys are and our character to stay in the fight,” said U.S. wing Perry Baker."
WaPo_26,Kamala Harris vows to revive Biden’s defeated ‘care economy’ plans,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/24/kamala-harris-care-economy-biden/,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris vowed twice this week to revive Democratic plans to expand the welfare state, previewing a campaign message against Donald Trump and potentially signaling one of her top priorities should she be elected.In remarks to campaign staff in Delaware on Monday and a campaign speech in Wisconsin on Tuesday, the vice president focused on key parts of President Biden’s domestic agenda that failed to pass because of resistance from Republicans and centrist Democrats. In both speeches, Harris highlighted the need for legislation to expand paid family leave, housing assistance, child care and eldercare — parts of the “care economy” that advisers say have been one of her top priorities in the administration.“We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty … where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable child care,” Harris said in Wilmington at her campaign headquarters. “Together, we fight to build a nation where every person has affordable health care, where every worker is paid fairly and where every senior can retire with dignity.”Embracing these economic policies could help sharpen the contrast between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in a race that has so far largely been defined by abortion, Trump’s criminal convictions, and questions around Biden’s age and mental acuity. Before dropping out, Biden’s candidacy was also dogged by widespread anger over inflation, and it’s unclear how Harris plans to keep voters from punishing her for that as well.“Trump has been campaigning on the premise that Biden is too old and unfit to serve, and if Harris runs a policy-focused campaign it will be interesting to see if Trump has to respond,” said Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank that pushes free markets, and a former adviser to leading GOP policymakers.1/5The effort is not without risks. Biden’s attempts to pass trillions of dollars in new domestic programs collapsed amid resistance from Sen. Joe Manchin III (I-W. Va.) and criticism even from some Democrats that the administration was trying to approve too many policies simultaneously. Some economists also caution that the United States cannot afford new domestic spending programs with annual deficits of more than $1.5 trillion, although Democrats say they would pay for their plans with higher taxes on the rich.The plans also speak to a broader conundrum for Harris’s candidacy: She will try take credit for the administration’s economic accomplishments, such as low unemployment and fast growth, but will be reluctant to tie herself too closely on the economy to a president who suffered from high disapproval ratings over the highest rate of inflation in decades.So far, Harris has largely endorsed the agenda that Biden campaigned on. But she will also face numerous choices about which part of Biden’s legacy to emphasize on the campaign trail, as well as which aspects of the president’s policy agenda, if any, she wants to jettison. In the past few weeks alone, Biden endorsed numerous controversial ideas, including a cap on rent increases for some units, in a bid to save his sinking candidacy. It’s not clear whether Harris will take these up, revive some of the ambitious policy ideas she ran on during her failed 2020 primary campaign — or go in a different direction altogether. These ideas were not mentioned in Harris’s first two speeches.“The challenge now is she needs to present a policy vision that has to be in line with the administration she served in, while also being unique to her. Do you have enough time to develop something like that and put it forward? Or do you have to run on what the Biden-Harris administration has put out?” said Kenneth Baer, who served as a budget official during the Obama administration. “It’s absolutely uncharted territory, so it’s exciting.”These decisions will likely be shaped in part by a policy brain trust that is likely to evolve over the next few months of the campaign. Harris’s closest economic adviser for most of her tenure as vice president was Mike Pyle, who had served in the Obama administration and at the BlackRock investment firm. Pyle was widely seen as allied with a group of younger Obama alumni, including Brian Deese, Biden’s former director of the National Economic Council. Carolina Ferrerosa Young, a former aide to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), is Harris’s top economic adviser. Many people who have worked with Ferrerosa Young see her in the mold of Brown, a strong defender of labor unions.Harris’s policy priorities have been the subject of speculation for years. Before she became Biden’s running mate, Harris as a senator campaigned for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020 on a different set of far-reaching economic policies, including a $2.8 trillion tax cut that she does not now mention. Her reversals on Medicare-for-all in the 2020 presidential campaign also fueled criticisms that her views on health care were unclear.Two senior Democrats, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be more candid, said that even in private conversations, Harris has been supportive of Biden’s agenda, rarely objecting even on controversial questions among Democrats such as rent caps or mass student debt relief. The Biden-Harris administration’s budget proposal for next year — which reflected Democratic priorities on dozens of issues — is likely to form the starting point for her priorities, they said.“The administration’s 2025 budget lays out her thinking in detail, and as president she might adjust things a bit — but just a bit. I think what we’ve seen from President Biden is what I think Harris will pursue,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “I think she’s cut out of the same economic cloth as President Biden.”But there are some places where Harris could shift the party’s emphasis. In the Senate, Harris unveiled the first “bill of rights” for domestic workers not covered by traditional labor laws. As vice president, Harris has been a forceful advocate for policies aimed at protecting poorly paid child care and eldercare workers, said Ai-jen Poo, president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.“Vice President Harris has been one of our biggest champions on the care agenda — from child care, to paid leave, to aging and disability care. She has been a consistent leader for us,” Poo said.That focus may align with Harris’s political identity. In May, she gave a speech to the Service Employees International Union, which represents millions of workers in the service sector and has a more racially diverse membership than many other unions, where she called on better pay for care workers.“Part of her constituency will clearly be women, clearly be women of color, and clearly families of color — and these are disproportionately folks in the service industry,” said Felicia Wong, president of Roosevelt Forward, the advocacy arm of a left-leaning think tank. “So it’s not just that she knows investing in the care sector is good for the economy and in line with her values … in political terms, she sees an advantage in the care agenda.”Conservatives and Republicans, though, see Harris as a big-spending liberal who has embraced Biden policies that fueled the worst inflation in several decades and added trillions to the federal debt.Trump allies are also planning to criticize Harris over the rise in migration across the U.S.-Mexico border, after she led White House efforts to handle the issue early in the administration.“We will skewer her for her border performance,” said Stephen Moore, a Trump adviser.In terms of new policies, however, the difference between Biden and Harris may ultimately prove limited. Biden already installed allies of the left in important administrative and regulatory positions, and his legislation was constrained by centrist Democrats in Congress who regarded his proposals as too liberal. That obstacle is likely to be the same for Harris even if Democrats retain the Senate.“The administration has already put progressives in charge of most of the agencies markets care about, so there’s not much room for a leftward push there,” said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research and an economic policy staffer to Biden when he was vice president during the Obama administration. “For the most part, this is a political story just about voters’ perceptions of what they stand for. It will likely be a more forceful and cogent articulation of the case against Trump, without that much of an identifiable difference in their proactive Democratic mission.”"
WaPo_27,Donald Trump’s nephew asks questions about racism in new memoir,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/24/fred-trump-all-family-memoir-review/,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"Conspicuously placed in the latest Trump family tell-all is an anecdote that takes on greater relevance since President Biden bowed out of the presidential race on Sunday and endorsed Vice President Harris as his successor, setting up the near certainty that Harris will be the first Black woman to head a national ticket and will face off against former president Donald Trump in November.As told by Fred C. Trump III, the former president’s nephew, in “All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got this Way,” it goes like this: Someone had slashed a two-foot gash in the soft-top of his Uncle Donald’s beloved Cadillac Eldorado convertible. Donald Trump was furious. He called over his young nephew to take a look.Though Donald Trump could not have known who did it, he “disgustedly” blamed Black people, twice using the n-word to describe those he believed to be the culprits.“I knew that was a bad word,” Fred Trump, who spells out the pejorative in full in his book, recalls thinking at the time.Fred Trump’s vividly detailed recollection of that day — which he writes took place when he was a “preteen” in the early 1970s, when Uncle Donald was in his mid- to late 20s — prompts him to ponder whether his uncle was “a racist.” The author cuts his uncle a bit of a break, noting that, in those days, “people said all kinds of crude, thoughtless, prejudiced things.” He also does some equivocating, hyperbolically writing that, “in one way or another, maybe everyone in Queens was a racist then.”Fred’s inclusion of the anecdote would have had much greater punch if he could have shown a pattern of racially inappropriate remarks by his uncle in private family encounters. After all, he writes at great length about the many, and frequently toxic, Trump gatherings he attended with Uncle Donald over the years. He dedicates an entire chapter to race and throws out enough examples to make it clear that he leans toward “yes” when it comes to the question of racism in his family — but he doesn’t quite say it directly.He recounts how his grandfather, the family patriarch, Frederick C. Trump Sr., would use a Yiddish word considered an anti-Black slur. He also revisits the well-plowed Justice Department accusations of discrimination against Black lease applicants at Trump-owned apartments, which ended in the 1970s with a consent decree and no admission of guilt; and he touches on Donald Trump’s over-the-top demands for harsh punishment for the Black and Latino youths known as the Central Park Five, who were wrongfully convicted of assaulting a White female jogger in the late 1980s. He even dips back to the 1920s to recount the lesser-known incident of his grandfather being arrested for failing to disperse at a Ku Klux Klan rally.But in rooting around — literally and figuratively — he finds no Klan robes in his grandfather’s closets and no racist literature, and he doesn’t share any other instances of the n-word being used in the family. Though he does remind us where Woody Guthrie, the renowned folk singer who lived in a Trump-owned apartment in the 1950s, stood on the Trump race question. Guthrie’s song “Old Man Trump” features the lyrics: “I suppose that Old Man Trump knows just how much racial hate / He stirred up in that bloodpot of human hearts.”Just raising the question about Trump and race in the midst of a presidential campaign adds to a narrative that the former president’s detractors have repeated for years, in no small part because of the words he uses to describe people of color, particularly Latino migrants. An alleged instance of racist language used to describe African Americans — even one from decades ago — is the sort of thing that will draw interest at a time when the Democratic ticket’s support among Black voters had been slipping with Biden as the presumptive nominee and Trump’s, while still lagging far behind, had been improving.The author of “All in the Family” is the son of Donald Trump’s older brother, Fred Trump Jr., or “Freddie,” as he was known, who died in 1981 at the age of 42 after a life marred by alcoholism and unrealized dreams of a career as a commercial airline pilot. He is the second of Freddie’s children to write a book about the family. In 2020, his younger sister, Mary Trump — who holds a doctoral degree in clinical psychology — wrote a bestseller, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man.” (Mary’s next memoir, “Who Could Ever Love You,” is being published in September.)Putting out a book is a departure for Fred, one of the lesser-known members of the extended Trump family, who writes that he had been “stubbornly quiet, even as those around me took their potshots.” At times, “All in the Family” — which bogs down when the author’s life and real estate career are the subjects, but is pretty juicily entertaining when he writes about his aunts and uncles — reads like a cathartic exercise.Fred writes of engaging in an effort to try to understand the roots of Trumpian dysfunction so he can “move past all that stuff” inherent in having such a polarizing last name. He realizes, though, that his less-than-flattering portrait of the family — of his years of trying to maintain relationships with his difficult relatives — might make things “tense” the next time he runs into Uncle Donald on the golf course. Fred, who is the father of a son, William, with developmental disabilities, also writes that shedding his low profile is a way to leverage his famous name to advocate for people like William.In trying to puzzle out his complicated family, Fred, now 61, writes with some bemusement about his German immigrant great-grandfather, Friedrich Heinrich Trump, whom he dubs “Fred Zero,” sailing off to America in the late 1880s to avoid the military draft and eventually owning brothels in Alaska. He quips that Friedrich’s escape from military duty means that his Uncle Donald was not the first Trump to sidestep military service, a reference to Donald Trump avoiding the Vietnam War draft by dubiously claiming that he had bone spurs.While not as scathing as his sister Mary’s book, “All in the Family” still presents a dishy portrait of generations of the Trump family as chronically toxic, narcissistic, conniving and cruel. He attributes the roots of much of that to the environment created by his domineering grandfather, Fred Trump, the real estate magnate whose empire would eventually be headed by Uncle Donald. Many of the traits now so associated with the former president — the tendency to pit people against one another and braggadocio — appeared first in the family patriarch.“Everything that was ever done by anyone around him,” Fred writes about his grandfather, “he always figured he was the one who had really done it.”Fred lays no small amount of blame for his father’s troubles on his grandfather pushing him to join the family business. Though his father chafed at joining the business, according to his son, he was the one who came up with the idea of putting the Trump name on a large development — a decision his grandfather initially resisted. The airing of that fact is sure to rankle his Uncle Donald, who loves to take credit for almost everything and to present himself as a business savant.“Did my father create a monster with that branding suggestion of his?” Fred Trump writes. “Later, of course, his younger brother would run away with the idea. Before you knew it, we’d have Trump Tower, Trump University, Trump sneakers, and Trump Bibles.”A Trump family gathering sounds like it must have been a nightmare — almost as if they were in competition with each other to see who could be the meanest. One moment, Grandma Mary Anne would go ballistic because Fred showed up with Pepsi when she’d told him to bring Coke. Then Donald’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, would belittle Freddie’s wife, Linda, “with a special ruthlessness,” and in later years diss the family of Donald’s then-fiancée, Marla Maples.“They’re not simple,” Fred recalls Aunt Maryanne saying when the Maples family arrived for Donald’s and Marla’s wedding. “They’re simpletons.”And on and on it went.There really doesn’t seem to be any occasion, as Fred remembers it, when the Trumps couldn’t find reason to be cruel to others and themselves. The fight over his grandfather’s will has been well chronicled, but it’s the private conversations Fred recounts that seem so jarring. For those who don’t remember, Fred and Mary filed a lawsuit upon learning that they had been cut out of their father’s share of the family fortune after his grandfather’s death in 1999. The lawsuit, which was tabloid newspaper gold, was settled in 2001 for an undisclosed amount. But the mess leading up to that settlement was a fiasco Fred calls “the Trumpiest story ever.”During the legal fight, Fred got a call from his grandmother. She had a message for him: “I hope you die penniless just like your father did.”Fred concluded that the contretemps with the will was a money grab in which his Uncle Donald “manipulated” his grandfather to change his will to have more cash to stem his mounting debts from a string of failing businesses.“We were collateral damage of his selfish but typical scheme,” Fred writes.Now, at this point, it would seem to follow that Fred and Uncle Donald would be quits. Well, no, as it turns out. In the strange I-love-you, I-love-you-not universe of the Trump family, the story veers in another direction — sort of. A year after the lawsuit ended, Uncle Donald invited his nephew to be an honorary member of one of his golf clubs. They played a round together.In 2009, nephew Fred even turned to Uncle Donald for money. Indeed, we learn that Donald and his living siblings — Maryanne, Robert and Elizabeth — established a medical fund to help cover the costs of care and treatments for Fred’s son, who had been battling debilitating seizures.Nothing in this book offers a better insight into Donald Trump’s heart and mind — at least from the vantage point of his nephew — than the snatches of conversations about Fred’s son and about disabilities writ large. What comes through is a portrait of a man who sees himself as a superior being — right down to his DNA.It begins with that first conversation about the medical fund. Uncle Donald wanted to know something about his nephew’s son, Fred writes: “What’s the problem with him, anyway? Like what’s wrong with him?”When his nephew told him that the doctors didn’t really know, but that it’s “some kind of genetic thing,” Uncle Donald was taken aback.“Not in our family,” Fred recalls his uncle saying. “There’s nothing wrong with our genes.”What’s interesting, and somewhat unexpected, is that Uncle Donald — whom Fred had essentially accused of stealing from him and his sister — turns out to be the most generous contributor to the fund, the only sibling who consistently pumped money into it. And yet, Fred also remembers a moment of great cruelty when he once reached out about the costs of his son’s care. “I don’t know,” Uncle Donald told him. “He doesn’t recognize you. Maybe you should just let him die and move down to Florida.”Fred, who had always voted for Democrats, cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and for Biden in 2020, but he maintained contact with his uncle even after Biden won the election, including seeking help with his real estate career, because he said he was losing work due to having the last name Trump.Fred was not surprised when his uncle refused to accept the 2020 election results.“He couldn’t handle being called a loser,” Fred writes.But the nephew goes beyond that — not just labeling his uncle a sore loser, but also, in a sense, a coward. Uncle Donald had told the crowd that he’d join them to march on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, while Congress was preparing to certify the election results. But he didn’t do so, instead returning to the White House to watch as a violent, insurrectionist mob broke into the Capitol.It reminded Fred Trump of a story his Uncle Robert had told him: Uncle Donald was taunting a player he’d beaten in a golf game, and the man slugged him in the face.“That was the fight,” Fred writes. “A lot of tough talk, not too many punches.”Manuel Roig-Franzia is a Washington Post staff writer and The Post’s former bureau chief in Miami and Mexico City.The Trumps and How We Got This WayBy Fred C.

Battocletti, 35, agreed to plead guilty and repay the church, according to court documents.Her sentencing is set for November. The maximum penalty is 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.Public defenders listed for Battocletti did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. A message left at a phone number associated with her was not returned Wednesday morning.Battocletti stole the money from St. Francis of Assisi University Parish in Tuscaloosa while working as an administrative assistant there, according to federal court documents. She linked the church Mastercard to her Apple Pay account and then used it to make the purchases, including about $80,000 in personal expenses such as car insurance payments, the documents said.The rest of the spending was on TikTok coins, including nearly $70,000 in June 2023, about $105,000 in July and about $75,000 in August. Battocletti used the coins to send digital gifts to content creators, the U.S. attorney’s office said.The coins are a digital currency that viewers use to send virtual gifts to creators, which they can then cash in. “Gifts are virtual items you can send to show your appreciation for your favorite creators on TikTok,” the platform’s website says.Battocletti was responsible for the parish bookkeeping and had been employed there since 2018, said Donald Carson, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Birmingham.The money was taken gradually, but eventually others at the church began to notice that cash was missing, Carson said. “The loss began to add up, and that’s one of the triggers that got their attention,” Carson said.The pastor and the parish’s finance council discovered the unauthorized transactions when they investigated the missing funds. A diocese auditor confirmed the findings.“It’s tough when a member of your family, so to speak, makes decisions that are not in your best interest or in her own,” Carson said. “Our concern, at this point, is really to pray for her and her family, and her best outcome and recovery through all of this.”"
WaPo_29,Virginia football coach Tony Elliott knows this season must be better,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/tony-elliott-virginia-football-job-security/,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"CHARLOTTE — Virginia football coach Tony Elliott has said repeatedly that the best way to ensure long-term job security is to win. Since arriving in Charlottesville in 2022, though, Elliott has the fewest victories of any Cavaliers coach over his first two seasons in nearly 50 years.His brief résumé at Virginia includes six victories, falling short of his four immediate predecessors, each of whom directed four-win bumps from Year 1 to Year 2. Most recently, Bronco Mendenhall finished 6-7 in 2017 after beginning his six-year run with a 2-10 record the previous season.During ACC Football Kickoff, the league’s annual summer media event, Elliott acknowledged he is vividly aware of the need for marked improvement this season. He also indicated he has insulated himself from critics outside the locker room and the athletic department administration.“I don’t pay attention to it, to be honest with you, because then it would cripple me from taking the action I need to take,” Elliott said Tuesday afternoon, adding he has discussed the trajectory of the program extensively with Virginia Athletic Director Carla Williams but declining to reveal specifics from those conversations. “I know the constraints, the parameters, the opportunities for growth, the opportunities we missed within our program. I also know the challenges that we faced. . . .“The timetable of the people above me, I understand they may have that, but for me I’ve just got to focus on what I believe it takes day in and day out to get us to where we need to be based off of what’s in front of us.”The Cavaliers (3-9 in 2023) are coming off a season in which they lost five games by one possession, including four by three points or fewer. Their losses to North Carolina State, Boston College and Miami all were by a field goal. Virginia also dropped its second game of the season to visiting James Madison, 36-35.The plateau in wins through the first two years under Elliott has been particularly troubling to a swath of fans who point to the leap Virginia Tech, the Cavaliers’ contentious rival in the commonwealth, has made over the same span under Coach Brent Pry, who is also entering his third season.The Hokies finished 7-6 in 2023, capped by a 41-20 victory over Tulane in the Military Bowl in Annapolis. Their win total, including a 55-17 thumping of Virginia in Charlottesville in the regular season finale, was four more than in Pry’s first year.Virginia has beaten Virginia Tech once in the past 19 meetings for the Commonwealth Cup. Included in that downturn is a 15-game losing streak, the longest by either school in a series that dates to 1895.“I know it’s been talked about a lot, that we lost five games by seven points or less,” Cavaliers quarterback Tony Muskett said. “A big part of football is winning close games. Like I said, the experience factor, [almost] all those guys that played in those games are back now, so we’ve lived it. Take those things we learned and apply it to spring, winter and now summer to improve on it so that when it comes around this season, we’re ready to take those moments, capture it and win some games.”Even though Muskett was one of three players representing Virginia during the ACC’s media days, the graduate transfer remains part of an open competition at quarterback heading into the start of fall camp next week, according to Elliott. Also vying for the starting job is sophomore Anthony Colandrea.Muskett and Colandrea each started six games last season. Colandrea finished with 1,958 yards and 13 touchdowns with nine interceptions and a completion percentage of 62.6. Muskett, a native of Springfield, Va., threw for 1,031 yards and six touchdowns with five interceptions and a completion percentage of 63.3.Virginia opens the season Aug. 31 against Richmond at Scott Stadium. Its first ACC game is the following Saturday against Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, N.C.“That position gets a lot more scrutiny because typically you only play one,” Elliott said. “But for me, it was more on the front end just establishing what the expectation of the quarterback is within our system, right? Getting the guys to understand that and then creating an environment where they can have a healthy relationship to go compete, so they know I don’t have a prescribed [outcome]. I love them both. I believe in both of them, that we can win at the highest level with both of them.”"
WaPo_30,"Massive fires rage in Pacific Northwest and Canada, sending smoke south",https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/24/wildfires-canada-oregon-smoke-forecast/,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"Large wildfires in western Canada and the western United States have burned hundreds of thousands of acres over the past week, forcing thousands of people to evacuate, sending thick plumes of smoke southeastward and compromising air quality. Many of the fires have erupted from pinpoint lightning strikes amid record-breaking heat and expanding drought.Several massive blazes covering at least 100,000 acres are burning in Oregon and western Canada.With the smoke from the fires infiltrating the Rockies, air quality alerts were in effect Wednesday morning in most of eastern Colorado, including Denver; northern Wyoming, including Yellowstone National Park; and eastern Oregon. Much of western Canada is also under air quality alerts. Some smoke has even spread into the Midwest.Both Denver and Chicago have ranked among the top 10 most polluted large cities in the world since Tuesday, according to IQAir.com.Scorching temperatures have helped fuel the rapidly spreading fires. Temperatures have topped 100 degrees as far north as southern Canada, while California and other parts of the western United States are enduring their hottest 30-day stretch on record. Boise, Idaho, has reached at least 99 degrees on a record 16-straight days.Because of the number of fires and their size, both the United States and Canada have raised their scales signaling the need for firefighting resources to Level 5 out 5. In Canada, international crews from New Zealand and Australia have arrived to assist.As of Wednesday morning, 69 large wildfires were burning in the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.“Many wildfires in the Northwest area continue to have active to extreme fire behavior, with evacuation orders in effect on 15 fires,” the center wrote in a recent update. “Evacuation orders are also in effect for several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin.”In Canada, hundreds of fires have started in recent days.“National mobilization is heavily committed and increased measures need to be taken to support agencies,” the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center wrote in its latest situation report.The center warned that the potential for more fires is “high to extreme.”Big flare up of wildfires in Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta today. Several smoke plumes appear on visible satellite tonight. pic.twitter.com/8K5D1pYKgASome of the worst fires in western North America have been in Oregon, where a lengthy state of emergency was issued earlier in the month for the “risk of catastrophic wildfires.” The state is currently home to 31 large fires and the five largest in the Lower 48 states, ranging from 53,000 to nearly 240,000 acres as of late Tuesday.“Never seen 31 ‘large’ fires burning in Oregon at once and I’ve been doing this for three decades!” tweeted Mark Nelsen, a meteorologist for Portland affiliate KPTV.Only about a week old, the Durkee Fire in far-eastern Oregon was started by lightning and has rapidly consumed 240,000 acres. While it has mainly affected rural areas, some locations have been evacuated around the fire’s perimeter.The nearby Cow Valley Fire has also burned more than 133,000 acres.“This is really shaping up to be a monster fire year across the Pacific Northwest,” U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Holly Krake told Oregon Public Radio.To the south, California’s Lake Fire, which began north of Santa Barbara on July 5, has torched about 40,000 acres but recently came under nearly full containment, and evacuation orders have been lifted. A smaller blaze, started by fireworks Sunday, ran through a Riverside neighborhood in Southern California, burning down half a dozen homes.In western Canada, amid hundreds of wildfires burning, about 25,000 people were evacuated around Jasper National Park on Tuesday. While a majority of the blazes are in British Columbia and Alberta, significant fire activity is also occurring across central to northern Saskatchewan.The footprint of wildfire smoke over North America is quite substantial, spreading as far south as Mexico. In most spots, the smoke is at high altitudes and not close enough to the ground to affect air quality.However, the smoke is affecting air quality near the source of the fires and where atmospheric steering currents direct it.Across western Canada, the unhealthiest air is over the largely wilderness zone between Fort McMurray and Yellowknife. Poor air quality has also been a frequent issue in Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon and Regina.In the north-central United States, the smoke has caused the air quality index to reach Code Orange to even Code Red levels. Code Orange levels are considered unhealthy for sensitive groups, while Code Red is unhealthy for everyone.Parts of North Dakota had Code Red levels Tuesday, while much of the area from the High Plains toward Colorado witnessed Code Orange.While much of the smoke in North America is from Canada, fires in the Pacific Northwest and California are also contributing. Parts of eastern Oregon reached Code Purple levels for very unhealthy air early Wednesday.The 3.5 million acres burned by fires in the United States so far this year is about four times greater than last year at this time but around the average area over the last decade. California’s acreage burned is about twice the norm to date.Canada’s 5.7 million acres burned have already surpassed its annual average, following the record-setting season last year, when just shy of 43 million acres were lost.  While this year’s activity pales in comparison to last year’s, the number of acres burned is already higher than 11 of the last 20 years.My goodness...That's what the BC interior looks like after prolonged heat and numerous lightning events. 🌩️🔥 #bcfire In BC, there are now:- 428 active wildfires (and counting)- 266 of these (62%) are out of control- 119 started **in the last 24 hours** pic.twitter.com/CxpFuVpTe0Weather conducive to fires is expect to persist through at least Thursday in the Western United States, where high temperatures could reach at least 100 to 105 degrees, threatening records in some cases. On Wednesday, the fire threat is “critical” from eastern Oregon to southwestern Montana, according to the National Weather Service. Dry thunderstorms, producing lightning but little rain, could ignite new fires.After Friday, the Weather Service says, “the overall fire threat should lessen a bit.”In the longer term, weather outlooks suggest the fire risk will be above normal through at least September.In western Canada, conditions are improving somewhat as the heat has eased. A period of cooler and wetter weather could set up late this week and into next week, especially in northwestern Canada.The long-range outlook calls for a high to extreme risk of high fire activity in southwestern Canada through September, with somewhat lower risks to the north.Jason Samenow contributed to this report."
WaPo_31,"DOJ review blames Stone sentencing flip on poor leadership, not politics",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/24/roger-stone-sentencing-report-investigation-justice-department/,2024-07-25 01:00:19.122200,,"The Justice Department’s inspector general on Wednesday blamed “ineffectual leadership” and not political interference for the softening of Roger Stone’s sentencing recommendation in February 2020 after his conviction for lying to Congress. The report upheld an account by then-Attorney General William P. Barr but also found that line prosecutors’ suspicions of political meddling by President Donald Trump’s administration were not unreasonable.A longtime political confidant of Trump and a Republican consultant, Stone was found guilty by a jury in November 2019 of lying to a House panel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. At sentencing, front-line prosecutors initially notified the court that a sentence of about six to seven years would be appropriate under federal guidelines.Within hours of that filing, and after Trump tweeted that the request was “disgraceful” and a “miscarriage of justice” that could not be allowed, Barr overruled the trial team. A second memo signed by supervisors retracted the recommendation, prompting all four prosecutors to quit the case. Some of them later said publicly that they believed they were undercut by department leaders to protect Trump’s longtime ally.Stone was ultimately sentenced to a little more than three years behind bars, which Trump later commuted, sparing him prison time.The Stone sentencing triggered a crisis of confidence in Barr and the Justice Department through the end of Trump’s presidency, prompting hundreds of former employees to call for his resignation and to exhort active employees to report any unethical conduct or politicization of decisions.After a four-year investigation, the Office of Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said it found no evidence of political interference and instead blamed “ineffectual leadership” by Timothy J. Shea, then acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., who was supervising the case and who had been on the job for two weeks.Barr, who declined to be interviewed for the inspector general’s investigation, at the time denied that Trump’s Twitter tirade prompted the reversal. Instead, Barr said Shea — formerly one of his closest advisers at the department — had initially signaled to him that the recommendation would be much lower. Barr said he had been “very surprised” by the outcome.Horowitz’s office found that “rather than taking the approach he discussed with Barr, and despite telling Barr that he believed the Guidelines range was unreasonable,” Shea authorized line prosecutors to issue a stiffer recommendation. Barr expressed to staffers that the action was not what he and Shea had discussed and needed to be “fixed,” but the inspector general found that Barr’s position was consistent before and after the recommendation was filed and before Trump tweeted.“Based on the evidence described in this report, we concluded that the sequence of events that resulted in the Department’s extraordinary step of filing a second sentencing memorandum was largely due to Shea’s ineffectual leadership,” the report concluded.The report added, however, that prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky’s later testimony to Congress that he and the rest of the trial team had been pressured to revise the memorandum for political reasons “was not unreasonable.” It cited statements by another prosecutor and “speculative comments” by a supervising prosecutor about possible political interference.“We recognize that the Department’s handling of the sentencing in the Stone case was highly unusual,” given the participation of Trump political appointees Shea and Barr, the report stated. However, it concluded that absent any prohibition on their involvement, their actions were ultimately left up to their own “discretion and judgment,” including on how they would affect public perceptions of the department’s integrity and independence.Zelinsky attorney Joshua Matz said in a statement: “The rule of law depends on prosecutors pursuing and telling the truth. My client is gratified the report confirms that he told the truth about what he saw and heard.”Representatives for Shea, Barr and Trump could not immediately be reached for comment."

WaPo_33,Africanus Okokon’s inventive art enshrines the cast-offs of consumerism,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/24/touch-products-africanus-okokon/,2024-07-25 00:00:19.122200,,"Africanus Okokon’s “Touch Products,” the artist’s first major solo exhibition on view at Von Ammon Co. in Georgetown, is an ode to the artist’s past and present, stuffed with moments that create a lattice between African and Black American visual and vernacular culture. His show of video, collage and sculpture, named after a popular African cleaning product, crashes together objects invoking the artist’s roots, migratory patterns and colonial history, often through the grubby materials of consumer culture.Okokon is the child of immigrants from Nigeria and Ghana, the latter formerly called the Gold Coast by Europeans due to the abundant gold market that thrived there. That focus on cash and commerce is all over “Touch Products.”Okokon’s tactile manipulation of material is perhaps most evident in “The Breadwinner,” a large-scale collage made with repurposed discarded billboards from Accra. In it, a female figure is enrobed in vipers emitting currency, including American bills. She bears trays of money, her eyes closed. “The Breadwinner” is an homage to Okokon’s mother, and in this presentation, Okokon elevates her status to mythology. Layers of material unfurl around the figure, and the letters “aroma” float above her head like a halo. (Royal Aroma shaved rice, initially brought to Africa because European audiences did not want it, eventually became a delicacy and staple in West African cuisine — a site of meaning made out of necessity.)Through collage and digital manipulation, Okokon shows he knows who he is. This show invites you to see yourself and confront who you are.In its moments of Afrosurrealism, Okokon’s work calls up a kind of parallel world. In four repurposed Panasonic television screens, turned into prints with the venerable method of cyanotype photography, ghostly figures hover in blue expanses. The figures in the works are sourced from Ghanaian television and include megachurch ads, “concert party” narratives and coming-of-age tropes — cultural flotsam whose oceanic trappings evoke other ghosts trapped in the wake between the coast of Ghana, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. These found television screens, discarded and profane, are reclaimed and made sacred.“Heavenly Bodies” (2024) is a cross-section magnified of a television explosion of matter, stardust or static. “Flash of Light, or Darkness” is the final frame in this visual remix of African television, with clouds of pigment that reconcile a dark figure, seemingly about to step outside the screen and into the gallery.Another series of four prints depicts men with constellations of scars adorning their faces. The posters, with names like “Elite Cuts,” mimic familiar barbershop posters commonly found in Black barbershops across the country. In “The Fine Cut” (2024), embossed and debossed silk screen on paper with floating acrylic, four men are depicted in a wash of blue pigment. Okokon uses beads as a form of Braille and communication. The artist used the technique of intaglio collotype, and by layering wires and beads under the poster, he creates an effect that mimics African scarification.The screen prints are inspired by posters that Okokon sourced in Accra. He brought them to the United States and then swapped out the African models with African American models from a barbershop poster in Atlanta — an Afropolitan exchange underlining Okokon’s hybrid approach to form and meaning.With “Touch Products,” Okokon taps into the collective memory of diasporic culture, which includes a sense of repurposing and recollection across time and space.That includes painful memories: The Gold Coast was also where enslaved people were stripped of their history and transported to the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. Okokon recalls this legacy in a presentation of four assemblage sculptures set in found 19th-century chests from Ghana. The sculptures embedded within each chest are interpolations of traditional Akan casts, American basketball trophies and wood carvings created in Ghana in dialogue with Ghanaian artists.In “Nsibidi Loops (Plenty Money)” (2024), Okokon has placed two screens into one of these sea chests. On one monitor, the artist has animated pictograms from the Nsibidi writing system; on the other, he has mixed found TV footage, AI-generated voice, pop music, digital animation and sound to translate them, in a brilliant, meme-ified mash-up of the Nollywood Y2K aesthetic.“Touch Products” is a debut exhibition that arrests the viewer with its magnanimity and urgency. Okokon’s odes to consumer culture also ask what is most precious to us. What will our relics and reliquaries be at the end of this Earth? It is a rumination on ancestry and legacy, in which the artist’s upcycling of materials creates monuments to his homeland and invites viewers to consider their own mortality and connection to this dying Earth.3330 Cady’s Alley NW. 202-893-9797.Dates: Through Aug. 18.Prices: Free."
WaPo_34,A shark-bitten surfer’s leg washed ashore. Doctors hope to reattach it.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/surfer-shark-attack-leg-australia/,2024-07-25 00:00:19.122200,,"Shortly after a shark attacked a surfer in Australia on Tuesday, the surfer’s severed leg washed ashore. Now the race is on to see if surgeons can reattach it.Kai McKenzie, 23, was attacked by a nearly 10-foot great white shark as he surfed near Port Macquarie, a small town about 250 miles from Sydney, in New South Wales. He fought off the attack and a wave carried him to shore, where an off-duty police officer stemmed the bleeding by improvising a tourniquet with a dog’s leash, according to authorities. Shortly afterward, McKenzie’s right leg washed up on the beach and was placed on ice for transporting to the hospital. It was not immediately known whether his leg was saved.McKenzie is in serious condition, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, and the quick response by an off-duty officer’s save McKenzie’s life and any chance that the leg could be reattached.“He used the lead off his dog as a tourniquet … and essentially saved his life until the paramedics got there,” said Kirran Mowbray, NSW Ambulance Service Hastings South duty manager. He described McKenzie as “able to talk” and “calm” after the attack. “He’s just a really brave and courageous young man.”He and his leg were flown from a hospital to John Hunter Hospital, a major trauma center 124 miles away in Newcastle. Rage, a surfwear company that sponsors McKenzie, noted on Instagram that he had begun surfing again seven months ago after fracturing his neck.“Sending love to @kai_mckenzie the youngest RAGE boy on the team and the toughest person that we know,” the company wrote in Instagram. “Yesterday he was attacked by a shark and has lost his leg while surfing in Port Macquarie. He has been through a lot breaking his [neck] last year, he never once complained always just got on with doing what he loved as soon as possible. He is an inspiring person. The whole rage gang loves you man and we will see you soon.”A post shared by RAGE (@ragetm)Authorities were trying to find the shark using drones and a type of trap to catch it without killing it, NSW Police Chief Inspector Stuart Campbell told Sydney’s 7News. Over the past week, 15 white sharks have been detected in Port Macquarie on the tagged shark listening system, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development told Nine News.A GoFundMe account was set up by a neighbor to help McKenzie and his family with medical costs.Tweed Heads board shaper Luke Short, whose boards McKenzie has been riding for five years, told Nine News that McKenzie has a job installing crematoriums and paints and plays music while also “trying to make a bit of a career with his surfing and skating.”He added, “I’m sure he doesn’t realize it, but he’s got a lot of people who care about him.”"
WaPo_35,William & Mary lands $100 million gift to expand marine sciences school,https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/07/24/william-mary-coastal-marine-sciences/,2024-07-24 23:00:19.122200,,"William & Mary will expand its coastal and marine sciences research with the help of a $100 million donation from local philanthropist Jane Batten. The university announced its largest donation in its 331-year history Wednesday.The donation toward the newly-named Batten School of Coastal and Marine Sciences will support William & Mary’s existing marine science program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. With the donation, the university will establish a Bachelor of Science degree in marine science, the first of its kind at a public university in Virginia, university officials confirmed.The Batten School will be located along the York River in Gloucester Point, Va., nearly 20 miles from William & Mary’s main campus in Williamsburg. The school is surrounded by wetlands, marshes and coastal waters.Katherine Rowe, president of William & Mary, described the gift as a forward-looking investment in coastal and marine sciences.“It’s becoming fairly well understood that every part of human life is affected by threats to our coastlines, our communities and cultures, transportation, national security and food supply.” Rowe said. “This is the time when we need to think about what it’s going to take to be resilient in the face of storm surges and floods and erosion.”Batten said she and Rowe have talked about a potential gift for five years. Batten said she is confident her donation will enable William & Mary to expand on marine sciences research already in place.“There’s just such a high level [of interest] among young people in environmental issues across all disciplines, and this helps educate a whole new army of young people to go out and attack this very critical problem,” Batten said.William & Mary has long partnered with VIMS, one of the largest marine research and education centers in the nation. The state agency was established in 1940 and fully integrated with William & Mary in 1979. VIMS’s graduate students can specialize in coastal and ocean processes, ecosystem health and natural resources. The school has granted over 1,000 graduate degrees since the integration.Education in coastal and marine research is a priority to William & Mary, Rowe said, especially in a state where nearly 5 million people live near coastlines. Derek Aday, director of VIMS, said the school aims to find a solution for ongoing flooding, sea-level rises and water quality issues in coastal communities around the world.“When you combine the resources of Mrs. Batten, with the research expertise, and the history of the great work and the partnership between VIMS, and William & Mary, you get the supercharged opportunity to do work on truly existential issues that face the lives of a big portion of the world’s population,” Aday said.A portion of the donation will directly support students through scholarships, fellowships, internships and funding for research equipment, Aday said.William & Mary currently offers graduate and doctoral degree programs in marine sciences. With the new gift, it plans to admit undergraduate marine science students starting in the fall of 2025.Aday said officials want to create a “bachelor’s program that will deliver the ability to do not just the great educational experience, but the hands-on research, outreach and engagement experience that many students are looking for.”Batten’s donation matches a trend of large philanthropic gifts increasing over the years, said Sue Cunningham, president and CEO of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. In February, CASE reported $58 billion was given to U.S. colleges and universities in the 2023 fiscal year.“Over the years, we have seen significant growth with 11 gifts in 2023 of $100 million or more,” Cunningham said. “That’s double that was in 2022 and they represent 3.9 percent of total support.”In the last 15 years, Batten said she has dedicated her philanthropy around environmental education.The Batten name is quite familiar to the William & Mary community. Jane Batten’s late husband Frank Batten Sr. served on the university’s board of visitors in the 1990s. Jane Batten received an honorary degree from William & Mary in 2017. The family also established the Batten Foundation Scholarship Endowment at the Raymond A. Mason School of Business, the Frank Batten Sr. MBA Investment Fund Endowment, and the business school’s Center for Online Learning.The family also contributed to other Virginia universities. For example, in 2007, Frank Batten Sr. donated $100 million to the University of Virginia to create a school of leadership and public policy.“The Batten family has a profound reputation,” Rowe said. “They’re extraordinary and visionary donors in our region and they think across generations. In this partnership with them, we’re leaning into one of the most critical areas for any future community.”At 87, Jane Batten remains active in several local foundations, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Hampton Roads Community Foundation. She said she hopes her gift will inspire others to invest in the education of coastal and marine sciences across the nation.“There have not been many other large gifts for the environment, to institutions [of higher education] in this country,” Batten said. “I’m hoping that this will wake people up. Instead of giving … where other big gifts normally go, they will give gifts to institutions for this purpose.”"
WaPo_36,Gerald Ford predicted a female U.S. president – if a male one died,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/24/gerald-ford-female-president-video/,2024-07-24 23:00:19.122200,,"Nearly 35 years ago, former president Gerald Ford stood in a room full of schoolchildren in West Branch, Iowa, and faced an unexpected question.“Mr. Ford, what advice would you give a young lady wanting to become president of the United States of America?” a bespectacled schoolgirl in a pink sweater and ponytail asked Ford in 1989, well after his own presidency ended.He chuckled.“I can tell you how I think it will happen — because it won’t happen in the normal course of events,” said Ford, who succeeded Richard M. Nixon when he resigned in 1974 in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal.Ford went on to detail a scenario where a female vice president would reach the Oval Office — if the male president died.“Either the Republican or Democrat political party will nominate a man for president and a woman for vice president, and the woman and man will win. So we’ll end up with a president, a male, and a vice president, a female,” Ford said.“And in that term of office of the president, the president will die, and the woman will become president under the law, our Constitution,” he added.The video is resurfacing on social media, with many noting the parallels between Ford’s prediction and 2024 — as Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who is rallying a groundswell of support from her party and is likely to be the Democratic nominee.At the same time, there are key differences. A woman has indeed secured the nomination of a major party — in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination, though she lost the election to Donald Trump. And of course Biden is still very much alive.Ford also said he could probably see a female president — at least under the conditions he outlined — happening in the next four to eight years. More than three decades later, there still hasn’t been a female president.Given the specifics of the prediction Ford laid out, it’s worth a reminder, too, that Ford himself is the only American to become president without winning a general election for president or vice president. He won the Republican nomination in 1976 but lost the election.A few years before Ford spoke at the event in Iowa, Democrat Geraldine Ferraro made history in the 1984 presidential election as she became the first woman to be nominated as vice president by a major party. She served as the running mate for Walter Mondale, who lost to President Ronald Reagan.The next female vice-presidential nominee would come decades later in 2008, when John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate but lost to Barack Obama.In 2021, Harris became the first female vice president of the United States.Ford predicted that once a woman ultimately did become president, men would struggle in the competition for the top job. “Once that barrier is broken, from then on, men better be careful because they’ll have a hard, hard time ever even getting a nomination in the future,” he said."

I’ll do anything,” says the Portland, Ore.-based guitarist/singer and now sole member of Reyna Tropical. The love from sold-out West Coast audiences on her current tour, which stops at Songbyrd on July 31, has been palpable, Reyna says, describing it as feeling like she’s being “held” by the crowd.Fans know that Reyna needs extra love this time around. Reyna’s musical partner and producer, Nectali “Sumohair” Díaz, died in an accident in 2022. Reyna and Díaz, both born in Mexico but raised mostly in the United States, created a sound inspired by Mexican, Colombian, Peruvian and Congolese rhythms. They released two EPs of tropical-sounding music centered on themes of queer love, diasporic melancholy and connection to the land.After Díaz’s death, Reyna chose to keep working on Reyna Tropical. But after unsuccessful attempts at using the music she started with Díaz to make a complete project, Reyna realized the only way forward was to somehow combine it with her solo music. It wasn’t easy emotionally.“I just had so many insecurities about what I was capable of, because that’s what grief does. It strips you of your identity because you’re growing into someone else and they stay the same,” Reyna says via Zoom from Portland. Musically, however, merging the music was so seamless that it felt meant to be. “It all came together like magic,” she says.That magic birthed her new album, “Malegría,” a Spanish word that roughly translates to “bittersweet” as it combines the words “mal” (bad) and “alegría” (happiness). The album, released in March, features foot-tapping percussion inspired by Latin American Indigenous populations, sounds taken from nature, and Reyna’s often hypnotizing guitar riffs. On “Cartagena,” Reyna sings against upbeat percussion about finding herself in nature: “Ay, que me cargue la corriente/ Que me acaricie el ambiente (Oh, let the current charge me/ Let the environment caress me).”Although the album is sung entirely in Spanish, it is sprinkled with English interludes that are snippets of recorded conversations between Reyna and Díaz. “I wanted Sumo’s voice to live on in the way I heard it,” Reyna says.In an interlude titled “Queer Love & Afro-Mexico,” Díaz’s voice is layered atop what sound like waves gently washing over a shore. “I feel like now that we’ve reached this point, for us to come together and make music, it’s music with purpose,” he says as his voice echoes into forever.July 31 at 8 p.m. at Songbyrd, 540 Penn St. NE. songbyrddc.com. $15-$20."
WaPo_39,"1972 Munich Olympics, marred by killing of Israeli athletes, loom over Paris Games",https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/07/24/olympics-munich-israel-1972-paris/,2024-07-24 23:00:19.122200,,"The 1972 Munich Olympics were viewed by their German hosts as a chance to leave the country’s history behind. Instead, the Games became notorious for terrorism after an attack on the Israeli team by Palestinian militants that left 12 victims dead, as well as five attackers.That history now looms over the 2024 Paris Olympics, which begin this weekend amid the global fallout from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas and the war in Gaza that Palestinian authorities say has killed 39,000 people. Israeli athletes have reported receiving threats that directly allude to a reprise of the Munich Olympics, according to Israeli news outlets, while France has pledged tighter security for the 88-athlete Israeli delegation.The attack on Israeli athletes and coaches in Munich more than half a century ago sparked an international crisis. That crisis continues to reverberate, with Germany agreeing in 2022 to pay 28 million euros ($29.5 million) to the families of the 11 slain Israelis (a German police officer was also among those killed). For decades, the families contended that Germany had not done enough to protect the Israeli team.Munich had sought the Games in a bid to change Germany’s global reputation. No German city had hosted them since 1936, when Adolf Hitler used the international stage afforded by the Berlin Olympics to promote Nazi propaganda.Although World War II had long ended, the Berlin Wall would not fall for 17 more years. The divided nation was eager to shed the Nazi memory that continued to dominate the country’s global profile, so West Germany hoped to project an image of happiness and unity, both to spectators in the Munich stands and audience members tuning in on television.That image came crashing down in the early hours of Sept. 5, 1972, when eight Palestinian militants from the group Black September stormed the Olympic Village dorm of the 11 Israelis.Black September leaders had hoped to use the international viewership of the Olympics — the same television audience that West Germany itself sought — to bring global attention to the plight of Palestinians.The attack came just five years after the 1967 Middle East war. In that conflict, often referred to as the Six-Day War, Israel seized control of the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem, while Arab armies bore massive losses.The eight militants killed two of the Israelis immediately. They took the nine others, who were handcuffed and beaten, as hostages. Black September demanded the release of more than 200 political prisoners from Israel, West Germany and other nations; if the countries failed to release the prisoners, they said, they would kill one hostage an hour until the demands were met.The United States quickly pulled swimmer Mark Spitz — who had won seven gold medals, a record that would remain unbroken until Michael Phelps’s eight in the 2008 Beijing Olympics — out of the Olympic Village, worried that he, as a prominent Jewish American, would also be targeted.Germany tried to rescue the kidnapped Israelis for 20 hours, but was repeatedly thwarted. As negotiations stalled, the Black September members demanded an airplane that night to fly the nine hostages to an Arab nation.German officials tried to trap the extremists. They planned to send five snipers to a German air force base outside Munich and staff the Lufthansa airplane with police officers, charged with defeating the group and rescuing the hostages. By West German law, the army was barred from involving itself in what was deemed a civil affair — so the burden fell on 14 local police officers who lacked experience in counterterrorism.But the officer in charge considered the operation to be a suicide mission, Munich police officer Guido Schlosser told The Post in 2022, and proposed abandoning the plan. The plane was empty when the militants boarded.Black September and its hostages arrived at the air base via helicopters. But when the militants boarded the plane, they realized it was a trap. As the German snipers opened fire, the Palestinian militants hurled grenades at the helicopters. One German police officer, the nine Israeli hostages and five of the Palestinian militants were killed. The three other members of Black September were arrested.In the years that followed the tragedy, the Israelis’ families accused Germany of botching its response to the attack and failing to save lives.It was later discovered that before the attack, German officials had received a warning of potential action by Palestinian militants. But amid a desire to promote an image of peace and unity, they decided to station unarmed security officers at Olympic venues, instead of armed police officers.After Black September killed two Israelis and took the nine hostages, West Germany contacted Israeli officials — who were more experienced at negotiating with terrorists — but ultimately turned down their offers of help. The police officers who abandoned the plane were young and inexperienced, and they were not equipped to handle an attack of this magnitude.The 1972 Olympics have remained a painful memory for many people over the past 52 years, as shown by reactions last week to an Adidas promotional campaign.The sportswear and sneakers company launched advertisements to re-promote its SL72 shoes — a pair of trainers first introduced to coincide with the 1972 Games. But the campaign faced almost immediate backlash as consumers and brand ambassadors alike accused Adidas of highlighting the violence that racked the Munich Olympics.Meanwhile, the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the war in Gaza have contributed to a tense political atmosphere surrounding this year’s Olympics, with calls from the Palestinian Olympic Committee and others to ban Israeli athletes from the Games.Israeli news outlets have reported that the country’s athletes have received threatening messages by email and phone over the past week. Messages sent from “the People’s Defense Organization” to 15 athletes said the group aims “to repeat the events of Munich 1972,” the Times of Israel reported, and some athletes have received invitations to their own funerals.A video circulating on social media Tuesday afternoon showed an individual, whose face is concealed by a kaffiyeh, addressing France and French President Emmanuel Macron in Arabic and making threats against Paris. At the end of the minute-long message, the speaker holds up what appears to be a plastic bloodied head.“You supported the zionist regime in its criminal war against the people of Palestine,” read subtitles on the video, which is in Arabic. The Washington Post could not confirm the origin of the video or its veracity.France plans to deploy 35,000 police officers each day of the Games, with 45,000 on duty during the Opening Ceremonies. The security plan also includes surveillance flights and drones, fighter jets, and helicopters carrying sharpshooters, the Associated Press reported. The effort is supported by more than 40 countries that have jointly sent at least 1,900 officers as reinforcements, including from the Los Angeles Police Department.According to French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, France has banned nearly 4,000 people from attending Olympic events based on the results of extensive background checks, including individuals espousing extreme right- or left-wing ideologies and suspected Islamist extremists. He added that authorities are also paying close attention to Russian and Belarusian citizens.Paris has a history of terrorist attacks, most recently in 2015, when shootings and bombings by Islamic State attackers in six locations across the French capital killed at least 130 people and wounded more than 350.In May, Darmanin said an 18-year-old man had been arrested in the French town of Saint-Étienne for allegedly planning an attack on the Olympics in the name of the Islamic State, Reuters reported. Darmanin said the alleged plot was the first known to have targeted the Games."

And while they worked to tip the scales toward playfulness and spontaneity, the duo weren’t afraid to play up the contrast, recalling a quote by famed Argentine chef Francis Mallmann.“A journalist asked him, ‘What is the perfect wine pairing for this type of dish?’ And he said, ‘I’m bored with the idea of pairing. I like when things fight for attention, and I prefer a wine that doesn’t match with what we’re eating, but something that struggles a bit with the food,’” de Rosnay related over Zoom.On “Hyperdrama,” released in April, Justice leaned into that type of sensory clash as a way to update a blend of disco and electronic music that is “old news” anyway, de Rosnay said. The result is an album full of block-rocking beats, including the robotic stomp of “One Night/All Night” and the saw-toothed angst of “Generator.” But there are also moments of disco dream weaving on such songs as “Neverender” and “Saturnine,” which feature the vocals of Tame Impala and Miguel, respectively.In concert, Augé and de Rosnay balance a similar dichotomy as both conductors and players, managing the build and release of sonic-kinetic energy like DJs while augmenting recorded tracks with live bass lines, chords and solos.“We know exactly what we need to activate on what path just to give it this energy and dynamic tension in those parts,” de Rosnay said.A Justice show is a clockwork contraption mixing the duo’s musicianship and the offstage operators who make the audiovisual disco possible. That doesn’t give much room for improvisation, but does allow them to try to deliver the best possible experience every night.“We know how to improve every part,” de Rosnay said, “and now we’re really entering the phase where we’re trying to execute it as precisely as possible.”July 28 at 8 p.m. at the Anthem, 901 Wharf St. SW. theanthemdc.com.

WaPo_42,Your flight is stuck on the tarmac. What do airlines owe you?,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/flight-delays-tarmac-vouchers-credits-refunds/,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"U.S. airports fell into chaos last week as a CrowdStrike outage led approximately 46,000 flights to be canceled worldwide. Thousands of Delta flights continue to be affected, provoking a Department of Transportation investigation and adding to what already was a summer of flight delays.But while delays often are miserable, they can be even more so when you’re waiting on the tarmac, as some of the outage-affected passengers said they were. It doesn’t help that, in a summer of extreme and dangerous heat, planes can’t cool cabins on the ground as well as they can in the sky.If your flight is stuck on the tarmac past a certain point, airlines may owe you. But there’s a catch.The protections for U.S. airline passengers are “rudimentary” compared to in Europe, said Eric Napoli, the chief legal officer at claims management company AirHelp. “The best you’re going to get is what airlines want to offer you in the terms and conditions you have for that airline.”You’ll have to advocate for yourself.Tarmac delays have shortened significantly since the Transportation Department established customer-protection rules for delays, said William McGee, a senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project. But some tarmac stops still can drag maddeningly on.Depending on how long you’re stuck on the tarmac, airlines in the United States have certain obligations.Per Department of Transportation rules, at the two-hour mark, airlines must provide their passengers with food, water, “comfortable” cabin temperatures, access to functioning toilets and medical assistance, if needed. After that — before three hours on the tarmac for domestic flights, and before four for international flights — an aircraft must provide customers the option to deplane. The exception to this rule, Napoli said, is if a safety issue is preventing the plane from returning to the gate.The same tarmac rules apply for arriving planes. If travelers are not provided with these essential provisions, Napoli recommends filing a complaint with the airline as soon as possible.Some airlines that provide food, hotel or transportation vouchers or flight credits for other sorts of delays would provide the same for a tarmac delay, as long as it falls within their specific guidelines.To find your airline’s policies, check the Transportation Department’s Airline Cancellation and Delay Dashboard, which compiles compensation and rights information from 10 U.S. carriers. The dashboard lists which airlines give a travel credit or voucher when delays last more than three hours (JetBlue, Southwest and Alaska) and which provide hotel accommodation and transportation in the case of significant delays (all but Frontier). The Transportation Department does not define “significant delays” worthy of refunding, however, so travelers who believe they’re eligible must file a complaint with their airline on a case-by-case basis.McGee also recommended that passengers download their airline’s contract of carriage, documents that serve as contracts between U.S. airlines and their passengers. Contracts of carriage can be difficult to understand, but knowing your rights helps you appeal for what you deserve.“You have to do a little homework. I wish I could say it was easy … but it’s not, in the United States,” McGee said.Regardless of the problem, whether delay or cancellation, contact airline customer service quickly. Especially during mass disruptions like the CrowdStrike outage, beating the rush to ask for help can be the difference between getting timely help and waiting hours or days for a response.The best way to reach customer service, experts say, is in person or over the phone. Talking to a real person — even if it requires a long hold time — means you can more directly insist upon your rights, rather than argue with a chatbot."
WaPo_43,CrowdStrike blames global IT outage on bug in checking updates,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/24/crowdstrike-microsoft-crash-bug-report/,2024-07-25 04:01:19.122200,,"A faulty software update that crashed Windows computers around the world, upending air travel and hospital care, was caused by a bug in cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike’s quality-control system and inadequate testing systems, the company said Wednesday.In a preliminary review, the Texas-based company said a program for validating updates missed “problematic content” in what was supposed to be a minor adjustment to CrowdStrike software previously installed on more than 8 million machines.The bad data triggered a memory problem that “could not be gracefully handled,” causing some Windows operating systems to crash and display the light-blue, full-screen warning known as the Blue Screen of Death, according to CrowdStrike’s report.The report failed to impress some security experts who said they were appalled to learn that CrowdStrike had not first deployed the update to a full-fledged computer running Windows and then rolled it out gradually, so that any mistake would have been detected before it disabled computers around the world.CrowdStrike said it would improve testing in the future, stagger distribution and give customers control over whether small updates are installed immediately.The new disclosures came as some damage estimates for lost revenue ran over $1 billion, which would put Friday’s incident among the most costly outages, even though it didn’t lead to the permanent deletion of data or destruction of computers.Parametrix Insurance, which provides data on availability of technology services and covers losses from cloud computing outages, predicted that Fortune 500 companies would lose more than $5 billion from the CrowdStrike failure. The company said airlines would prove to have been hit the worst and that 80 percent or more of the overall losses would not be covered by insurance.The disaster renewed calls for greater accountability from software companies, which are generally held to be immune from product liability lawsuits because software is licensed instead of sold. They can still be sued for negligence, but that approach is typically limited by the licensing agreement.CrowdStrike’s general agreement says that an outage entitles customers to a refund for the CrowdStrike subscription costs only on those days and that it is not responsible for any lost profit, revenue or business opportunity.Such commonplace clauses “protect developers from bearing the full brunt of the damages their products might cause,” said Brian Fox, chief technology officer of Sonatype, which helps companies manage their software supply chains. “This legal framework, while designed to protect innovation, has also led to a lack of accountability.”Biden administration officials have been pushing software vendors to voluntarily adopt safer coding practices and are requiring better service when the government buys their products. But restrictions on which misdeeds can be absolved by licensing contracts might need action in Congress.“The feds and big buyers need to be more active in mandating [vendor] diversity and resiliency. Those things will never happen on their own,” said Amit Yoran, a former top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security who is chief executive of security firm Tenable.Although most businesses saw their operations return to normal over the weekend, some ripple effects continued to be felt this week, with one major airline, Delta, still canceling flights Tuesday. Other customers were down Wednesday.The company pledged to publish a more in-depth report on what went wrong once its full investigation is complete.“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” CrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz said in a statement.CrowdStrike is widely used by government agencies and large companies, which deploy its Falcon sensors to employee machines. Like other security platforms, it attaches deeply within the Windows operating system, giving it greater power to thwart innovative hackers and greater ability to trigger a full computer failure.After its founding in 2011, CrowdStrike became known for its involvement in post-mortem investigations into several high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack by North Korea and Russian hacks of top Democratic Party officials in 2016. It attracted investment from Google and went public in 2019."
WaPo_44,"Refrigerating produce in jars looks great, but it can breed bacteria",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/07/24/produce-storage-glass-jars-avocados-carrots/,2024-07-24 22:00:19.122200,,"You’ve probably seen them: Images of clear glass canning jars filled with multicolored berries that look like little jewels. Asparagus stalks, plunked into a glass-turned-vase that doubles as a charming centerpiece.Social media is awash with food-in-jars storage hacks that are a joy to ogle — but do they translate to real-life solutions? I asked produce and food safety researchers and experimented in my own kitchen to learn which of these storage tricks are worth it and which are recipes for things you really don’t want to eat.Spoiler alert: While water soaks and vase treatments can perk up produce, experts said to beware of water submersion hacks promising weeks of shelf life — that invites microbial growth. Be careful with tightly sealed jars, they warned, which can suffocate living, breathing fresh fruits and vegetables. And remember that every type of produce has different needs and quirks, and every piece of produce has a unique history that could be the difference between quickly going fuzzy or staying pristine for a month. A hack that works this week could easily turn to mush next week.The best thing you can do to extend the life of most fresh fruits and vegetables is to get them into the fridge as fast as possible, said Elizabeth Mitcham, emeritus director of the Postharvest Technology Center at the University of California, Davis.“If you go to the farmers market and you buy produce, and then you wander around for a few hours, and then you finally get home and then put them in the fridge, you’ve already lost way more of the life of that product” than you’d gain from any special storage tricks, she said, especially on a warm day.After keeping produce cool, there’s a delicate dance between storing it in ways that enable it to breathe, but retain moisture, among other factors (including that some whole fruits and vegetables don’t do well in the fridge). The crisper drawer is designed to help with this, but it’s a tough puzzle, which explains why we’re so hungry for hacks.So here’s what to know about some popular produce storage tricks:The hack: Store celery and carrot sticks in a water-filled jar.The takeaway: Use this trick to keep veggie sticks attractive and crunchy, but not to stretch shelf life.In the short term, water submersion keeps celery and carrots crisp by preventing dry air from sucking moisture from their cells. It also prevents dried-out, white patches on cut or peeled carrots. Ben Chapman, director of a food safety research program at North Carolina State University, said a couple days or a week could be fine, but once weeks go by the water could help a small amount of bacterial contamination go from, say, a tiny corner of one celery stick to growing all over the sticks.Chapman, who analyzed this scenario on “Risky or Not,” a podcast he co-hosts, said his top concern was listeria monocytogenes, a type of human pathogen with the unusual ability to grow in the fridge. In small amounts, it rarely sickens healthy adults, but it becomes more problematic, especially for immunocompromised or pregnant people, once it’s had time to proliferate. If your fridge rises above the recommended 41-degree Fahrenheit maximum, he said, listeria grows faster. Other types of harmful bacteria, as well as bacteria that simply spoil your food, also grow more easily in warmer fridges. After weeks in a too-warm fridge, you could have quite the petri dish, or, jar, of veggie sticks.One plot twist, noted Don Schaffner, a Rutgers University food microbiologist and Chapman’s podcast co-host: While carrots aren’t immune to microbial growth, there’s evidence they have an unusual ability to inhibit listeria growth. He worries more about celery stored underwater.The hack: Submerge ripe, skin-on avocados in a jug of water and stash in the fridge to extend their life.The takeaway: Do not submerge avocados in water. Instead, put them in the fridge once they’re ripe to keep them at their peak for a few more days.Avocados need to ripen at room temperature, but once ripened, the fridge’s chill keeps them at their peak longer. If you halve the avocados first, water will slow oxidation, so they’ll appear good for longer.But don’t do this. Over time the water can facilitate dangerous bacterial growth, even if the avocado looks great.U.S. Food and Drug Administration sampling has found listeria on avocado peels, and while you should always wash your produce, a good cleaning can’t remove all bacteria. Additionally, an agency spokesperson told me, when FDA scientists stored whole avocados in refrigerated tanks for 15 days, they found listeria moved from the peel into the green flesh.The hack: Store asparagus like flowers, in a “vase” in the fridge.The takeaway: Trim the bottoms of asparagus stalks and stand them upright in a glass with water to keep them firm for a few days. Don’t leave them in water for an extended period of time.This mirrors an industry practice of packing asparagus upright, with a wet pad at the bottom, said Mark Ritenour, a postharvest biologist at the University of Florida. The moisture fuels their thirsty, growing tissue and prevents shriveling.If you create an “asparagus vase” at home, Ritenour suggests using a minimal amount of water for only a few days, citing, you guessed it, concerns about microbes flourishing in the water. He also advises cutting off the wet ends before prepping them.So, I tried this. I split a bunch of asparagus in half, putting one handful in a glass with some water (which looked delightful in my fridge) and the other in a cotton bag in my crisper drawer. After several days, both bunches looked the same, maybe the vase stalks were a little firmer. Both sets roasted up nicely, so for me, for that bunch, it was not worth the time. Ritenour said it’s possible my set up kept just enough moisture in, and noted that my experience speaks to the endless variability with produce.The hack: Put berries in a sealed glass jar and stash it in the fridge.The takeaway: Do not store fresh berries in a sealed jar to extend their life. Instead, leave them in the clamshell container and put them in the crisper drawer of your fridge; or place them in a storage container lined with paper towels and leave the lid ajar. This will preserve some moisture while also allowing gas exchange. (For extended storage: Wash, dry and freeze them.)A sealed jar traps humidity, keeping berries plump. But many factors, including how often you open the jar, will impact how they fare.Even harvested produce takes in oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, just like we do. (This is separate from the plant kingdom’s more famous trick, photosynthesis, which, among other things, takes in carbon dioxide and gives off oxygen.) Different types of produce respire at different rates — respiration rate is a huge factor in determining shelf life — and delicate berries respire fast. Left in a sealed jar for too long, they’ll deplete oxygen and switch to anaerobic respiration, which churns out off flavors and eventually makes the berries fall apart, scientists explained to me.I tried this method myself, leaving jars of berries tightly sealed while I was away for more than a week. When I came home, the jars’ inner walls dripped with condensation. The strawberries smelled of chemicals, and I had no interest in eating them. They were, however, more plump than the berries I left in the clamshell and showed no visible mold, so there’s that.Another concern: As fresh produce’s respiration depletes oxygen in a sealed jar, it could create an environment that’s ideal for certain bacteria. In this case, berries’ acidity could mitigate pathogen growth, said Schaffner, the Rutgers food microbiologist, but not enough to dispel food safety concerns.“Generally I think it's a bad idea to store foods for extended periods of time, especially under anaerobic conditions,” he wrote in an email.If you’re wondering how to square all this with the sealed bags and tubs of produce sold at grocery stores, Eva Almenar, a professor at the Michigan State University School of Packaging who specializes in produce packaging, noted that those are made with plastics that allow gas exchange.But forget respiration for a moment. The risks of pouring delicate berries into a jar was enough to give Ritenour pause. “Whenever you're touching the berries or moving the berries, you're giving an opportunity for damage and the introduction or movement of potential decay organisms,” he said.Ultimately, Ritenour said, don’t expect your produce to last forever. As long as you’re following best practices, if putting your fruits and veggies in a clear, pretty container makes them more enticing and gets them on your plate faster, maybe that’s the “hack” you need.Rachael Jackson is a D.C.-based writer and the founder of EatOrToss.com.

Killing a weka can led to a penalty of up to 100,000 New Zealand dollars, or $59,000.Following an investigation, the country’s Department of Conservation issued Jones and the production team with a written warning instead, noting the “unique set of circumstances” of the show.In the show, which runs on USA Network, nine pairs of contestants navigate 150 miles of harsh terrain in a bid to win $500,000. Competitors must find their own food and water while also racing to the finish line.“The unique set of circumstances — cast members were fatigued and suffering from significant hunger, in an unusual group dynamic situation — meant we felt a warning letter was prudent,” Dylan Swain from the New Zealand Department of Conservation’s investigations team said in an emailed statement Wednesday.“Nonetheless, killing and eating a native protected species in this matter is unacceptable and the company is ‘on notice’ about the need for its program participants to adhere to conservation legislation.”“I made a mistake,” Jones said in a clip shared by USA Network after he and his teammate were disqualified from the show. “It was shortsighted. ... It was foolish. But the competition is very real. The difficulty of this is real, and survival in the bush in New Zealand is not easy.”“I knew it was breaking a rule, but that’s not important when you’re hungry,” he continued, noting that it was “difficult to be in a place where you’re so desperate and hungry .... and there’s creatures running around camp that we’re not allowed to eat.”The weka is native to New Zealand and has “a famously feisty and curious personality,” according to the country’s Department of Conservation, which says the bird’s “populations are subject to large fluctuations.”They are “charismatic birds that are often attracted to human activity,” according to New Zealand Birds Online, a digital encyclopedia of the nation’s birds. But those who live near them “often have a less charitable opinion, as they have to live with ever-watchful weka snatching opportunities to raid vegetable gardens, pilfer poultry food and eggs, and even steal dog food from the bowl,” it said.Most native species are protected by law in New Zealand and it is illegal to hunt them. There are four subspecies of weka, only one of which is considered to not be threatened, according to the Department of Conservation.Jones apologized for his actions on the show, adding that “it doesn’t sit lightly with me.”“What I did disrespected New Zealand and I’m sorry.”"
WaPo_46,"FBI should clean up its interactions with online platforms, DOJ watchdog says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/fbi-contacts-social-media-inspector-general-doj/,2024-07-24 21:00:19.122200,,"Happy Wednesday! Send news tips to: will.oremus@washpost.com.FBI should clean up its interactions with online platforms, Justice Dept. watchdog saysWeeks after the Supreme Court rejected a conservative-led push to block contacts between the U.S. government and social media companies, a new report from the Justice Department’s inspector general found that intelligence agencies’ communications with the companies have sometimes been undisciplined.The 53-page report, published Tuesday by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, affirmed that U.S. law enforcement agencies need to communicate with tech firms about foreign influence operations, such as Russia’s campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. But it warned that officials need to be more systematic and careful about the nature of those communications to ensure they don’t cross the line into government censorship.“We found that the Department does not have a comprehensive strategy for engagement with social media companies regarding foreign malign influence issues,” the report stated. It said this lack of policy “created a potential risk” of government infringement on protected speech and must be addressed. It also recommended that the DOJ be more open with the public about its work with social media companies.The report lays out a framework for the FBI to resume regular meetings with tech companies under new constraints.“The department concurs with and plans to address the two recommendations in the OIG report,” Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr told Tech Brief on Tuesday.In an official response included in the report, the Justice Department said it would resume regular meetings with social media companies by the end of August, after suspending them last year in response to a judge’s order. The department said it had already developed new protocols and future meetings would be conducted “in a manner that is entirely consistent” with the First Amendment.The inspector general’s report paints a far more nuanced picture of the FBI’s interactions with social media companies than Elon Musk’s “Twitter Files.”The Twitter Files, published beginning in late 2022, were generated by a group of journalists handpicked by Musk who pored through the company’s internal documents for evidence that it had suppressed conservative views. The work helped fuel allegations on the right of collusion between the Biden administration and the social media industry. Months later, the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana sued President Biden and other top U.S. officials, alleging that they had violated the First Amendment by conspiring with Meta, Twitter and YouTube to censor Americans’ speech about the coronavirus and elections.Lower courts largely accepted that argument and blocked contacts between the administration and tech firms, even as some cybersecurity experts warned that could hamstring efforts to combat foreign interference campaigns. In June, the Supreme Court overturned those rulings 6-3, finding that the plaintiffs did not show they were directly harmed by the Biden administration’s actions. The decision left open the question of where to draw the line between legitimate contacts and illegal coercion when the government works with social media companies.The report doesn’t allege any First Amendment violations. But it does suggest that the DOJ lacked clear policies to prevent them.In 2018, the FBI started regularly sharing with social media firms information on accounts known to belong to “foreign malign actors,” including those accounts’ handles, email addresses and IP addresses, the report finds. The agency shared that information with “no strings attached,” meaning it didn’t ask the companies for anything in return.Still, it often got results. For instance, social media companies acted on this sort of information to take down a foreign influence operation before the 2018 midterm elections and remove the accounts of Iranian trolls during a 2020 presidential debate, according to the report.FBI officials told the inspector general’s office that they kept the First Amendment in mind when talking to tech firms. But the report concluded that they lacked clear guidance on how exactly the First Amendment should constrain those conversations, creating a “risk” of overstepping the mark.Some experts said the inspector general’s report and the DOJ’s response represent a sensible path forward.“I think it’s great that meetings are going to start,” said Kat Duffy, senior fellow for digital and cyberspace policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. “I also think it’s important they be on the record and transparent about the fact those meetings are happening. It’s good for the public to be more informed.”Duffy said the threat of foreign influence operations affecting U.S. elections remains real, and communication between the government and tech firms is essential to identify and thwart them. But she said concerns about government officials overstepping are valid too.Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Center for Business and Human Rights, said the ideal scenario is “a common-sense approach where you have the government providing information, not regulation.”The report only covers the Justice Department’s interactions with tech companies, not those of other federal agencies.While the FBI has been one focus of conservative allegations of censorship, the lawsuit and Republican-led congressional hearings have also accused Biden himself, along with his former press secretary, former chief medical adviser Anthony S. Fauci, and Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, of colluding with tech firms.Researcher Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.Trump allies crush misinformation research ahead of election, despite Supreme Court ruling (Cat Zakrzewski and Naomi Nix)Senators demand OpenAI release data showing it keeps its AI safe (Pranshu Verma, Cat Zakrzewski and Nitasha Tiku)February AT&T outage blocked 25,000 emergency calls, FCC report says (Aaron Gregg)Senate to push forward with children online safety bills this week (NBC News)Meta releases open-source AI model it says rivals OpenAI, Google tech (Gerrit De Vynck and Naomi Nix)In blacked-out Gaza, Elon Musk’s Starlink opens tiny internet bubble (Eva Dou)Tesla reports 45 percent decline in quarterly profit (Trisha Thadani)Big Tech is spending billions on AI.

WaPo_48,"Man faints while driving 70 mph on highway. His grandson, 10, took the wheel.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2024/07/24/grandfather-unconscious-highway-grandson-rescue/,2024-07-24 21:00:19.122200,,"Drake Linn was riding in the passenger seat of his grandfather’s pickup truck last week, going about 70 mph as they towed a boat along Interstate 75 in Dalton, Ga.The grandfather, Hugh Cox, 68, was chatting on the phone with a co-worker when suddenly something was very wrong. Cox stopped talking and looked dazed. Drake called out to his grandfather and asked whether he was all right, but Cox did not answer. He was no longer conscious.Cox’s co-worker, who was still on the line, told Drake to use his grandfather’s cellphone to call his mother. Jessica Linn instructed her son to climb onto his grandfather’s lap, take hold of the wheel and pull over to the shoulder.Then the call dropped.“I felt like that was probably the last time I was going to hear his voice,” Linn said of her son. “It was just the most desperate and out-of-control feeling.”Cox is an insulin-dependent diabetic and always wears a glucose-monitoring device, which helps him control his blood sugar. The morning of the July 15 incident, Cox called his pharmacy to have his device replaced because it had stopped working the evening prior. The pharmacist told him that there was an insurance issue and that he needed to wait for it to be cleared.As a result, Cox didn’t realize that his sugar was rapidly dropping until it was too late. He went into a diabetic coma — which can lead to death if left untreated.“When your sugar starts getting low, you get confused. It really went low on me in a hurry,” said Cox, who had just picked up his boat at a repair shop in Dalton.“I didn’t know what was going on, and I was scared,” Drake said.Drake lives on a farm in Calhoun, Ga., and has driven golf carts and ATVs, his mother said.“There’s always an adult watching, but he drives alone,” Linn said.Drake’s experience behind the wheel gave him the confidence to take over his grandfather’s vehicle. He sat on his lap and maneuvered the car on the busy highway.“I was in the middle of the interstate, and I had no idea where I was, so I drove about a mile until I knew where I was,” Drake said.He had one thought going through his head: “I’ve got to go fast and get an ambulance here before he is about to die.”He pulled over to the shoulder of the highway and tapped the brakes enough to stop the car, but still gently so the boat didn’t crash forward, he said. He then called 911 and told the dispatcher what had happened and where he was located.“My papa is a diabetic,” he said, according to a recording of the call. “I pulled him over on the side of the road … we are right at Exit 320.”“I’m really scared,” Drake, who was in tears, told the dispatcher. “I don’t want him to die.”Police quickly arrived at the scene, followed by Linn, who made her way there as soon as her son called in a panic. An ambulance and firetruck came, too.Although Drake was relieved that help had arrived, he said, “I was still kind of shaky.”Rescue workers gave Cox an IV drip, and, within about 20 minutes, he said, he started to feel better. Once he was stable, his daughter drove him home.“My sugar has got low on me before, but that’s the worst it’s ever been,” Cox said.He knows that had his grandson not been there with him, things could have taken a tragic turn.“I usually go by myself when I pick up a boat … I asked him if he wanted to go, and we took off,” Cox said. “It was good I had him with me.”“I’m real proud of him,” Cox added. “He’s a good kid.”Drake’s parents said they weren’t surprised by his quick thinking.“He’s a unique little person,” his mother said. “If I could count on any 10-year-old in the world in that exact situation, it would be Drake.”“My own child saved my own parent,” Linn continued. “It made my heart swell.”Officials were stunned that such a young person had the capacity to calmly navigate a crisis.“That little boy’s actions were just extraordinary,” said Sheriff Mitch Ralston of the Gordon County Sheriff’s Office. “This is not something that happens every day. For him to pull that off was just amazing.”Ralston honored Drake for his bravery and rapid response with a Citizen Service Award on July 17 — which, coincidentally, was Drake’s 11th birthday. Officials also gave him a hat and a T-shirt, plus four tickets to an Atlanta Braves baseball game.“We wanted to do something for him because he not only saved his life and his grandfather’s life, but also some motorists’ lives,” Ralston said. “This kid is a hero, no doubt.”When asked whether he has advice for others who find themselves in emergency situations, Drake said yes.“Try to do your best,” he said. “And stay calm.”"

WaPo_50,Big Tech says AI is booming. Wall Street is starting to see a bubble.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/ai-bubble-big-tech-stocks-goldman-sachs/,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"SAN FRANCISCO — A growing group of Wall Street analysts and tech investors  is beginning to sound the alarm that the immense amount of money being poured into artificial intelligence by Big Tech companies, stock market investors and venture-capital firms could be leading to a financial bubble.On Tuesday, analysts on Google’s quarterly conference call peppered chief executive Sundar Pichai with questions about when the company’s $12-billion-a-quarter investment in AI would begin paying off. And in the past few weeks, big Wall Street investment banks including Goldman Sachs and Barclays, as well as VCs such as Sequoia Capital, have issued reports raising concerns about the sustainability of the AI gold rush, arguing that the technology might not be able to make the kind of money to justify the billions being invested into it. Stock prices for big AI names including Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are all up significantly this year.“Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful,” Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs’s most senior stock analyst and a 30-year veteran of covering tech companies, said in a recent report about AI. “Overbuilding things the world doesn’t have use for, or is not ready for, typically ends badly.”Covello’s comments are in sharp contrast to a different Goldman Sachs report from just over a year ago, in which some of the bank’s economists said AI could automate 300 million jobs around the world and increase global economic output by 7 percent in the next 10 years, spurring a spate of news coverage about the disruptive potential of AI.Barclays said Wall Street analysts are expecting Big Tech companies to spend around $60 billion a year on developing AI models by 2026, but reap only around $20 billion a year in revenue from AI by that point. That kind of investment would be enough to power 12,000 products of a similar size to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Barclays analysts wrote in a recent report.OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, kicking off a race in Silicon Valley to build new AI products and get people to use them. Big Tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars on the technology. Retail investors have bid up the price of those companies and their suppliers, especially Nvidia, which makes the computer chips used to train AI models. Year to date, shares of Google parent Alphabet are up 25 percent,  Microsoft is up 15 percent, and Nvidia shares are up 140 percent.Venture capitalists have also poured billions more into thousands of AI start-ups. The AI boom has helped contribute to the $55.6 billion that venture investors put into U.S. start-ups in the second quarter of 2024, the highest amount in a single quarter in two years, according to venture capital data firm PitchBook.Tech executives insist that AI will change whole swaths of modern life, in the same way the internet or mobile phones did. AI technology has indeed improved drastically and is already being used to translate documents, write emails and help programmers code. But concern over whether the tech industry will be able to recoup the billions of dollars it’s investing in AI anytime soon — or ever — has risen among some firms that only last year were heralding the boom.“We do expect lots of new services … but probably not 12,000 of them,” Barclays analysts wrote. “We sense that Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical.”In April, Meta, Google and Nvidia all signaled their commitment to going all in on AI by telling investors during quarterly earnings calls that they would ramp up the amount of money they’re spending on building data centers to train and run AI algorithms. Google reiterated Tuesday it would spend more than $12 billion a quarter on its AI build-out. Microsoft and Meta are due to report their own earnings next week and may give further indication about their AI road maps.Pichai said Tuesday that it would take time for AI products to mature and become more useful. He acknowledged the high cost of AI but said even if the AI boom slows down, the data centers and computer chips the company was buying could be put to other uses.“The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,” Pichai said. “Not investing to be at the front here has much more significant downsides.”A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment. A spokesperson for Meta did not respond to a request for comment.Vinod Khosla, who co-founded computer network systems company Sun Microsystems and is one of Silicon Valley’s most influential venture-capital investors, compared AI to personal computers, the internet and mobile phones in terms of how much it would  affect society.“These are all fundamentally new platforms. In each of these, every new platform causes a massive explosion in applications,” Khosla said. The rush into AI might cause a financial bubble where investors lose money, but that doesn’t mean the underlying technology won’t continue to grow and become more important, he said.“There was a dot-com bubble, according to Goldman Sachs, because prices went up and prices went down. According to me, internet traffic didn’t go down at all.”As AI changes the way people work, do business and interact with one another, many start-ups will fail, he said. But overall the industry will make money on AI. He predicts there will eventually be multiple trillion-dollar businesses in AI, such as humanoid robots, AI assistants and programs that can completely replicate the work of highly paid software engineers.But so far, AI is not contributing to an increase in venture capital getting a return on those investments. The amount of money made in venture capital exits, which represent initial public offerings or acquisitions of tech start-ups, fell to $23.6 billion in the second quarter, down slightly from $25.4 billion the previous quarter, according to PitchBook.The tech industry would need to generate around $600 billion in revenue a year to make up for all the money being invested in AI right now, yet it is far from close to that number, David Cahn, a partner at venture firm Sequoia Capital, wrote in a blog post last month.“Speculative frenzies are part of technology, and so they are not something to be afraid of,” Cahn said. “But we need to make sure not to believe in the delusion that has now spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world. That delusion says that we’re all going to get rich quick.”Microsoft’s and Google’s revenue are growing, especially in their cloud businesses where they sell access to AI algorithms and the storage space to use them. Executives from the companies say AI is driving new interest in their products and will become a major moneymaker in the future. But some analysts are pointing out that there have been very few hugely successful stand-alone products, besides OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s coding assistant GitHub Copilot.“Wall Street is growing increasingly skeptical given that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are the two breakout successes in consumer and enterprise thus far 20 months in,” the Barclays analysts wrote in their report.The cost of developing and running AI programs will come down as other companies compete with Nvidia and the technology becomes more efficient, said Vineet Jain, CEO of Egnyte, an AI and data management company. For now, the cost of providing AI products is too expensive, and he doesn’t expect to make any AI-specific revenue this year. But as costs go down and demand continues to rise, that will change, Jain said.“The value proposition is absolutely there, but the expectation right now is still unrealistic,” he said, referring to the frenzy to sell AI products to consumers and businesses.Some start-ups have already come down from the heights of the early part of the AI boom. Inflection AI, a start-up founded by veterans of Google’s famous DeepMind AI lab, raised $1.3 billion last year to build out their chatbot business. But in March, the company’s founders left for jobs at Microsoft, taking some of their top employees with them to the tech giant. Other AI companies, like Stability AI, which was one of the first companies to build a widely popular AI image generator, have had to lay off workers. The industry is also facing lawsuits and regulatory challenges.Bigger companies like Google and Microsoft will be able to keep spending money until demand for AI products increases, but smaller start-ups that have taken on a lot of venture capital might not survive the transition, Jain said.“It’s like a soufflé that keeps popping up and popping up, it has to come down a bit.”"
WaPo_51,Who has the best creemee in Vermont? Locals share 6 favorites.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/24/best-creemee-vermont/,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"While most Vermonters can agree on how to spell it, picking a favorite “creemee” isn’t nearly as easy.“This is like choosing your favorite child,” said Carrie Honaker, a food writer and Vermont native.The regional ice cream can be found throughout the state, served everywhere from gas stations and hotel lobbies to roadside shacks and maple syrup farms. Given the state’s top-tier dairy and maple syrup industries, the delicacy couldn’t make more sense. For tourists, tracking down a creemee (or two) is an important part of visiting the state, on par with digging into a Maine lobster roll or a Chicago dog.Flavors range from the iconic maple and classic vanilla and chocolate to refreshing twists like limoncello, lemon poppy seed, and strawberry. Creemees, specifically maple creemees, are, well, creamier than most other soft serves. The first difference is a high percentage of butterfat. According to Laura Mack, owner and founder of Lu lu Ice Cream in Vergennes, creemees are 10 percent milk fat, compared to 4 percent for traditional soft serve.Another reason for the luscious texture is the addition of maple, which reduces the freezing point; the more sugar in an ice cream, the softer it will be.Kingdom Creamery, Leslie Michaud’s family farm in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, produces ice cream mix for many of the creemee stands in the state. Michaud describes the delicate balance between flavor and floppy: “If you add too much, it won’t freeze right because you’re adding a liquid sugar and if you add too little, your flavor is not going to be as robust as you want it.”Cara Tobin, chef and co-owner of Honey Road, said the creemee is special because it’s a sign of summer.“Winters are so dark and cold. When you finally see the light of spring and the warm weather to come, it’s so joyous and welcome,” Tobin said.The origins of the name remain a mystery. It could be a reference to the Cree-Mee — a regional chain of soft-serve stands popular in the 1950s — a play on the French word for ice cream, crème glacée, or a simple reference to texture.According to Pam Green, a Rutland County maple producer, the maple creemee was first introduced at the Vermont State Fair in Rutland in 1981 by the Rutland County Maple Producers. C. Blake Roy, an inspector for the Vermont Department of Agriculture, worked with Seward’s Dairy to craft the first maple creemee mix.“It’s not made in a lab, or a factory -- it’s made in small farms across the state,” says Mark L. Isselhardt, who leads the Extension Maple Program at the University of Vermont. “There’s a lot of mystery behind why one batch of syrup tastes different than another, and it’s just tree sap boiled down.”Tobin adds that the perfect creemee isn’t just about taste, but how it swirls. It should stand in a proper cylinder. It should be creamy, not icy. And the flavor should be as advertised: “Does the vanilla taste like vanilla?” she asks. “Does the maple taste like maple?”Considering all the factors that make for a memorable creemee, here are six places to try the frozen treat.Set alongside the rolling hills of Montpelier, Morse Farm tops the list for scenery. The cones are perfectly balanced with a maple flavor that is not too sweet, but most definitely present. The sugarhouse is open to the public, and you can learn more about the maple syrup making process from the eighth-generation maple farm.“Most creemee stands are seasonal, but Morse Farms in Montpelier has them year-round, and they are a working farm and sugarhouse that is open to the public,” says Honaker, the food writer. “[It’s] a great day trip when you have kids in tow.”1168 County Rd., Montpelier, morsefarm.comSitting on the front porch of Palmer Lane Maple with a maple creemee cone almost makes up for the harsh New England winter. The business operates out of an 1830’s farmhouse, just outside of the center of Jericho.“Palmer Lane Maple has magical maple dust they roll their creemees in and their maple syrup is delicious,” Honaker says.In addition to maple, Palmer Lane advertises coffee, peppermint, black cherry and vanilla creemees, as well as creemee cookie sandwiches.

WaPo_52,"Before confirming Salt Lake City 2034, IOC members push back on USADA",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/salt-lake-city-2034-olympics-usada-chinese-doping/,2024-07-25 02:00:19.122200,,"PARIS — The International Olympic Committee long had determined that Salt Lake City would be the host of the 2034 Winter Olympics, but as the full membership met Wednesday morning to give formal approval, some IOC members pushed back against attacks from the United States against the World Anti-Doping Agency.In what appeared to be a coordinated effort, led by IOC president Thomas Bach, several IOC members said Salt Lake City should be approved only under the condition that U.S. criticism of WADA end. Acrimony between U.S. anti-doping authorities and their global counterparts has escalated since revelations in April that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine at the end of 2020 yet the results were never so much as identified publicly. The following year, thirteen of those swimmers competed in the Tokyo Olympics and won several medals, including three golds.The IOC eventually did award Salt Lake the 2034 Olympics by an 83-6 vote but only after inserting a clause in the contract that permits the organization to pull back the Games if, as its news release said, “the supreme authority of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the fight against doping is not fully respected or if the application of the World Anti-Doping Code is hindered or undermined.”Later, Fraser Bullock, the CEO of the Salt Lake-Utah Committee for the Games, said the contract, with its amendment, had already been signed by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, Utah Gov. Spencer J. Cox and the IOC before the IOC members began Wednesday’s debate.The criticism from IOC members and Bach, seemed directed at Travis Tygart, the president of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, even if Tygart was not mentioned by name. Tygart, who has battled ferociously with WADA officials over the Chinese cases, has encouraged U.S. law enforcement departments and Congress to look into the matter. Last month, Tygart and star swimmer Michael Phelps told the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s oversight and investigations subcommittee that they worry about the Olympics’ future if such cases aren’t pursued with more vigor.“WADA was accused by some stakeholder representatives and media of the worst possible thing an anti-doping agency could have happen: that it covers up cases of anti-doping,” IOC member Ingmar De Vos told Wednesday’s session.Later, he added, “We need to understand where [the criticism] is going in the future and where it will end.”Wednesday afternoon, Tygart responded with a statement that said, in part, “It is shocking to see the IOC itself stooping to threats in an apparent effort to silence those seeking answers to what are now known as facts. It seems more apparent than ever that WADA violated the rules and needs accountability and reform to truly be the global watchdog that clean athletes need.”WADA and USADA have verbally battled for years over allegations from Tygart that WADA isn’t strong enough on doping issues. But the IOC generally has stayed away from the fight, which is what made Wednesday’s move by the IOC members such a surprise. In a Wednesday news conference, USOPC and Salt Lake City executives tried to downplay the IOC members’ comments by saying that U.S. government agencies, WADA and the IOC all want to eliminate doping.The New York Times has reported the FBI and Justice Department have opened investigations into the Chinese swimmer case, though no such inquiries have been acknowledged publicly. Passed by Congress five years ago, the Rodchenkov Act allows for criminal investigations into anti-doping issues by U.S. authorities, something global Olympic and anti-doping leaders have found unsettling.After the news conference, Cox said the IOC’s concern was “a subpoena issued to a member of WADA when they were in the United States.”A WADA spokesman said none of its officials have been served a subpoena, but earlier this month World Aquatics told several media agencies that its executive director had been subpoenaed by U.S. investigators.In a joint statement issued later Wednesday, Energy and Commerce committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and ranking member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) said: “It speaks volumes that the IOC would demand a one-sided contract condition to protect WADA rather than work together to ensure it is fulfilling its mission to protect clean sport. The eyes of the world are about to turn toward the Paris Olympics where athletes should be able to compete on a level playing field, but unfortunately these reports cast further doubt on WADA.”The feuding overshadowed what otherwise was a day of celebration for Salt Lake, which will host the Games for the second time this century. Because so much of the area’s arenas and ski areas from the 2002 Winter Games have been so well-maintained, Salt Lake long has been seen as an obvious selection for another Olympics.Late last year, the IOC’s future host commission chose Salt Lake City for 2034, essentially making Wednesday’s vote a rubber stamp. Similarly, the IOC also approved the French Alps bid for the 2030 Games, contingent on the government guaranteeing funding which has been held up by recent elections."
WaPo_53,Hillary Clinton says Harris can beat Trump despite ‘sexism’ in politics,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/hillary-clinton-kamala-harris-endorsement-oped/,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"Hillary Clinton, who holds a spot in history as the country’s only female presidential nominee from a major party, is now hoping Kamala Harris can do what she couldn’t: defeat Donald Trump and break the “highest, hardest glass ceiling” in American politics.Clinton, in an op-ed endorsing Harris in the New York Times, says she knows how Vice President Harris can do it this time.1/5“I know a thing or two about how hard it can be for strong women candidates to fight through the sexism and double standards of American politics,” Clinton wrote, championing Harris — who is now the likely Democratic nominee — as a “a savvy former prosecutor and successful vice president who embodies our faith that America’s best days are still ahead.”Harris’s “record and character will be distorted and disparaged” as she runs against former president Donald Trump, Clinton warned, adding that “she and the campaign will have to cut through the noise.”Clinton, who had previously endorsed Harris, suggested that she lean on her record as a prosecutor and President Biden’s vice president. “She has a great story to tell about the accomplishments of this administration,” she said.Clinton also said that the GOP push for abortion bans after Roe v. Wade was overturned — which has already given Democrats a powerful argument to turn out their base — could help further galvanize women voters.Clinton, who in 2016 was the first woman to be on a major party ticket, faced a bitter and bruising campaign in which Trump repeatedly mocked her appearance and questioned her mental health. “I’ve been called a witch, a ‘nasty woman’ and much worse. I was even burned in effigy. As a candidate, I sometimes shied away from talking about making history. I wasn’t sure voters were ready for that,” she said. “While it still pains me that I couldn’t break that highest, hardest glass ceiling, I’m proud that my two presidential campaigns made it seem normal to have a woman at the top of the ticket.”Clinton notes that Harris will face even more challenges as the first Black and South Asian woman to be at the top of a major party’s ticket. “That’s real, but we shouldn’t be afraid,” she said. “It is a trap to believe that progress is impossible.” Already, Harris has faced attacks that her supporters likened to the racist tropes about Black women — and some Republicans have decried her as a potential “DEI” president, referencing diversity, equity and inclusion programs that conservatives who want to end them claim lead minorities to get jobs over more qualified White candidates. Harris is “chronically underestimated, as are so many women in politics, but she is well prepared for this moment,” Clinton wrote.Clinton suggested that Harris focus on policy achievements of the Biden administration — including steering U.S. economic recovery in the wake of the covid pandemic, tackling the cost of drugs and student debt.Biden has added 15 million jobs in less than four years, brought the Black unemployment rate to a record low and reduced student loan debt by billions, as The Post has previously reported, though Trump presided over a period of low inflation, low interest rates and low gas prices. While Biden’s White House has aimed to cancel huge amounts of student loan debt, Republicans have challenged his plans in court and broadly argue such relief is fiscally irresponsible and unfair to the those who never attended college or already paid off their education loans.“Ms. Harris will have to reach out to voters who have been skeptical of Democrats and mobilize young voters who need convincing. But she can run on a strong record and ambitious plans to further reduce costs for families, enact common-sense gun safety laws and restore and protect our rights and freedoms,” Clinton wrote.Clinton acknowledged that there is limited time to organize a successful campaign for Harris with elections due in the next three months but argued that it was possible, pointing to recent left-wing political victories in Britain and France.Harris, Clinton wrote, should lean into her past roles as a prosecutor, in her fight against Trump — whom she called “a convicted criminal who cares only about himself and is trying to turn back the clock on our rights and our country.”"
WaPo_54,Planned Parenthood’s push to get voters to the polls,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/planned-parenthoods-push-get-voters-polls/,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"Good morning! I’m Molly Castle Work, a KFF Health News correspondent based in Los Angeles. Planned Parenthood is spending more than $40 million in an effort to elect a Congress that supports abortion rights. Republicans say it won’t work. Got a tip? Send it to mwork@kff.org.Today’s edition: U.S. teenage birth rates declined, but wide racial discrepancies remain. Families of fentanyl victims and others called on the White House to close a loophole they say makes it easier to mail packages containing illicit drugs to the United States. But first …Making abortion the No. 1 election issuePlanned Parenthood’s political and advocacy organizations will use a more than $40 million war chest to blitz GOP officeholders and candidates in an effort to flip the House and maintain Democratic control of the Senate and presidency.The plan is to focus on the records of Republicans who have repeatedly voted against access to abortion, contraceptives, in vitro fertilization or gender-affirming care for trans people. On Tuesday, the organization’s lobbying arm, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, announced its endorsement of Kamala Harris for president.Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, the right to abortion has proved to be an issue that motivates voters, and Planned Parenthood is betting that will again be true at the ballot box this fall. News that Harris is now the leading Democratic presidential candidate, with President Biden stepping back, is also energizing advocates.Alexis McGill Johnson, Planned Parenthood Action Fund president and CEO, called Harris “one of the fiercest voices we have on sexual and reproductive rights.”“Having spent meaningful time and energy with abortion providers, patients, organizers and advocates, the Vice President’s presence takes the conversation around abortion rights to heights we’ve never seen before in a presidential campaign,” she said. “There’s no doubt that she will generate new energy for the future of the fight ahead.”Twenty-five states ban abortion in almost all circumstances or limit access to it beginning early in pregnancy. Other states are considering similar restrictions. And support for a national abortion ban may pick up currency if Republicans gain control of Congress and the White House.Shwetika Baijal, who runs political initiatives for Planned Parenthood, said recent elections have shown that abortion drives voter turnout, especially among young people and people of color. An example of this is the 2022 Kansas primary election, in which voters from a red state turned out in record numbers shortly after the Dobbs decision to resoundingly protect abortion rights.“I think you find that when you take someone’s rights away, it makes them really angry,” Baijal said.The national Planned Parenthood campaign is hoping to leverage this anger starting with races in several battleground states, including Arizona, Michigan and Nevada. The aggressive ad campaign has already hit multiple platforms, including podcasts like Call Her Daddy, a sex and relationship show, which has received an average of 5 million listeners a week.On top of that, Planned Parenthood’s California affiliates will spend a seven-figure amount to target eight congressional districts, most of which typically vote Republican but in which voters supported a 2022 ballot measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.Republicans dismiss the Planned Parenthood efforts, noting that even districts that backed the 2022 measure also voted to keep their Republican leaders in charge. California Assembly Republican leader James Gallagher, who is on the state Republican Party board, said he doesn’t see a reason the 2024 elections will play out differently.“People can be supportive of abortion rights and still vote for the Republicans because they feel the Republican is better at addressing the everyday issues,” Gallagher said.Baijal said calling attention to Republicans’ voting records is crucial now that many are backing away from long-held, hard-line antiabortion positions that are proving unpopular. Some candidates, like Republican Senate nominee Sam Brown of Nevada, have pledged to protect abortion rights, even if their past statements suggest otherwise.“We have to talk about what these people are trying to do, not what they’re saying,” Baijal says.KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — an independent source of health policy research, polling and journalism.Teen birth rates dropped, but there are still disparitiesThe number of teenage births dropped 69 percent from 2000 to 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released today, The Post’s Dan Keating reports.“Having a teen birth can have a huge effect on a young woman’s life,” Anne K. Driscoll, the study’s lead author, told The Washington Post. “Whether or not she finishes even high school or has any further education, her income and poverty status and all that looks very different as a teen mom versus if she’s in her 20s at least.”Key context: Birth rate declines were similar across races, but wide discrepancies remain, with much higher rates of births among Native American, Black and Hispanic teenagers. In 2000, more than 475,100 children were born to all teenagers. In 2022, the latest year studied, there were 145,313 such births. The largest birth rate decline — a drop of 79 percent — was among girls between ages 15 and 17.In 2022, more Hispanic teenagers gave birth than any other group of teens — they had 57,256 children, representing 39 percent of all teen births.The overall declines were attributed to teenagers becoming sexually active at a later age, less sexual activity among teenage girls and more effective use of birth control among sexually active teenagers, according to the study’s authors.CDC flags shortage of blood culture bottlesThe CDC alerted health-care providers, medical labs and others Tuesday about “a critical shortage” of special bottles used to identify bacteria and fungi in blood. The shortage of Becton Dickinson (BD) BACTEC blood culture media bottles could delay the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases, the CDC says.The blood culture bottles contain nutrients that help germs in blood samples multiply, making them easier to detect and identify. Blood cultures are critical for diagnosing and managing infectious diseases in the bloodstream and related conditions, including sepsis, endocarditis and catheter-related bloodstream infections.Families of fentanyl victims, and members of law enforcement and nonprofit groups on Tuesday urged the White House to fix a trade law that makes it easier to send packages containing illicit drugs into the United States from countries such as China, The Post’s David Ovalle reports.In a letter sent to President Biden, the Coalition to Close the De Minimis Loophole said the loophole lets bad actors hide counterfeit pills, chemicals used to make the illicit opioid fentanyl and pill presses among the 4 million packages that arrive daily in the United States from abroad.The loophole allows parcels valued at $800 or less to avoid customs duties and has spurred a dramatic increase in packages from Chinese e-commerce companies. Officials say chemicals used by Mexican cartels to make fentanyl generally come from China, although the finished opioid mostly arrives via ports of entry along the southern border.Army acknowledges lapses, inaction before Maine mass shootingBefore military reservist Robert Card killed 18 people in a mass shooting in Maine on Oct. 25, he displayed warning signs that his Army supervisors failed to address, according to the findings of an investigation made public Tuesday, The Post’s Alex Horton reports.Key context: Investigators identified “multiple communication failures” between military and civilian hospitals treating Card and his chain of command that affected his “continuity of care,” according to the Army’s report. But officials found no evidence connecting the shootings to Card’s military service.Card’s family informed law enforcement about his mental health and access to firearms in the months before the shooting. The Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office did not try hard enough to make contact with him, the report found. An independent review requested by the sheriff’s office found that the deputies “acted reasonably.”PBMs grilled on alleged anticompetitive policiesLawmakers on Capitol Hill grilled pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for their alleged anticompetitive policies yesterday.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, led by Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), also released a report saying the three largest PBM managers — CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and OptumRx — have implemented anticompetitive pricing tactics that undermine community pharmacies and harming patients across the United States. PBMs are third-party administrators that negotiate contracts with health insurance plans and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

They will lead their U.S. teammates in first-of-their-kind Opening Ceremonies, parading in boats down Paris’s iconic Seine.Gauff, ranked No. 2 in the world, is appearing in her first Olympics. She planned to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 before she tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing her to withdraw.“I never thought in a million years I would have the honor of carrying the American flag for Team USA,” Gauff said in a statement. “I could not be more proud to lead my teammates with LeBron as we showcase our dedication and passion on the biggest stage there is — at a moment where we can bring athletes and fans together from around the world.”Gauff and James earned the honors by a vote of U.S. Olympians in a process overseen by the Team USA Athletes Commission. Fellow American tennis player Chris Eubanks nominated Gauff.“I’m incredibly proud of Coco — I know how great she is as a tennis player, but more importantly, how great she is as a person,” Eubanks said. “I don’t think there is anyone more deserving of this honor.”Gauff has won seven individual titles, most notably the 2023 U.S. Open, along with nine doubles titles, including this year’s French Open. Gauff began her ascent to the top of tennis when she reached the fourth round of Wimbledon as a 15-year-old in 2019.“To be nominated by your teammates for this honor speaks volumes about the way in which Coco approaches her sport and her role as a member of Team USA,” U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said. “I’m thrilled for her to start her Olympic journey here in Paris and, with LeBron, to lead Team USA and inspire fans around [the] United States and the world.”"
WaPo_56,‘The Modern Fairies’ is a raucous work of historical fiction,https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/07/24/clare-pollard-modern-fairies-review/,2024-07-24 20:00:19.122200,,"It is the late 17th century, and King Louis XIV is at the pinnacle of his power. Versailles is the hub of the French aristocracy, a great beehive dripping with honey — and bristling with stingers. We are in the era of the great salons, the private gatherings where nobles and intellectuals converged to hon-hon the issues of the day. Clare Pollard’s work of historical fiction, “The Modern Fairies,” grants us entry into one such salon hosted by Madame Marie d’Aulnoy, a real-life salonnière and author, who has, as the story begins, mysteriously been rehabilitated after scandal and imprisonment.The theme of Marie’s salon is fairy tales and proto-feminism. Each chapter, more or less, features a guest telling their version of a tale, most notably Charles Perrault, who will in time collect these tales into his famous volume, “Contes de ma mere l’Oye”: Mother Goose tales. In the opening chapter, Perrault begins a tale about a king loved by his people, feared by his enemies, and blessed with the most beautiful of wives and daughters. The guests lean in, eager to hear what misfortune will befall this perfect family. “For the energy that lies behind all stories is a destructive energy,” the narrator warns us, full of “the urge to burn down what is for what might be.”If this sounds like Angela Carter rewriting “The Canterbury Tales,” you’re not far off. But “The Modern Fairies” is more than mere homage. Versailles is clutched in a desperate battle between Louis’s mistresses, and the collateral damage is only growing. As storms gather, the guests begin to use fairy tales as a way to speak openly — an increasingly dangerous game. To fall afoul of the king can be swiftly lethal, and the king has spies everywhere, overseen by his utterly sinister chief of police, Reynie.The Modern Fairies gather at Marie’s salon because there’s more honesty in fairy tales than in the cant to which they, as members of the aristocracy, must publicly subscribe. There are wolves in the forest. Hunger will make a parent abandon their children. Love can destroy you. Men do execute their wives for asking questions. Faced with the brutal truths around them, the guests in Marie’s salon want to believe in their own happy endings. Thus, they measure each storyteller by how well they stick the landing: They are savage to those who try to get away with sanctimonious morals or unearned happy endings.Unfortunately, the novel’s most important storyteller is also its most frustrating element. Like Molière’s famous hypochondriac Argan in “The Imaginary Invalid,” “The Modern Fairies” is hobbled by its own crutch. Pollard’s story structure depends entirely on a narrator who can enter the mind of any character, no matter how minor. She refers to herself as “I” and holds her “dear reader” by the elbow in a voice that combines Jane Eyre and Lady Whistledown from “Bridgerton” — except that sometimes, her diction pitches into 2020s English.The narrator describes Versailles under Louis XIV as a “panopticon,” a term which wouldn’t be coined for a hundred years, and wouldn’t acquire its modern, metaphorical sense until a century and a half after that. In a jarringly op-ed-like paragraph, she writes of “human sexuality being as wildly beautiful and various as it is,” and of organized religion as a “system of brainwashing.” “Brainwashing” and “human sexuality” did not exist in the court of Louis XIV, or any other Bourbon. These anachronisms continually disrupt the fictional dream of this novel.The same is true of the inconsistent — and patronizing — use of translation. At one point early on, Pollard invokes the Académie Française, “known as ‘les immortels’ after the academy’s motto ‘À l’immortalité.’ (‘To Immortality.’)” This smacks of distrust in the reader, but it happens with some regularity. Midway through the book, Marie d’Aulnoy tells a character “you are joining our group of Modern Fairies, Les Fées Modernes!” Marie, we know.Worse, Pollard keeps us completely in the dark about just who this narrator is until the final chapter, a grave mistake. Had she offered this story up to Marie’s salon, the guests would have been merciless about this choice. They’d have pointed out that veiling a narrator’s identity in mystery requires A) that the narrator have a good reason for keeping it secret, and B) that when the secret is revealed, we suddenly see the story in a whole new way. Not so in “The Modern Fairies,” a book I would have enjoyed far more if I had not spent so much of it trying to figure out who was interrupting this otherwise galloping story. Was it a servant? A salon guest? Belle-Belle, the pet marmoset? No. It’s audacious and would be an intriguing idea — if it had been introduced by Chapter 2.In its breadth and variety and ambition, “The Modern Fairies” can feel furiously grotesque, like one of the sybaritic nightly banquets Louis enjoys, featuring hundreds of dishes — at which the king himself consumes gargantuan meals, even though an oral infection has lately carved a hole in his sinus, meaning that food bubbles disgustingly out of his nose as he devours it. (He is also suffering from an anal fistula, about which we hear a great deal.) Pollard lays out more courses than we can possibly savor, yet each dish is exquisitely made — and researched. At its best, her writing is velveted with human insight, especially when it comes to the artifice of appearances: Her characters’ clothes and makeup are rendered with jarring precision. Pollard’s women do not apply lipstick, they lacquer their mouths with dyed animal fat; when they powder their faces, they do so with the white lead that scourges the skin it brightens.Ultimately, the finest moments in “The Modern Fairies” are not the most rococo or outrageous (the sex is graphic and abundant, but rarely pleasurable for the women involved) but rather the most intimate. A scene of Marie with her daughters and servants as they clean up after a salon is very affecting. Most encouragingly, the book’s third act is its strongest. “I cannot quite promise happy ever after,” the narrator warns us in the end, “not even an old storyteller such as I.” But rest assured: She sticks the landing.Samuel Ashworth is the author of the forthcoming novel “The Death and Life of August Sweeney,” about the rise and fall of a legendary chef, told through his autopsy.By Clare PollardAvid Reader. 249 pp. $28"
WaPo_57,‘I thought it was safe’: Why lawsuits are mounting over this chemical linked to cancer,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/24/ethylene-oxide-lawsuits-epa-cancer/,2024-07-24 19:00:19.122200,,"A knock on the door forced Cathy Flint to her feet. It had been five years since her diagnosis of multiple myeloma, a cancer that has left her with bones protruding from her neck and down her spine, bone damage and hunched shoulders.On that day in spring 2023, her neighbor stood in her doorway with a letter.It was a questionnaire from environmental lawyers asking residents in her Charleston, W.Va., neighborhood if they had experienced any injuries or ailments, including cancer, because of exposure to ethylene oxide — a gas, released by nearby chemical manufacturing plants, that federal agencies have said is linked to numerous cancers.Flint looked toward the plants, one of which stood less than 750 feet away. It was the first time she had questioned how safe they were or wondered whether her cancer could be linked to exposure to potentially unsafe chemicals.“It was just part of life in this valley. There’s plants everywhere,” said Flint, 64, a resident there for nearly 30 years. “I didn’t really think much about it. I thought it was safe. Evidently, it wasn’t.”This month, Flint filed a lawsuit in Kanawha County Circuit Court against Dow Chemical’s Union Carbide subsidiary and numerous other companies that manufacture the gas, often used to sterilize medical equipment. A growing number of lawsuits are taking on companies that release what plaintiffs claim are dangerous levels of an odorless, colorless gas associated with numerous types of cancer.The lawsuit filed by Flint — who believes the gas caused her incurable multiple myeloma — alleges that the companies’ “dangerous, negligent, harmful and reckless emission of ethylene oxide gas” during production, storage and transportation of the substance caused high concentrations throughout the area. Meanwhile, a slew of environmental groups have sued the Environmental Protection Agency in federal court, arguing that a March update of national emissions standards doesn’t do enough to protect residents from cancer-causing pollutants, including ethylene oxide.“Over the years, there’s been no education of the public, by government agencies or anybody else, to advise people on what the risks are living in an area where there are countless toxic molecules belching out of these plants daily,” said Stuart Calwell, an environmental attorney representing Flint. “If you choose to keep those molecules, those dangerous instruments on your property, then you are responsible if any of them get out.”In a statement, Union Carbide Corp. said the facilities in the area continue to operate in compliance with all their permits and have taken actions to reduce ethylene oxide emissions “below their already safe levels.”“UCC has successfully litigated these issues already in West Virginia” and is “ready to defend this misguided complaint,” the company said.Calwell said Flint’s lawsuit is the first of more than two dozen to be filed by area residents who have claims related to cancer or other health issues, including Parkinson’s disease. At least 200 other people have made inquiries that his attorney group is still investigating.Kelly McCown grew up on Flint’s block and lived in the area for over two decades. By the time she was 16, McCown learned that severe symptoms during her periods were a result of polycystic ovary syndrome — cysts on her ovaries — and that she also had cysts in her breast.“I would say that I’m a rock,” the 44-year-old said with a wry laugh about her cysts and routine kidney stones. Doctors recently found cysts on her liver.Doctors told her it would be nearly impossible to get pregnant. Concerned that the nearby chemical plants could be affecting her health, she said, doctors even suggested she consider moving. Now, McCown, working with Calwell, says she is in the process of filing a lawsuit against the same group of companies.Current EPA standards for all air toxins limit the acceptable lifetime cancer risk to 1 in 1 million people. A mapping tool from the EPA shows that cancer risk for residents in Flint’s neighborhood was 300 in 1 million in 2020. The risk was 200 in 1 million in 2018, the year Flint received her diagnosis.The Biden administration said the updated standards were expected to curb ethylene oxide emissions by more than 90 percent, also reducing the cancer risks. The administration estimated that the standards would put the cancer risk from ethylene oxide at or above 1 in 1 million — a reduction from about 7.2 million people to about 6.3 million — but advocates say that doesn’t go nearly far enough.“That doesn’t really comport with EPA’s obligation to minimize the number of people who are exposed to cancer risk like that,” said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group. Lawyers are likely to challenge the EPA by alleging that the agency failed to reduce ethylene oxide emissions and to protect people from cancer.“You could reduce emissions further, and it’s important that you do so, because this rule is going to leave nearly 6 million people in harm’s way,” said Russ, who is also director of the group’s Center for Applied Environmental Science.Dealing with ethylene oxide is a top EPA priority, said agency spokesman Remmington Belford. Although the agency can’t comment on pending litigation, he said, it is “coordinating with air agencies to share information with communities about the risks from long-term exposure to [ethylene oxide] in the outdoor air and has provided technical support to air agencies as part of this work.”Long-term exposure to ethylene oxide can increase the risk of various cancers, including breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, according to the EPA. It also has been linked to developmental complications, miscarriage and other reproductive impacts.The gas is harmful to humans even at low concentrations.The North Charleston community was “known as ‘Cancer Bottom’ for a while,” McCown said. Both of her paternal grandparents, who lived in the area, died of cancer.“We didn’t realize that it was so dangerous,” McCown said. “You wouldn’t think that anyone would put something out that would hurt people, or that anyone would be allowed to put anything out to hurt anyone.”Flint was heartbroken when she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells. She has received stem-cell treatment and will have to undergo chemotherapy for the rest of her life. Multiple myeloma “eats holes in your bones,” she said, explaining why she gets monthly shots to strengthen them.She said she worries about developing other cancers and noted that two of her neighbors have died of cancer in recent years. “I just hate it that I have to live this life. It’s not fun,” she said.A 2023 analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that more than 14 million people live within five miles of facilities that emit ethylene oxide. Almost 60 percent of those people identified as people of color, and 31 percent are low-income.In June, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that ethylene oxide measurements across parts of Louisiana were routinely underestimated by the EPA’s screening tools, leaving communities at much greater risk for cancer than previously thought. The Hopkins researchers found that average concentrations at some locations were 10 times the EPA’s acceptable cancer risk for a lifetime of exposure.The EPA risk model is based on estimates reported by the facilities, said senior author Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the university’s Department of Environmental Health and Engineering. “I think they’re very frequently, and most of the time, very big underestimates.”Calwell hopes lawsuits like Flint’s will force regulators to consider the cumulative emissions in an area, instead of allowing emissions up to the maximum acceptable cancer risk.Flint said she hopes her suit will also help the community understand more about emissions and the potential health risks.“These plants need to be held accountable,” she said."
WaPo_58,"A long weekend with John Lennon’s ‘lost weekend’ girlfriend, May Pang",https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2024/07/24/may-pang-lennon-photos/,2024-07-24 19:00:19.122200,,"Do you ever talk to Yoko? someone in the crowd asked. Did Paul and George ever call Ringo “Richie”?How did you meet John?May Pang is used to the questions. She has devoted much of her life to recounting her affair a half-century ago with John Lennon, a period he memorably described as “the lost weekend that lasted 18 months,” one that catapulted her into Beatles lore.Now 73, Pang is retelling her version of the story that began in 1973 when Yoko Ono encouraged her — then the couple’s 22-year-old assistant — to become Lennon’s lover. All these years later, Pang is traveling the country exhibiting photos she took of her famous paramour, a tour that last weekend reached Northern Virginia, where fans lined up for her autograph and a look at images fit for a family album.Here was a picture of Lennon with a bowl of hot and sour soup in the Manhattan apartment they shared in 1974; here was another of Lennon playfully sticking out his tongue; here he was at Disney World, “a face in the crowd,” as Pang titled the image, a few months before he left her to return to Ono.“I’m the closest they’re going to get to John Lennon,” Pang said as she signed photos for buyers. “What gives me pleasure is giving people the stories. And I’m able to give the stories because I was the one who was there.”The tell-all memoir is nothing new in the annals of rock-and-roll. What sets Pang apart are the varied forms her storytelling has taken over the past four decades. Her memoir, “Loving John,” was published in 1983, three years after Lennon’s murder, followed by “Instamatic Karma,” a 2008 collection of her Lennon photos. In 2022, Pang was the subject of “The Lost Weekend: A Love Story,” a documentary in which she declares: “I was 23 and my first boyfriend was John Lennon.”And now there’s her traveling photo show, which arrived this past weekend at the Nepenthe Gallery and Frame Shop, tucked in an Alexandria strip mall behind an Exxon station and a pet food store.Yes, the money she makes from the exhibit is part of the incentive, Pang said, sitting at a table with a stack of “Lost Weekend” posters she signed and sold for $50 a pop (“I like to pay my rent,” she said). But Pang, who grew up in Spanish Harlem and lives in Queens, also said her aim is to correct the “misconception” that Lennon “didn’t care about me and it wasn’t a real relationship,” a narrative that, over time, she has blamed Ono and her allies for perpetuating. “If this was you and someone took your story, how would you feel?”Pang told the gallery crowd that Lennon, during his solo career, was the happiest and most creative while with her. He completed three albums in that period, including “Mind Games,” which was reissued this month, traveled regularly with Pang between New York and Los Angeles, and hung out with friends she refers to as “Elton” (John), “Mick” (Jagger), “Harry” (Nilsson), and “Paul and Linda” (McCartney).Her photos, Pang said, are evidence that the period was not the booze-fueled spree depicted by biographers and even Lennon himself when he told Playboy in 1980 that he had “never drunk so much in my life” and that “somebody was going to die” if he did not return to Ono.“It was a happy time, it was a creative time,” Pang told the crowd at her opening.Many praised her for sharing her past.“Thank you for bringing this to the world,” Fran Redding, 81, told Pang as she gazed at her wall of photos, including one of Lennon’s signature just after he signed his name on papers dissolving the Beatles (price: $10,000). There was also a shot Pang took that she says is the “last known photograph” of Lennon and McCartney together (price: $2,450).Mark Plotkin, 69, Pang’s friend who turned out for the opening, recalled accompanying her to the 2002 George Harrison memorial concert in London. Following the show, Pang led him to an “after-after party,” where he heard someone say in a familiar British voice, “Oh my God, May Pang!”“There was Paul McCartney with all these people around him, and it was like the Red Sea parted and he gave her a big hug,” Plotkin said. “She was the ultimate rock queen.”A few feet away, Margaret Lusterman, 61, a retired federal worker, said the photos made her contemplate the anguish she imagines Pang suffered when Lennon went back to Ono. “To be dumped by a lover and it was so public — that must have been so hurtful,” Lusterman said. “It’s not like she got any alimony.”In July 1983, when she was 32, Pang landed on the cover of Us magazine, smiling alongside a headline that promised her “exclusive” account of “life as John’s live-in lover — 18 months of manic music, suicidal binges, murder attempts, mind control and sex.”Pang’s memoir led to appearances on the talk show circuit, where her inquisitors included Joan Rivers and Maury Povich. Geraldo Rivera referred to Pang as Lennon’s “mistress” and asked her about reports that the Beatle was gay.“To me, he was a great lover,” she replied.As for whether Lennon had been physically abusive, as she reported in her memoir, Pang told Rivera, “He threw me against the wall” (she also wrote that Lennon, after he thought that she tried to stop him from taking a drink, “put his hands to my throat and began to strangle me,” an anecdote she now says was “exaggerated” by her co-author).Her relationship with Lennon began when Ono decided she and her husband needed a break from their marriage and asked Pang to become Lennon’s companion. Pang rejected Ono’s invitation before eventually warming up to Lennon when he, as she says, “charmed the pants off me.”One night during his separation from Ono, Lennon was ejected from Los Angeles’s Troubadour nightclub for heckling the Smothers Brothers, a well-publicized incident that fed speculation he had lost control. There were happier moments, too, including visits Pang helped arrange with his son, Julian, from whom he was distant. And there were extraterrestrial moments, such as when Lennon and Pang, both naked on their terrace, said they saw a UFO flying over Manhattan (“On the 23rd Aug. 1974 at 9 o’clock I saw a U.F.O. — J.L.” appears in the liner notes of his “Walls and Bridges” album.)Ono remained in constant contact, calling Lennon and Pang numerous times daily, and telling Pang at one point that Lennon should return to her. Not long after, Pang tearfully recalled in the documentary, Lennon announced that “Yoko has allowed me to come home.” Only days before, Pang said, she and Lennon had been making plans to buy a house in Montauk, N.Y., and fly to New Orleans to visit McCartney. Suddenly, he was back with Ono.The question of Pang’s significance in Lennon’s life is fodder for that most studious of rock subcultures, Beatle-ologists. Larry Kane, a journalist who wrote three Beatles books, said Lennon told him at one point that he was “deeply in love with someone and that person worked for them” though “he never said her name.”For all of the photographs of them together in public, Lennon rarely, if ever, spoke at length about Pang during interviews, though he identified her as “production coordinator” on his solo albums, as well as “Mother Superior” in the credits on his 1975 “Rock ’n’ Roll” album.“It’s hard to say it’s a good time, a fun time, a productive time when you’re sitting next to your wife,” Pang said, explaining why Lennon may not have mentioned her during the joint Playboy interview he and Ono gave when he spoke of his “lost weekend.”Elliot Mintz, Ono’s longtime spokesperson, declined to comment.Tim Riley, author of an acclaimed Lennon biography, said it’s not surprising he returned to Ono, “his artistic partner. He never had that with May Pang or anyone else.”“I don’t think it was a serious relationship on his part,” Riley said. “The power differential was considerable. He wasn’t running away with May Pang. He was having a vacation from his marriage that was authorized.”After Lennon left, Pang said they remained in contact, sometimes meeting up secretly. Nine years after Lennon’s death, she married record producer Tony Visconti and had two children before they divorced in 2000. Her thoughts, it seems, never stray far from Lennon. She still has mementos from their time together, including a drawing he made of her in which she is tall enough to reach the clouds. She also has the mattress they slept on (it’s in storage). When she sees a reminder of him, like the decorative “Lennon” license plate she spotted one day on a passing truck, she said she thinks “he’s watching over me.”“I have no closure with him,” Pang said. “How can I have closure when he says, ‘I have to find a way for us to be together’ and then he’s killed?”At the gallery in Alexandria, Pang offered to answer anyone’s questions.No, she said when asked about her relationship with Ono, she has not spoken to Lennon’s widow in years. Yes, she said, Lennon and McCartney could very well have written more songs together.As for a query about the complexities of her relationships with Lennon and Ono, Pang said, “You’ll have to see the movie.”The next day, she was back signing more prints and posters while a trailer for the documentary played in a corner on an unceasing loop.“My name is May Pang,” the audio repeated all day, “and this is my story.”A woman who drove from Charlottesville thanked her for helping Lennon spend time with Julian. A Smithsonian research fellow said he was “gobsmacked” to meet her.A mother and daughter slid into the chairs across from her. Now it was Pang who had a question.“How old are you?” she asked the daughter.Twenty-four.“All this happened by the time I was 24,” Pang said. “I grew up faster than I wanted to. Enjoy yourself.”Then she uncapped her pen and signed another poster."

Need some motivation to start your day? Reminisce about 1982, when “Eye of the Tiger,” the theme song for “Rocky III,” topped the music charts. Send tips to earlytips@washpost.com. Thanks for waking up with us.In today’s edition … Harris campaign outlines path to victory … How Biden found himself at a loss for the words that so often served him … but first …Scores of Democrats won’t be in attendance today when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers an address before a joint meeting of Congress, in a visit that has been rife with political maneuvering and partisan opposition.The politics will be quite literally front and center for Netanyahu. He arrives in the United States during a hotly contested campaign just more than three months before Election Day as the Democratic Party is undergoing a major transition. (Netanyahu and his far-right governing coalition are facing their own political strife at home.)Many Democrats from across the political spectrum are expected to skip the speech and have charged Republicans with using Netanyahu as a prop for political purposes. They say the prime minister’s address to Congress is unproductive, given strained U.S.-Israeli relations as Netanyahu has publicly defied U.S. advice and overtures to bring the 10-month war in Gaza to an end and allow humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave.Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the speech “political theater” during a Washington Post Live interview yesterday with Leigh Ann.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said “it will be the first time in American history that a war criminal” has been given the “honor” of addressing Congress. The International Criminal Court charged Netanyahu with war crimes.Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a leading Democrat who has been critical of Israel’s handling of the war, won’t attend the speech. He said on the Senate floor that Netanyahu and his far-right government have done “enormous damage” to Netanyahu’s relationship with the United States and the world and that it “sends a terrible message” to welcome him to the Congress.Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) has declined to preside over the joint address and won’t attend, either.Disgruntled Democrats want Netanyahu to commit to a cease-fire, relay a plan for long-term peace and commit to a plan for Gazans to receive abundant humanitarian aid. They have little confidence he will do that today.House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) isn’t tracking Democratic member attendance and is advising that it’s the members’ prerogative to attend or not.Many Democrats are boycotting, but others say they’re not changing their plans to be able to attend, such as Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).Still, others are planning to walk out mid-speech. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has said he will have any disrupters arrested.Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) said she was giving her ticket to family members of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Her office did not respond to questions about which family she gave her ticket.Some Democrats, such as Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), are attending reluctantly “out of respect for the State of Israel.”There will be some Democrats in attendance. Usually lawmakers don’t put out news releases announcing whether they plan to attend. With Netanyahu, they are. Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) said it is the responsibility of the United States — Democrats and Republicans — to show support for Israel.Even the process of inviting Netanyahu was fraught. A joint address to Congress is usually agreed to by the four congressional leaders. Johnson, sensing an opening and division within the Democratic Party, publicly floated the idea to pressure Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who had given a blistering critique of Netanyahu on the Senate floor, calling for new elections to replace him.Twelve-foot black fencing has been erected around the Capitol for security as U.S. Capitol Police expect “many thousands” of protesters today. Capitol Police arrested dozens of Jewish protesters yesterday in the Cannon House Office Building who said they were “horrified and dismayed” at Netanyahu’s invitation to Congress.Activists will be joined by some Democratic lawmakers including Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Greg Casar (D-Tex.), in a counterprogramming news conference to challenge Netanyahu’s narrative and urge the Biden administration stop sending offensive weapons to Israel.Vice President Harris, who is now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, will not be presiding over the speech. Instead, she is continuing with her preplanned trip to Indianapolis. Her aides insist it’s not a reflection of her position on Israel — but it is in line with broad thinking among Democrats who want to make a point by boycotting his address.And Harris skipping the speech has given fodder to Republicans, who have struggled to land on a cohesive attack against her.“Madam Vice President, you say you want to be the leader of the free world and yet you can’t bring yourself to sit behind are our most important strategic ally in this moment,” Johnson told reporters yesterday. “That is not a good look for you. It’s not a good look for America. It’s not a good look for her party that she aims to lead.”But it could be good politics for Harris. As we reported yesterday, frustrated Democrats who voted uncommitted in the primary because of President Biden’s public commitment to Israel have more hope with Harris.She “has pushed the rest of the Biden administration to more heavily consider Palestinian suffering in its response to Israel’s war in Gaza, lambasting the civilian death toll, calling on Israel to allow more aid into the territory and speaking more forcefully and empathetically than President Biden about the Palestinian plight,” our colleagues Yasmeen Abutaleb and Shane Harris report.“Harris’s aides and allies stress she believes deeply in Israel’s right to defend itself, noting she addresses it in every speech and that she has carried out the president’s foreign policy. But in several internal meetings and even in public remarks, Harris has raised the Palestinian viewpoint when she felt it was not being adequately considered in discussions and policymaking, multiple current and former White House officials told The Washington Post,” Yasmeen and Shane write.She and Biden will separately meet with Netanyahu tomorrow.Harris is expected to tell the Israeli prime minister that it is time for the war to end in a way that keeps Israelis safe, that all hostages should be released and that the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza needs to end, according to an aide for the vice president. They will also discuss efforts to reach a cease-fire.A huge thanks to Liz Goodwin for help reporting this story.Harris’s campaign is out with a four-page memo this morning outlining how she could win the presidential race, which takes place just over 100 days from now.It argues she can make voter gains beyond what Biden achieved in 2020, particularly by appealing to undecided minority and young voters, and it touts her particular edge on the issue of reproductive rights. It also points to the ground operation she is inheriting from Biden and the massive sums of money she has raised in the past 36 hours.“This campaign will be close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win,” wrote Jen O’Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair.The memo outlines their path to 270 electoral votes, vowing to still focus on the “blue wall” of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. It also argues that Harris could do particularly well in the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada — states where Biden had seen declining support.“We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,” O’Malley Dillon wrote.Now that Harris is the Democratic Party’s likely nominee, weeks of penned up panic among allied groups has given way to a historic flood of campaign cash, The Post’s Michael Scherer, Gerrit De Vynck and Maeve Reston report.The coordinated Harris campaign reported yesterday that they had raised more than $100 million from 1.1 million donors in the first 41 hours after Biden announced he was stepping aside.“Some of the funds had been withheld during the weeks of concern over Biden’s path to victory after his stumbling, confused performance at a June 27 debate prompted calls to drop out,” our colleagues write. “But major donors and fundraisers reported a newfound energy, both in donations to political groups that report their donations and to nonprofits that do not, which are funding much of the organizing effort in key states that will benefit the Democratic candidacy.”“A lot of people including myself, we were paralyzed in the last few weeks. A lot of us were not giving money to anything. Now we are seeing the floodgates have opened,” said Ning Mosberger-Tang, a major donor and former executive at Google, who announced plans to host a new fundraiser for Harris in coming weeks.President Biden will deliver a speech tonight from the Oval Office on his decision to end his reelection bid. Biden released a letter Sunday announcing his decision and shortly after endorsed Vice President Harris.Biden has been recovering from the coronavirus but returned to the White House yesterday. On Monday, he called in to the campaign headquarters during a visit by Harris and said, “You got this.”House Republican leadership is likely to determine today whether the chamber adjourns this week and leaves town to officially kick off campaign season and begin August recess. Republicans pledged to pass all 12 yearly funding bills when they gained the majority, but their intraparty differences have plagued their ability to meet that goal for two years in a row.Republicans last night ran into trouble passing the Energy and Water funding bill for fiscal year 2025, pulling it before it would have failed on the floor. If Republicans cannot reach a compromise on that and the Interior Department funding bill today, it’s possible the House leaves Washington for summer break as early as this evening.Biden has long viewed himself as an orator and yet has always had a complicated relationship with words, writes our colleague Matt Viser, in this look at how public speaking has long been an organizing element of Biden’s life — and recently led to the end of his reelection bid.As a child, Biden overcame a stutter by reading Irish poets and practicing conversations ahead of time. He made so much progress that by the time he became a senator, he was praised by colleagues for his rhetorical flourishes.But during his first presidential campaign, he was accused of stealing someone else’s words and using them as his own. And during his presidency, his aides have tried to ensure he sticks with prepared text rather than veering into the gaffes he has become known for.“They cut off questions from reporters and try to game out ahead of time what questions might be asked,” Matt writes. “More recently, in a physical manifestation of the type of accommodation they have made for an aging president, they added teleprompters even to his most intimate events, where he speaks to a group of 30 donors in a living room.”And then, last month, Biden’s bid for reelection was derailed by his inability to find the right words during a disastrous 90-minute debate.“The man who long prided himself on carefully crafting his words — who has given eulogies and commencement addresses, spoken at political rallies and delivered more Senate floor speeches than anyone could reasonably count — struggled to find the ones he needed, and that failure cost him the right to fight for the job he had long coveted and finally achieved,” Matt writes.Leigh Ann spoke with Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, about the following: Netanyahu’s address; Biden’s decision to step aside; why he called for Biden not to run and enthusiasm around Harris’s candidacy; and why he thinks Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) would be the running mate that would provide “the best chance to win.”Must reads from The Post:7 options for Harris’s VP pick, broken down.

WaPo_64,How Skibidi Toilet became one of the most valuable franchises in Hollywood,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/skibidi-toilet-movie-tv-franchise-youtube-michael-bay/,2024-07-25 05:58:02.609200,,"LOS ANGELES — While big budget movies vie for the top spot at the box office this summer, billions of people are clamoring to watch a YouTube show about toilets with human heads that is fast becoming one of the most valuable franchises in Hollywood.Alexey Gerasimov, the creator behind “Skibidi Toilet,” is working with leading independent Hollywood entertainment studio, Invisible Narratives, to expand the YouTube Shorts series into myriad product lines and a potential television and movie franchise similar to the Marvel universe or Transformers, executives involved with the project told The Washington Post.“I’ve always been a director that believes in taking risks,” filmmaker Michael Bay, who is working on the project with Invisible Narratives as chief creative adviser, told The Post. “Audiences yearn for fresh, new ideas. With Skibidi, it’s a new world of what the younger generation is watching, and I’m taking it very seriously.”“Skibidi Toilet” is the first narrative series to be told entirely through short-form video and has already amassed over 65 billion views on YouTube last year alone, becoming among the most viewed content on the platform. It tells the story of toilets with human heads engaged in a war with people who have CCTV cameras, speakers and televisions for heads amid a dark and dystopian landscape. They battle each other across an expanding industrial world, with Skibidi Toilets acting on behest of their leader, G-Man, to destroy humanity and transform more npeople into Skibidi Toilets.If Skibidi Toilet continues its current growth trajectory, executives say it could provide a new business model for Hollywood, which is struggling to compete with social media platforms for attention and facing the threat of automation through new technologies like artificial intelligence. Unlike many in Hollywood, some entertainment executives say they see hope in the internet.“I don’t think that there’s ever been anything that we’ve been involved with that mirrors the growth of this,” said Adam Goodman, CEO and founder of Invisible Narratives and former president of Paramount Pictures, in an interview with The Post. Goodman has overseen films such as the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' reboot, “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol,” and shows including SpongeBob SquarePants. “I think YouTube is one of the greatest breeding grounds of new IP. It’s a business as significant financially as everything we’ve seen in the traditional entertainment business. It’s just a little different.”Skibidi Toilet initially came onto Invisible Narratives’ radar after Bay became enthralled with Gerasimov’s YouTube channel. When Skibidi Toilet took off on the platform last year, Invisible Narratives struck a deal to build out the business through licensing and partnerships.Skibidi Toilet is incredibly popular, especially with Gen Alpha, children born after the year 2010. Skibidi Toilet themed toys will soon hit the shelves of every major retailer, thanks to a deal the company struck with Bonkers Toys. The National Electrical Contractors Association has been contracted to produce a line of Skibidi Toilet drones and RV vehicles. And licensing agreements aimed at expanding the brand into products like Skibidi Toilet bedding, apparel, plush toys, and more have been inked, according to the company.“I’ve never seen a digital property that has generated this much interest,” said Will Hanisch, head of brand development at Invisible Narratives.“We have built a team of execs and creative people who have worked on some of the biggest Hollywood franchises in the world,” said Goodman. “All of us are taking [Skibidi Toilet] just as seriously and treating it with the same amount of reverence as any of the big, billion dollar franchises that we have been lucky enough to work with.”While Skibidi’s initial success was born out of an organic fandom on YouTube, Invisible Narratives has built a sprawling marketing engine around the franchise to constantly reach new audiences. The company partnered with popular video games including Minecraft to integrate Skibidi Toilet skins and characters into the game. And, some of the most popular games on Roblox, an online gaming platform, are Skibidi Toilet themed, earning a collective revenue of tens of millions of dollars a year. “Much of our audience has discovered Skibidi because they’re coming to us from YouTube,” Goodman said, “but a whole other massive audience is discovering Skibidi through Roblox.”At any given point in time there are somewhere between 80,000 to 225,000 concurrent users playing Skibidi Toilet themed games in Roblox, said Joseph Jurbala, a partner at Bloxology, a licensing agency that manages the Skibidi Toilet gaming business in partnership with Invisible Narratives. The two largest Skibidi Toilet games on Roblox average around 20 million monthly users.Invisible Narratives also allows dozens of YouTube channels to produce their own fan-driven Skibidi Toilet content. Unlike traditional entertainment companies, who exercise tightly controlled grip over their intellectual property online and usually crack down on unapproved usage, Invisible Narratives encourages fans to create their own Skibidi Toilet content in order to boost the brand.“We made a decision that’s counter to everything we know as traditional entertainment executives,” said Goodman. “I worked at Paramount at a time when Viacom was in a lawsuit with YouTube [over IP]. We’re doing the opposite … we made an early decision to say, these channels can be really additive in building out the popularity of this.”As the popularity of the franchise has risen, a film and TV show is also in the works.Goodman said that he and the team at Invisible Narratives view Gerasimov, also known as Boom, as a filmmaking prodigy and hope to develop his talent. “Michael Bay and Boom spend a lot of time together talking about process, collaboration, iteration, and we’re exposing Boom to some artists who have worked on some of the biggest franchises in the world,” he said.While some might be tempted to write off Skibidi Toilet as a viral meme or short lived phenomenon, Goodman says that he believes the series to have the potential to become the next major entertainment franchise.“My business partner is Michael Bay and I ran Paramount and DreamWorks,” Goodman said. “Years ago we bought the rights to the film franchise for Transformers, and everyone thought it was a dumb idea. They were like, ‘you can’t make a movie about a toy from the 80s, what’s next, a movie about LEGOS?’” The LEGO movies went on to gross more than a billion dollars collectively at the box office, while the collective Transformers movies grossed a total of over $3 billion.“When friends of mine first see this, they look at it and they kind of give me this look like, good luck, I hope this works for you,” said Goodman. “This is as real as any franchise that we’ve ever been involved with.”In an age where everything in Hollywood feels like a reboot or is centered on decades old IP, Skibidi Toilet feels fresh, online culture experts said.“It has spread nationally in schools and on playgrounds. Kids are showing up wearing Skibidi Toilet shirts,” said Ben De Almeida, a YouTuber with over 7.5 million subscribers. Matthew Patrick, former host of the Game Theorists YouTube channel, which analyzes games and online culture, called Skibidi Toilet an “epic action movie.”“It’s a series and a story, not just a meme or funny video people are sharing,” Sophie Browning, a 21-year-old content creator in Minnesota explained.Goodman said this has allowed young people to feel a sense of ownership over the franchise. “They get to create their own sense of nostalgia for it,” he said. “They’re not inheriting it from their grandparents, or being told, oh you’re going to love Twister because I saw it back in the 90s when I was in high school. They discovered [Skibidi Toilet], it’s theirs.”Goodman said that, at the end of the day, good entertainment is good entertainment. “It’s still storytelling. It’s still character development, it’s still jokes and action and drama and intrigue. It’s just a different delivery mechanism.”“There’s so much opportunity for people in Hollywood to jump into this space,” he added."
WaPo_65,"Sylvain Saudan, skier of ‘impossible’ mountain slopes, dies at 87",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/07/24/sylvain-saudan-skier-dies/,2024-07-25 05:46:02.609200,,"In September 1967, a skier looked down on a narrow chute of snow between the saw-toothed ridges of the Mount Blanc massif. No one before had dared to ski the Couloir Spencer, which sheared off at a 55-degree angle at some points on the French peak Aiguille de Blaitière.When word spread that a Swiss mountain guide had successfully made the run, skeptics demanded proof. The Couloir Spencer had been considered impossible to ski: too steep, too rocky, too perilous. The next morning, a small plane flew over the site.There, below, were the tracks made by Sylvain Saudan, who went on to become one of the ski world’s most celebrated extreme sportsmen over the next two decades. He hunted never-before-attempted ski routes — sometimes skimming over rockfalls — on ranges including the Himalayas and famous peaks such as Kilimanjaro.“Fear has no place,” said Mr. Saudan, who died July 14 at age 87. “If you are afraid, it’s over.”Mr. Saudan had once been the skiing equivalent of a big-wave surfer or free-solo climber in constantly seeking greater challenges and testing new methods. His conquests gave him the nickname “Skier of the Impossible” and led to innovations in ski equipment and techniques to handle gradients so steep that his back brushed against the mountainside.“There’s really only one way out: Don’t fall down,” he wrote in the 1970 book “Skieur de l’impossible,” co-authored by French journalist Paul Dreyfus.Mr. Saudan also helped show the possibilities for the sport away from established ski resorts, opening the way for the growing number of skiers hiking or traveling by helicopter to remote areas. (The type of free-mountain skiing that brought Mr. Saudan renown is now so popular that some of the places he first skied in the Alps are part of adventure ski tours.)Other people before Mr. Saudan had climbed remote sections of mountains and successfully skied down. Mr. Saudan brought the feats to wider attention with films, lectures and showmanship — always seeking to surpass his previous exploits.After he skied Couloir Spencer, Mr. Saudan tackled similar untested gorges across the Alps, including the west face of the 13,015-foot Eiger in Switzerland and a section of La Tournette, a 7,713-foot peak in France. He rarely wore a helmet and never carried emergency gear such as a rope, saying such precautions diminished the rush while coming down a mountain.“You become much more aware of the danger, the pressure increases enormously, much more adventure,” he said in an interview published by the ski site Powderguide.com.To cope with the pitch of the mountains, Mr. Saudan developed a style of leaning back on his skis to slow his speed while swiveling his ski tips in what he called “windscreen wiper turns.” He streamlined his ski boots to remove sections that could bump against the steep slopes, and he added ultra-strong bindings capable of handling high stresses without popping open.His choice of skis depended on the conditions. In hard-packed snow and ice, he favored skis nearly seven feet long and used oversize poles for stability. In deep powder snow, he developed short and wide metal skis that he believed were more responsive in turning.He often reminded interviewers that confidence and mental preparation were as crucial as the gear.“When you make a descent like that, you have to believe in your mind that you have already done it,” he once said. “Then, on the day you do it, it is only physically. It’s too late when you are stood on the top to ask, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing here?’”In the early 1970s, Mr. Saudan began testing himself on mountains outside Europe. He descended the southwest face of Alaska’s Denali (then widely known as Mount McKinley) in 1972 amid temperatures that dipped to minus-30. “When I put my ski boots on at the top, they felt like they were two sizes too small for me,” he recalled. “The clips were white from the cold. I was lucky they didn’t break.”On Denali, he skied from near its peak at 20,310 feet to about 6,000 feet over seven hours. Later that year, he skied down parts of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa at more than 19,300 feet.In 1979, he set off for Nepal in hopes of starting a ski run from above 8,000 meters, or nearly 26,247 feet. On the Dhaulagiri massif, his team reached 7,600 meters before their planned push toward the summit. A sudden storm closed in, he recounted. Winds ripped at their tents.During the night, a wall of snow and ice crashed into a tent occupied by the team doctor and a mountain guide. They were swept away to their death. When the winds eased, the four survivors began their descent. Then a sherpa, named Pemba, lost his grip on a rope in a fatal mistake. “He was caught by a gust of wind and blown off the mountain like a piece of paper,” Mr. Saudan told the Telegraph in 2016.After 36 hours, Mr. Saudan, his partner Marie-Josée Valençot and mountain guide Jean-Pierre Ollagnier staggered into their base camp. “It was my biggest disaster in the mountains,” Mr. Saudan said. “They can be a very dangerous place.”He returned to the Himalayas in 1982 to ski from the peak of Gasherbrum I, a nine-hour run to the base in Pakistan that was considered the first full ski descent from above 8,000 meters. His team took 10 days to hike to the mountain and 25 days to reach the top. Mr. Saudan planned the expedition as his last major challenge. “You do not want to risk your life every day,” he told the Associated Press.But, for his 50th birthday in 1986, he skied from the 3,776-meter (12,388-foot) summit of Japan’s Mount Fuji to its base. There was almost no snow in late September. Mr. Saudan skied over slick grasses, brush and rock screes.“If you can ski on stones,” he said, “you can ski on anything.”Sylvain Saudan was born on Sept. 23, 1936, in Lausanne, Switzerland, and was raised in the Alpine hamlet near the present-day ski center at Verbier. His father watched over cows and sheep in mountain pastures, and his mother tended to the home.At 15, Sylvain left school and took construction jobs — first as a laborer on a highway project and then driving trucks at a hydroelectric dam being built. He had skied since childhood, but his family could not afford the equipment for him to compete on the racing circuit.He received his qualifications as a mountain guide and ski instructor in 1961, finding jobs in New Zealand, Colorado and Glenshee in Scotland. He said the often rough conditions of the Glenshee slopes proved invaluable in helping him later in remote mountains.“The best way to learn to ski is when the snow is not so smooth every day,” he told the Telegraph.Mr. Saudan died of heart-related ailments at his home in Les Houches, France. Survivors include his partner, Valençot, who confirmed the death.After ending his extreme skiing adventures, Mr. Saudan worked as a guide for skiers on trips that included heli-skiing. In 2007, he and two clients were aboard a helicopter that crashed after its rotor clipped the ground while the pilot was landing in a Kashmir valley. No one was injured. “Not even our skis were broken,” he said.Mr. Saudan and the two clients skied until sunset and then camped in the open, finally reaching an Indian military outpost the following day. The helicopter pilot was rescued by the Indian air force. Mr. Saudan joked that his obituary was already being prepared.“I am one of the rare people,” he said, “who already knows what will be written about me after my death.”"
WaPo_66,Vance once advocated that children get votes that parents could cast,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/jd-vance-parents-kids-voting/,2024-07-25 05:26:02.609200,,"A year before J.D. Vance was elected to the Senate, he advocated for a novel way to enhance the political strength of families — by giving parents the ability to cast tens of millions of additional votes on behalf of their children.Vance, now the Republican nominee for vice president, in a 2021 speech called for encouraging Americans to have more babies and allowing them to more fully advocate for their children.“When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power,” he told the conservative Intercollegiate Studies Institute. “You should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic than people who don’t have kids. Let’s face the consequences and the reality. If you don’t have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn’t get nearly the same voice.”Such a voting system would almost surely face legal challenges, experts in election law said. It would also create logistical hurdles. Election officials would need to track which voters were eligible to cast multiple ballots and regularly update their voter rolls to account for moves, divorces and court decisions in child custody cases.Vance appears unlikely to push for the idea if he’s elected to the White House alongside GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Vance has not written legislation on the issue since he was elected to the Senate in 2022. Vance spokesman William Martin called his 2021 proposal “nothing more than a thought experiment on strengthening parents’ rights and not a concrete policy proposal.”Trump has spent years baselessly calling into doubt mail-in ballots and other parts of the country’s elections system. A Trump spokesman did not say whether he supported Vance’s idea of letting parents cast additional votes for their children.Vance, the best-selling author of the 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” made his 2021 remarks a few weeks after he launched his Senate bid. In his 35-minute speech, Vance argued the right had lost control of all the nation’s cultural institutions and needed to encourage families to have more children to avert a “civilizational crisis” and reinvigorate the economy. He criticized the media, including The Washington Post, and lauded Hungarian President Viktor Orban’s policy of giving newly married couples loans that are forgiven if they stay together and have children.Vance derided many Democratic leaders for not having children — including Vice President Harris, who has two stepchildren and is now the Democrats’ likely presidential nominee.“What is the one thing that unites every single one of them?” Vance said of Harris and three other Democratic leaders. “Not a single one of them has any children. Now why is that? Why have we let the Democrat Party become controlled by people who don’t have any children?”The next day, at another event, Vance said the left had built “an entire political movement that is explicitly anti-child and anti-family.”Harris spokesman Ammar Moussa accused Vance of engaging in “ugly, personal attacks.” “Unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance, Vice President Harris understands that every single American has a stake in this country’s future,” Moussa said. In response, Vance’s campaign released a statement from Vance’s aunt Lori Meibers that called criticism of him “disgusting.”The idea Vance floated was fleshed out this month in a law review article titled “Give Parents the Vote” by Northwestern University law professor Joshua Kleinfeld and Harvard law professor Stephen Sachs. Giving parents the chance to vote on behalf of their children would “profoundly alter the incentives of American parties and politicians,” they wrote.Vance has not reviewed the article, according to his campaign, and he has not publicly gone into the level of detail that the authors do.There are more than 70 million children in the United States, according to the Census Bureau, and they account for nearly a quarter of the population. They have major stakes in climate change, the size of the federal government’s debt and long-term policies, Kleinfeld and Sachs wrote. They wrote that allowing parents to vote for children has to be taken seriously even if it sounds like a “silly provocation” at first.Under their plan, single parents would get to cast ballots on behalf of their children. Two parents who had shared custody would each effectively cast half a vote for each child. That way, a child’s ballot would be cast even if the parents disagreed on whom to vote for. That part of the plan would complicate the work of election officials, who would be responsible for keeping track of the “fractional votes” cast on behalf of children.Kleinfeld and Sachs downplayed the potential for fraud, saying election officials could establish systems to identify suspicious activity like ones the Internal Revenue Service uses to find people who falsely claim dependents on their tax returns. In response to questions, Sachs in an email called the logistical considerations of their proposal “a hurdle, but not an insurmountable one.”Allowing parents to cast votes for children is in line with giving them the power to make educational and medical decisions on their behalf, the pair wrote in their law review article.Which party would benefit from allowing parents to vote on behalf of their children is unclear, they wrote.“As to policy, while both parties will surely assemble new coalitions around issues of interest to parents, it’s hard to know what those issues will be,” they wrote, predicting politicians would start to push for “more child tax credits, more focus on school quality, more emphasis on public safety, more environmental protection, and more concern with long-term financial risk.”In his 2021 speech, Vance didn’t delve into the details of his proposal, such as what to do when parents disagree on how to cast a child’s ballot or whether to allow someone to vote on behalf of orphans who are wards of the state. He also did not address whether noncitizens who are barred from voting would be allowed to cast ballots on behalf of their children who were born in the United States and have citizenship. (Vance recently signed on to legislation meant to prevent granting birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants who are in the county illegally.)Joshua Douglas, an election law professor at the University of Kentucky, said he was intrigued by allowing parents to vote for children but questioned whether it would pass muster in court.“My guess is that a court would more likely strike it down as violating the idea of equal representation because it’s one person getting more technical votes,” he said. “Even though they’re voting almost as a proxy for their children, they’re getting more votes than someone who doesn’t have kids.”Edward Foley, an election law professor at Ohio State University, agreed such a system would face a tough road in court.He expressed doubts about the merit of the proposal. Democracy is built on the idea that all voters get an equal say and are responsible for thinking about what’s best for the entire community, not just themselves, he said.“I applaud the idea of making sure that our political system is well designed to think about the interests of kids,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean giving extra votes to parents. It means everybody as a voter should be thinking about all the interests that are worthy of protection.”"
WaPo_67,U.S. men’s soccer team returns to Olympics with 3-0 loss to France,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2024/07/24/united-states-france-paris-olympics-mens-soccer/,2024-07-25 05:22:02.609200,,"MARSEILLE, France — The U.S. men’s soccer team returned to the Olympics after a 16-year hiatus Wednesday with the most daunting of tasks: an opening match against not just the host nation but one that churns out world-class players with care and proficiency.Into the second half, the Americans showed they were up to the enormous challenge at raucous Stade Vélodrome. But in the space of about 10 minutes, all their efforts crumbled. In that spell, three fabulous U.S. chances failed to hit the target, while the French scored in the 61st and 69th minutes. After adding a late goal, the blue-clad hosts claimed a 3-0 victory.The U.S. team will continue Group A play Saturday against New Zealand in Marseille before closing Tuesday against Guinea in Saint-Etienne. New Zealand won its opener, 2-1 over Guinea in Nice.Olympic men’s soccer for the men is nothing like the World Cup. Aside from fielding just 16 teams — the 2026 World Cup will have a record 48 — the Olympic competition restricts rosters to players age 23 and under, with three allowances for three over-aged players.FIFA, soccer’s governing body, arranged it this way to prevent the Olympics from stealing even a sliver of limelight from its own quadrennial spectacle, the World Cup. (The women’s tournament has no age restrictions, though that could change someday as the women’s game grows.)Furthermore, FIFA does not require clubs to release players to the Olympics, leaving many young stars — and many over-aged candidates, such as France’s Kylian Mbappe — on the sidelines.Instituted in 1992, the age restriction has led to many unpredictable men’s results. Mexico won gold in 2012, and the United States was a semifinalist in 2000.The United States ended its maddening Olympic drought by roaring through qualification two years ago at an under-20 tournament. Serbian-born Marko Mitrovic took the reins of the Olympic squad last year. His three over-aged selections were center backs Walker Zimmerman, a World Cup starter from Nashville SC; Miles Robinson, from FC Cincinnati; and Colorado Rapids midfielder Djordje Mihailovic.Four other starters came from MLS teams, including Columbus Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte and Orlando City striker Duncan McGuire. His European-based starters featured Wolfsburg winger Kevin Paredes, from South Riding, Va., captain Tanner Tessmann and attackers Gianluca Busio and Paxten Aaronson.France’s most famous figure is its coach, former superstar Thierry Henry. None of his Olympians competed in the recently finished European Championship, but the roster included players such as forward Michael Olise, a recent Bayern Munich signing.On a hot, breezy day along the Mediterranean coast, a festive crowd began gathering outside France’s second-largest stadium (behind Stade de France) hours before kickoff — not with the pregame fervor of a match involving Les Bleus, as the national team is known, but one hungry for an Olympic medal.For all its World Cup success and bounty of top-shelf players, France has not won Olympic gold since 1984 and failed to qualify between 2000 and 2016. In 2021, it fizzled in the group stage.Aside from seeking a medal, the U.S. team is aiming to improve the reputation of the program at large after the senior team crashed out of Copa América in the group stage this summer — a shortfall that cost Gregg Berhalter his job as coach. On paper, the young Americans should finish in the top two of the group and advance to the quarterfinals.Against a technically superior foe Wednesday, they absorbed pressure and defended with conviction through the first half. They ventured into the attack when opportunity presented itself — which is to say, not often. In the 38th minute, though, Aaronson forced Guillaume Restes to make a kick save on a 16-yard bid, the top threat by either side in the half.The second half remained on script, with France setting the terms and the United States patiently waiting for a chance. It came in the 59th minute, when Mihailovic smashed a 25-yard shot off the crossbar.Two minutes later, France went ahead. Captain Alexandre Lacazette was allowed too much space beyond the penalty area. Busio was late trying to close him down. Lacazette pumped a low, 25-yarder that skimmed past the slow-reacting Schulte and into the far corner. Bedlam ensued.In rapid succession, the United States had two great chances, both set up by Paredes’s crossing, but Restes made a sensational save on Aaronson’s close-range header and John Tolkin’s header hit the left post from point-blank range.The French made the Americans pay in the 69th minute. Aaronson failed to close down Olise, who dropped a 20-yarder beyond Schulte’s reach and into the far side.In the 85th minute, Loïc Badé headed in Joris Chotard’s corner kick to complete the convincing victory."
WaPo_68,What to know about the NBA and WNBA’s massive new TV and streaming deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/nba-wnba-nbc-amazon-espn-rights/,2024-07-25 05:23:02.609200,,"The NBA and WNBA on Wednesday announced a slew of media rights deals worth around $76 billion over 11 years that will keep the NBA Finals on ESPN and ABC, while adding new partners in Amazon and NBC.But there could be complications. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns longtime NBA partner TNT Sports, informed the league this week that it has exercised what it believes to be matching rights for the Amazon deal. The league rejected that match and a legal fight could be ahead. Still, the league is pushing ahead full-steam.The agreements, which are set to begin after next season, amount to an incredible windfall for the leagues and are expected to lead to the first $100-million players in American sports. Here’s everything you need to know.Disney-owned ESPN and ABC will continue to broadcast the largest NBA package of games, including the NBA Finals and one conference finals most years. More than 20 regular season games will appear on ABC — usually on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons — and ESPN and ABC will broadcast all five Christmas Day games.But the league will have two new partners: Amazon and NBC, which will alternate broadcasting the other conference finals each year. During the regular season, Peacock will exclusively broadcast games on Monday night, and Amazon will broadcast games on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. NBC will also air the All-Star Game and dozens more games on Sunday and Tuesday nights. Amazon, meantime, will air at least one game on Black Friday, and the NBA’s in-season tournament. Prime Video will also distribute the play-in tournament games in the postseason.NBC will be an NBA partner for the first time since it aired games throughout the 1990s, when its theme song, “Round Ball Rock,” and Michael Jordan’s heyday were part of a golden age for the league. Amazon continues its push into live sports to help its burgeoning ads business after inking Thursday Night Football two years ago.As for fans, they will now need a cable package and subscriptions to ESPN Plus, Peacock and Amazon Prime to watch NBA games.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The WNBA, on the heels of the league’s exploding popularity and TV ratings, is set to receive $2.2 billion over 11 years, according to a person familiar with the figures. The NBA negotiated this deal on behalf of both the WNBA and NBA. The amount represents a substantial increase from the current media deals for the league, which are valued at around $60 million and will help the league increase player salaries and put the league and its teams on better financial footing.There are two additional WNBA packages, currently on ION and CBS, that will be negotiated later this year and are expected to raise the total value of the WNBA’s broadcast rights.The WNBA Finals will rotate between NBC networks, ESPN/ABC and Amazon. The deal calls for at least 25 regular season games on Disney platforms each season, at least 50 on NBC platforms and at least 30 on Prime Video.Big bucks. Disney is paying nearly double the amount of its previous deal, up to $2.6 billion per year from $1.4 billion in its current deal. NBC will pay $2.5 billion and Amazon around $1.8 billion each year. The staggering amounts are far above the national TV deals for Major League Baseball ($1.9 billion per year) and the NHL ($625 million), though still behind the NFL., which nets over $10 billion per year.The NBA’s regular season TV ratings have declined by some 30 percent over the last 10 years, which caused some media prognosticators to question how much the NBA would be able to collect in its new deals. But those dips don’t look so bad compared to entertainment television. According to Sportico, the four broadcast networks lost 80 percent of their prime-time viewers in the 18-49 age demographic over the same time period.In a continually fragmenting media landscape, the NBA is leaning heavily on broadcast TV, with NBC and ABC, and streaming, while moving away from cable. The league took advantage of traditional media companies that are squeezing what they can out of the old models of distribution and streaming platforms that want to use live sports to draw new subscribers.The Amazon piece of the deal isn’t buttoned up because TNT remains a wild card. TNT Sports believes it has the right to match Amazon’s portion of the deal and informed the NBA it was doing so this week. The NBA rejected TNT’s matching attempt, saying that TNT failed to explicitly match the terms of the deal.Warner can now mull its options, including suing the league. One thing is certain: There will be lawyers, and likely a lot of billable hours. “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it,"" TNT Sports wrote in a statement Wednesday, adding, ""We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-26 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action.”If Warner’s quest to hang on to the NBA is unsuccessful, it will save billions of dollars but will still need to find programming that ensures that cable providers still pay a premium price to carry TNT. The network has inked a number of smaller deals to broadcast the French Open and Big East basketball in coming years and has sub-licensed multiple College Football Playoff games from ESPN.Sir Charles is arguably the best known sports broadcaster in the country. He joined TNT after he retired and has been with the network for more than 20 years. If TNT’s legal challenges don’t net the network any NBA games, he will have one more season left on TNT’s pre- and postgame show, “Inside the NBA.” He has suggested he may retire after that, but he has threatened retirement before and will almost certainly get a few offers from the NBA’s remaining media partners."
WaPo_69,Conspiracy theories about Biden’s covid built on years of Trump rhetoric,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/24/biden-withdrawal-fueled-conspiracy-theories/,2024-07-25 06:32:02.641200,,"When President Biden announced he was suspending his campaign for president, Donald Trump and some of his supporters stitched together a series of conspiracy theories about Biden’s health, his motives for dropping out, and even whether he was still alive.Those false assertions built on years of reality-bending messages from Trump and others on the right that have helped polarize the electorate and shaken Americans’ belief in a shared set of facts. While political conspiracy theories have long been a feature of American life, today’s diffuse army of conspiracists are especially able to sow doubt, experts say, and are poised to undermine faith in the coming election less than four years after such false conspiracy theories fomented a violent attack on the Capitol.Hours after Biden said on Sunday that he was dropping out of the race, which came days after he received his covid diagnosis, Trump set the tone in a social media post. “Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No,” Trump wrote, challenging the announcement from Biden’s own physician describing his symptoms.In the same post, Trump claimed, without evidence, that Biden “had wanted to get out” of the presidential race since the night of the debate that sparked concerns nationally over the ability of Biden, 81, to serve a second term in the White House. (Biden acceded to calls that he resign from the race only after weeks of pressure from members of his own party.)“What happened to Joe Biden,” Trump adviser Chris LaCivita posted on X on Monday. “Where is he? We haven’t seen him since July 17th … around the time he ‘got covid’.”“When was the last time anyone saw Joe Biden?” asked Charlie Kirk, the founder and CEO of Talking Points USA, a youth-focused conservative advocacy group, who spoke at last week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.Trump and his allies provided no evidence for their conjecture, and the false assertions built up to the allegation advanced by some on the far right that Vice President Harris’s elevation to succeed Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate amounted to an illegal government takeover.“President Trump is merely asking relevant questions — something the media should do after they were exposed for helping Biden cover up his cognitive decline for the past four years,” said Steven Cheung, communications director for Trump’s campaign.Even before Biden announced he was suspending his campaign, Trump supporters predicted his covid diagnosis would keep him from running. Joey Mannarino, a self-described conservative populist with half a million followers on X, posted that Biden would get long covid, a condition he dismissed as fake, and quit the race. “Just wait,” he wrote.The day Biden released a letter announcing his decision to leave the race, Laura Loomer, a right-wing anti-Muslim activist with a history of publishing falsehoods, wrote to her more than a million followers on X  that she had heard from an unnamed source that Biden had not written the letter. Feminist author turned conspiracist Naomi Wolf reposted Loomer’s message. Another account, Slave to Christ, posted an image of Biden’s signature at the base of the letter, claiming that it did not match previous examples of his penmanship.Wolf in turn reposted the message, which spurred hedge fund manager Bill Ackman to chime in, questioning the authenticity of Biden’s signature to his 1.3 million X followers. The conspiracy theories persisted even after Biden called in to Harris’s televised appearance Monday at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Del., to rally staffers’ support for the vice president — his first public remarks since dropping out of the race.Kirk on Monday posted on X that he had had “a weird lead” on a story from a source close to the police department in Las Vegas, where Biden visited last week, that contradicted the “official story” that Biden had contracted covid. Kirk’s source, he said, indicated that the U.S. Secret Service had told the local police that an “emergency situation” involving Biden required a “medevac” to transport him to Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. “Apparently the rumor mill in the police department was that Joe Biden was dying or possibly already dead,” Kirk wrote to his more than 3 million followers. Kirk did not specify why his unnamed source asserted that Biden would travel to Johns Hopkins. He arrived later that evening at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.Kirk wrote that he had dismissed the tip at the time, but given that Biden had not been seen in public for several days, Kirk wrote that he was curious “if there is more to the official story than what they’re telling us.”Tucker Carlson read Kirk’s dispatch on his online show hosted on X, and several conservative outlets picked up the report.When asked about the reports, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department provided a statement that it “was notified that President Joe Biden was sick on July 17th during his visit to Las Vegas” but were not informed of the nature of his illness. “As a precaution, LVMPD proactively began to shut down roads” leading to the local hospital, before the Secret Service told the police that Biden was heading directly to the airport.“I think it’s clear that there was an undisclosed medical event on July 17th,” Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for Kirk, texted, citing the planned road closures and additional anonymous police sources from another journalist, but no medical evidence. After Kirk received a tip, he shared his information with his audience to try to get more detail, Kolvet added. “Joe Biden either recovered quickly, or they’re not telling us the entire story. It’s also very curious that he dropped out of the race only four days later. We still have a lot of questions, but we followed a lead and have confirmed much of the original story.”Heading into the last months of the 2024 presidential campaign, which has been upended by extraordinary events including an assassination attempt on Trump and Biden’s decision to step away from the race, researchers are girding for conspiracy theories to take root with every news event.“It’s a common tactic to take a shred of information that’s in the news and find a way to align it with an existing conspiratorial worldview, which in this case is that the Deep State and the current administration are out to get Trump,” said Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics at the Southern Poverty Law Center. She explained that conspiracy theories about Biden’s ill health serve to demonstrate that the federal government is dishonestly propping up a Trump adversary in order to undermine the former president. “Most of these theories are designed to position Trump as the hero of the story,” she added.Some figures on the right attempted to tie the attempted assassination to Biden’s stepping out of the race.“Biden didn’t drop out of the race until after the attempts to imprison and assassinate Donald Trump failed. Do you think that is coincidence?” Sean Davis, co-founder and CEO of the conservative Federalist site, said in a post shared on X.“All political conspiracy theories seem to eventually converge,” said Melissa Ryan, digital strategist at Card Strategies, where she specializes in studying online hate and conspiracy theories. She added that the close proximity in time between Trump’s shooting and Biden’s withdrawal made it easier for the conspiracy-minded to link the two events.But investigators have found no evidence connecting Biden or the Democratic Party to the gunman who attempted to kill Trump, nor have they identified a particular ideology or motive driving the shooter, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old killed at the scene. Crooks had searched online days earlier for information about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and he used a rifle with a collapsible stock that may have made it easier for him to disguise the weapon before climbing onto a roof, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.The current moment has brought conspiratorial thinking, which emerged on the fringes of politics during Trump’s first term, into the center of a major-party platform, experts said.“The issue isn’t so much the theories themselves,” said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami who specializes in conspiracy theories. “The issue is that you have Donald Trump and his allies in the conservative media and the government using a lot of conspiracy theories, and that’s where it becomes a major problem, because they have political elites like presidential candidates and senators and representatives and cable news channels and internet personalities with big audiences … pushing this stuff to audiences who trust them. [And] that’s really bad. And that’s where we need to be focused.”Before Harris addressed the nation Tuesday from a suburb of Milwaukee in her first rally, Worldnet Daily, the far-right conspiracy theory publication that was a leading voice falsely claiming that former president Barack Obama was not born in the U.S., recirculated online posts about Biden stepping away from the race and asked, “Did we just witness a coup?”The inability to agree on a set of facts leads to the perception of an information vacuum, said Squire, such that even with more information, the vacuum never fills up. “When you have a lack of information,” she said, “the world we’ve built is going to fill that with garbage.”Jeremy Merrill contributed research."
WaPo_70,The NBA and WNBA have a massive new TV and streaming deal,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/07/24/nba-wnba-nbc-amazon-espn-rights/,2024-07-25 06:00:02.641200,,"The NBA and WNBA on Wednesday announced a slew of media rights deals worth around $76 billion over 11 years that will keep the NBA Finals on ESPN and ABC, while adding new partners in Amazon and NBC.But there could be complications. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns longtime NBA partner TNT Sports, informed the league this week that it has exercised what it believes to be matching rights for the Amazon deal. The league rejected that match and a legal fight could be ahead. Still, the league is pushing ahead full-steam.The agreements, which are set to begin after next season, amount to an incredible windfall for the leagues and are expected to lead to the first $100-million players in American sports. Here’s everything you need to know.Disney-owned ESPN and ABC will continue to broadcast the largest NBA package of games, including the NBA Finals and one conference finals most years. More than 20 regular season games will appear on ABC — usually on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons — and ESPN and ABC will broadcast all five Christmas Day games.But the league will have two new partners: Amazon and NBC, which will alternate broadcasting the other conference finals each year. During the regular season, NBC’s Peacock platform will exclusively broadcast games on Monday night, while NBC will air the All-Star Game and dozens more games on Sunday and Tuesday nights. Amazon will broadcast games on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and will also air at least one game on Black Friday and the NBA’s in-season tournament. Amazon will also distribute the play-in tournament games in the postseason.NBC will be an NBA partner for the first time since it aired games throughout the 1990s, when its theme song, “Round Ball Rock,” and Michael Jordan’s heyday were part of a golden age for the league. Amazon continues its push into live sports to help its burgeoning ads business after inking Thursday Night Football two years ago.As for fans, they will now need a cable package and subscriptions to ESPN Plus, Peacock and Amazon Prime to watch NBA games.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.The WNBA, on the heels of the league’s exploding popularity and TV ratings, is set to receive $2.2 billion over 11 years, according to a person familiar with the figures. The NBA negotiated this deal on behalf of both the WNBA and NBA. The amount represents a substantial increase from the current media deals for the league, which are valued at around $60 million, and will help the league increase player salaries and put the league and its teams on better financial footing.There are two additional WNBA packages, currently on ION and CBS, that will be negotiated later this year and are expected to raise the total value of the WNBA’s broadcast rights.The WNBA Finals will rotate between NBC networks, ESPN/ABC and Amazon. The deal calls for at least 25 regular season games on Disney platforms each season, at least 50 on NBC platforms and at least 30 on Prime Video.Big bucks. Disney is paying nearly double the amount of its previous deal, up to $2.6 billion per year from $1.4 billion in its current deal. NBC will pay $2.5 billion and Amazon around $1.8 billion each year. The staggering amounts are far above the national TV deals for Major League Baseball ($1.9 billion per year) and the NHL ($625 million), though still behind the NFL., which nets over $10 billion per year.The NBA’s regular season TV ratings have declined by some 30 percent over the last 10 years, which caused some media prognosticators to question how much the NBA would be able to collect in its new deals. But those dips don’t look so bad compared to entertainment television. According to Sportico, the four broadcast networks lost 80 percent of their prime-time viewers in the 18-49 age demographic over the same time period.In a continually fragmenting media landscape, the NBA is leaning heavily on broadcast TV, with NBC and ABC, and streaming, while moving away from cable. The league took advantage of traditional media companies that are squeezing what they can out of the old models of distribution, and streaming platforms that want to use live sports to draw new subscribers.The Amazon piece of the deal isn’t buttoned up because TNT remains a wild card. TNT Sports believes it has the right to match Amazon’s portion of the deal and informed the NBA it was doing so this week. The NBA rejected TNT’s matching attempt, saying that TNT failed to explicitly match the terms of the deal.Warner can now mull its options, including suing the league. One thing is certain: There will be lawyers, and likely a lot of billable hours. “We have matched the Amazon offer, as we have a contractual right to do, and do not believe the NBA can reject it,” TNT Sports wrote in a statement Wednesday, adding, “We think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-26 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action.”If Warner’s quest to hang on to the NBA is unsuccessful, it will save billions of dollars but will still need to find programming that ensures that cable providers still pay a premium price to carry TNT. The network has inked a number of smaller deals to broadcast the French Open and Big East basketball in coming years and has sub-licensed multiple College Football Playoff games from ESPN.Sir Charles is arguably the best known sports broadcaster in the country. He joined TNT after he retired and has been with the network for more than 20 years. If TNT’s legal challenges don’t net the network any NBA games, he will have one more season left on TNT’s pre- and postgame show, “Inside the NBA.” He has suggested he may retire after that, but he has threatened retirement before and will almost certainly get a few offers from the NBA’s remaining media partners."
WaPo_71,"Trump rally shooter searched for info on JFK assassin, FBI chief says",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/07/24/wray-fbi-trump-shooting-testimony-capitol-hill/,2024-07-25 06:42:02.641200,,"The gunman who tried to assassinate former president Donald Trump had searched online days earlier for information about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and used a rifle with a collapsible stock that may have made it easier for him to disguise the weapon before climbing onto a roof, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said Wednesday.Wray’s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee offered the most detailed account to date of the actions of Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman who was fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper after opening fire during the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa. One rallygoer was killed, two others were critically injured, and Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear.The rally shooting, two days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, rattled elected officials across the country and raised new fears about political violence in a tumultuous presidential election year. Wray sought to reassure lawmakers that his agency was doing everything possible to understand the gunman’s actions, while also cautioning that other federal investigators would be responsible for assessing the security failure that made the attack possible.A week before the rally, Crooks searched for answers to “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,” Wray said — a reference to the assassin who used a rifle to kill President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963.“That’s a search that’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” the FBI director said during the hours-long hearing, which was dominated by questions about the attack on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “He was interested in public figures and — I think this is important — starting around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally.”That same day, Wray said, the gunman also registered to attend the outdoor rally.Crooks, who lived about an hour away in Bethel Park, Pa., fired at Trump from a rooftop just outside the rally security perimeter, using an AR-style rifle. FBI investigators have said so far that the gunman did not appear to have any discernible ideology, suggesting he was not motivated primarily by political animosity.Wray said the exact nature of Trump’s injury remains uncertain: “There’s some question about whether or not it’s a bullet or shrapnel that hit his ear.”“There’s a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do,” Wray said. “The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI’s investigation is very much ongoing.”“We’d love to have a road map that tells us exactly what he’s thinking,” the director continued. “We haven’t found that yet.”Wray, who was nominated to lead the FBI in 2017 by then-President Trump, avoided discussing the security shortcomings that preceded the attack, saying those issues are under review by an inspector general and an outside group of experts. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned Tuesday under pressure from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the lapses.Somewhat unusually for the House Judiciary Committee, Wednesday’s hearing included hours focused mostly on the facts and substance of the Trump assassination attempt, rather than the partisan finger-pointing that typically dominates such sessions.Still, there was some partisanship.Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the committee, is a longtime Trump ally and critic of Wray, the FBI and the Justice Department. He began the hearing by criticizing what he called “the Biden-Harris Justice Department” — an acknowledgment that Vice President Harris is now running for the Democratic nomination after President Biden announced he would not seek a second term.Before Wray finished testifying, Trump attacked him on social media, saying he should resign not because of anything to do with the shooting, but because the FBI director answered questions about his interactions with Biden by saying he observed nothing awry in the president’s cognitive abilities.“If that is the case, Director Wray should resign immediately from the FBI, and stop ‘sweet talking’ Congress every time he goes up, which he loves to do,” Trump posted.Wray told lawmakers that the rifle used in the rally shooting was bought legally in 2013 by the gunman’s father, who sold it to his son in October 2023. The FBI determined that the family had 14 guns, the director said.The weapon had a collapsible stock, meaning the gunman might have been able to hide it from view while carrying it before the attack. Wray noted that witnesses at the rally reported seeing a man with a gun on the rooftop, but not earlier, which might be explained by the collapsible stock.The FBI director also confirmed a number of details from the investigation that have been publicly reported, including that there were eight spent bullet casings found near the gunman’s body — indicating that he fired at least that many times.Before Crooks opened fire, a local police peered over the roof and saw the man in a prone position with a gun, Wray said. Crooks turned to look at the officer, who then ducked down.“That’s seconds before the event,” Wray said.The director also described how Crooks apparently used a drone hours before the shooting to examine the area near the rally, but not directly overhead.“The drone was recovered in his vehicle,” Wray testified. “The shooter was flying the drone around the area, not over the stage. … We think that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage for about 11 minutes, about 200 yards away.”Two explosive devices were found in the shooter’s car, items that Wray called “relatively crude devices themselves, but they did have the ability to be detonated remotely.”However, because the remotely controlled devices attached to the homemade bombs were left in the “off” position, Wray said, it appears “that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.”Technical experts at the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., were able to crack open the gunman’s phone within two days of the attack. While they found some evidence of interest, the device did not provide an explanation for his motive, people familiar with the investigation have said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the ongoing case.The gunman used some encrypted messaging applications, which Wray said have “unfortunately now become very commonplace” in FBI investigations, as popular messaging software often includes encryption.Asked whether the FBI believed there were any accomplices or co-conspirators in the shooting, Wray answered, “Not at this time, but again the investigation is ongoing.”"
WaPo_72,"Once homeless, these D.C. peer educators will go on to help pull others up",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/24/dc-homeless-peer-educators-housing/,2024-07-25 07:41:02.789816,,"Almost 10 years ago, Charlynn Green walked with her two children into a D.C. family homeless shelter, out of options and short on hope. She had been working minimum wage at a grocery store, triaging the last $20 of each paycheck — “trying to figure out if you want to put gas in the car or you want to eat” — when she lost housing, too.But on Wednesday, Green walked onto the stage of a Howard University auditorium in a graduation cap, and took the lectern to address the 34 other graduates of D.C.’s first peer case management program seated before her.“I’m nervous,” Green said.“It’s okay!” a few yelled.Like Green, the students had known homelessness. That was why they were here. In a first-of-its-kind program, the Howard School of Social Work’s Peer Case Management Institute is intended to prepare the graduates to bring their “lived experience” to work as case managers, helping to pull others out of homelessness by connecting them with the services they need. The program, administrators said, will expand D.C.’s capacity in the homeless services system — particularly at a time when homelessness is on the rise and D.C. is struggling with a shortage of social workers, hampering the city’s efforts to end chronic homelessness.“I just feel like, with my experience — I lived it — I can be a successful caseworker,” Green, 32, said in an interview, “because you got some people that’s caseworkers that never been through anything, and just don’t know how to navigate for that person or help them navigate. I feel like I’m that bridge to the community.”The D.C. Department of Human Services, which oversees many of the District’s homeless services, pitched the program for formerly homeless students to Howard University administrators with a double benefit, said DHS Director Laura Zeilinger: training more specially qualified case workers to join a stretched-thin workforce struggling to meet the demand for help — while also creating economic opportunity and career paths for dozens of formerly homeless residents. “This is something that was a natural coalescence of all those values,” she said.The caseworker shortage had been a serious hurdle for many of D.C.’s housing programs, which can be difficult to navigate without assistance. Historically, Zeilinger said, the problem was getting enough funding for housing subsidies — but after the D.C. Council funded hundreds of new vouchers in recent years, DHS struggled to scale up the programs to respond to the hundreds of new applicants.While housing officials have made improvements, at one point last year more than 3,000 vouchers were sitting unused, as applicants endured long delays or paperwork snags in the multistep process. Sometimes they turned to case workers for help but did not get it, and high turnover rates among case workers stymied housing aid recipients relying on them.D.C. officials tried to get creative with recruitment. In addition to the new Howard program, the D.C. Council passed legislation by council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) to create a free master’s in social work degree at the University of the District of Columbia.“We are eager to expand to meet the needs of people still experiencing homelessness — but we don’t have the workforce,” said Christy Respress, president and CEO of Pathways to Housing, which helped develop the Howard program. “We literally don’t have the capacity to serve more people.”But now she was looking at the graduates as potential hires, she said.Working with nonprofit the Community Partnership and Pathways to Housing, Howard professors created a seven-week program in the classroom, plus four weeks of training in the field. They got 600 applications and selected 40 for the inaugural class, with all but five completing the program.They focused on skills ranging from motivational interviewing to de-escalating conflict — and using lived experience not to tell people what to do but to connect with them, said Tracy Whitaker, associate dean of Howard’s School of Social Work.“What we talk about is where that lives in you, and where it comes out in your professional practice,” she said.Numerous graduates said their own experiences in homeless shelters or with inattentive social workers motivated them to pursue careers in the field.Teanna Anderson, 36, said she experienced a bout of homelessness two years ago and went to a pair of shelters. On one visit, she said, she overheard two employees passing judgment on the homeless woman who just left the cubicle, questioning how she afforded her clean new pair of Nikes and whether she really needed help.“And it just was like, this is how they see us. You know what I mean?” Anderson said.She was assigned a case worker — but the experience didn’t feel personal, she said.“Even if at that moment I have hit my rock bottom, I would like to see that someone who helps me understands me,” she said. “And I think having lived experience is so important … . Most people in social work have not ever been homeless — they don’t really know what it’s like. All of us have been homeless. All of us know what it’s like. And we also know the system and how it affects your mental health, trying to scratch the surface of where you need to get.”Sabrina Mathis, 30, said her family experienced homelessness in Maryland when she was in high school, but they didn’t have anyone to help them navigate into stability. “I wish it was someone like me,” she said.“Getting to know other homeless people, they really do want to change. They do want to get better,” she said. “It’s just they don’t know how, and it takes people like us to give them the how. … I’m glad that they gave us a chance so that we could give other people a chance as well.”In her journey out of homelessness, Green said she entered the District’s rapid rehousing program, a short-term housing subsidy, before getting a D.C. Housing Authority voucher, finally giving her stability to keep her housing.They are the same types of programs she will be helping her clients navigate, she said — work she has already begun after her training led to a job opportunity as a part-time case worker, in addition to a job at DHS. And as she walked behind the lectern to address her classmates, she reflected on how far her journey had taken her since she walked into the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center nine years ago.“Before being accepted into the program, I would often feel like a failure due to the trials I encountered in my life,” Green told her classmates, thinking of her children the most.The class, she said, “gave me my hope back. ”"

WaPo_74,"U.S. flag set ablaze, 23 arrested as thousands protest Netanyahu’s D.C. visit",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/07/24/dc-protest-netanyahu-visit-israel-gaza-war/,2024-07-25 07:47:02.789816,,"Thousands of Palestinian supporters and critics of the ongoing Israel-Gaza war descended on Washington on Wednesday in opposition to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before and during his address to a joint meeting of Congress, drawing a massive police response as they marched around the city.Though most demonstrators walked and chanted peacefully, there were some clashes with law enforcement, and D.C. and Capitol Police said they arrested 15 people in total. The U.S. Park Police arrested eight people.Outside Union Station, pro-Palestinian protesters set an American flag ablaze, along with an effigy of Netanyahu, and spray-painted the Christopher Columbus fountain and adjacent Liberty Bell reproduction with messages like “Free Gaza,” “All zionists are bastards,” and “Free Palestine.” Police appeared to hit some demonstrators with a chemical irritant at multiple points during the day.The protesters came, they said, to decry Netanyahu’s policies and condemn how Israel has prosecuted the war in Gaza. Although the demonstrators expressed a range of political beliefs about the conflict, they voiced a similar message: The human suffering from the war has continued far too long, and it is past time for Netanyahu to sign a cease-fire deal. Others demanded the release of hostages taken during Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack that precipitated the war and an end to U.S. aid to Israel.Protesters began gathering midmorning on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the Capitol holding signs calling for an end to U.S. aid to Israel and others with photos of Netanyahu under the word “WANTED.”Tables were set up nearby providing water as well as red shirts and kaffiyehs for protesters to wear. Hundreds of signs attached to wooden stakes were distributed to rallygoers. Small Palestinian flags had been attached to lampposts and street signs up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.In anticipation of the protests, bike racks and fencing were set up around the Capitol, and a Capitol Police spokesperson said the agency planned to add more officers, including from outside agencies. New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry posted on X that more than 200 officers from his agency would be assisting Capitol Police.Hasan Isham, 34, held his 3-month-old daughter, Amelia, as he gathered with other protesters. Amelia was dressed in a onesie covered in watermelons, a symbol for Palestinian liberation.“Little kids are being killed in Gaza,” Isham said. “Little kids like mine.”The resident of Silver Spring, Md., came to the protest because he “had to do something to register his anger,” especially because he felt his tax dollars were supporting the deaths.“Over the past 10 months, many Hasans have been killed in Gaza along with their entire family,” he said. “Every time I pick up my daughter, I can’t help but think: ‘That’s something that could happen to me. That’s happening to people who look like me.’”Sereen Haddad has lost more than 130 members of her family in Gaza since the onset of the war. Relatives have been displaced. Family members are living on the streets, searching for any shelter, including a cousin who gave birth to twins in November.These are the people Haddad, 19, was keeping in mind Wednesday.“Netanyahu has decided that he’s apparently welcome in D.C., and we’re making it clear to him that he’s not,” she said.Maryland residents David Reed, 76, and Mark Harrison, 73, listened to the speeches as the crowd around them grew. The longtime friends said they were outraged by Netanyahu’s presence in the city and U.S. support of Israel’s military incursion into Gaza, but heartened by the feeling that protest movements were making a difference.“The movement is now beginning to influence formal U.S. policy,” said Reed, “[evidenced] by the boycott of many congressional leaders from [Netanyahu’s] speech.”“I wouldn’t be out here if I didn’t think I was making a difference,” Harrison added.The largest demonstration Wednesday was organized by several groups, including the ANSWER Coalition, the Palestinian Youth Movement, the People’s Forum and the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network.Additional protests against Netanyahu’s handling of the war included demonstrators blocking traffic downtown.At noon, close to 100 people rallied in a park near Union Station. Some waved Israeli flags, and others stood behind a banner that read “Save Israel from Bibi,” using Netanyahu’s nickname. The gathering was organized by UnXeptable, an activist group of Israeli expatriates, and speakers, including Rabbi Jill Jacobs, who urged political leaders to save the hostages but also to “save Israel and its democracy.”“We’re here today to say we refuse to let a small number of zealots, including Benjamin Netanyahu, destroy the state of Israel,” Jacobs said to the crowd. “We’re here to tell Netanyahu that he and his fascist politics are not welcome here in the United States or in Israel.” Participants punctuated the remarks with chants of “Shame, shame, shame” and “Seal the deal” to bring hostages home.Pro-Palestinian protesters rallying on the National Mall demanded Netanyahu be arrested as a “war criminal,” citing the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor’s announcement in May that he was seeking to charge Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar with war crimes and crimes against humanity.A little before noon, a few dozen protesters blocked traffic at 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW, hoping to disrupt Netanyahu’s motorcade route. As cars stuck on Independence honked, the protesters chanted: “Not another nickel, not another dime. No more money for Israel’s crimes.”Two black SUVs flashing police lights tried to pass, but protesters did not move and the vehicles were driven away. Protesters held up a large papier-mâché depiction of Netanyahu wearing handcuffs.“So long as this genocide happens, we the people are going to take things into our hands,” said Reem Assil, an organizer who traveled to the protests from Oakland, Calif., and was part of the group blocking traffic.Assil said she has family in Gaza, where more than 40 of her relatives have died since the start of the war.Closer to the Capitol, a bagpiper in a green plaid kilt played “Amazing Grace” as he marched from Union Station among about 100 demonstrators. The group applauded at his finish, before he joined the crowd to shout “Free, free Palestine!”Later in the afternoon, as Netanyahu prepared to give his speech to Congress, thousands of protesters marched up Constitution Avenue toward the Capitol. Near the intersection with Louisiana Avenue, they approached a line of Capitol Police officers who ordered them to stop and move back. As the marchers continued to press forward, police officers sprayed the protesters with pepper spray.Capitol Police posted on X that some protesters  “started to become violent” and did not “obey our order to move back from our police line.”“We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,” police said in the post.Capitol Police arrested six people for unlawful conduct in the House galleries, said agency spokeswoman Brianna Burch. Earlier in the day, D.C. police arrested five people on Independence Avenue and Fourth Street SW on charges of crowding, obstructing or incommoding in a public place, according to Paris Lewbel, the department’s deputy communications director.At Union Station around 3 p.m., demonstrators replaced the American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of the fountain with red spray paint and wrote “Hamas is comin” in big letters. D.C. police made four arrests at Columbus Circle on charges of assaulting a police officer, a spokesperson said, bringing the department’s total number of arrests in the Wednesday demonstration to nine.The U.S. Park Police on Wednesday arrested eight people at Columbus Circle, according to spokesman Thomas Twiname. He said officers made the arrests after demonstrators “damaged and destroyed park property, including vandalizing statues and fountains, tearing down and burning flags, and starting several small fires.”But by late afternoon the demonstration began to come to a close and protesters started making their way home. For many in the crowd — made up of different races and religions and spanning generations — the day of protest was one of kinship they hoped would send a message to U.S. leaders.“It’s a pretty good feeling that there are so many people here … irrespective of cause, race, creed, gender or religion, and they’re just here as human beings,” said Kaneez Fizza, 34, who moved to Maryland two years ago from India. She came to the protest with her husband and 2-month-old son. “I feel very hopeful looking at the crowd because we are not looking at this as just a Muslim or Arab issue anymore. We are looking at it as a humanitarian crisis.”A caption for a photo that was included in an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a group of Orthodox Jewish protesters. Their group is Neturei Karta. In addition, a previous version of this article misspelled the first name of organizer Reem Assil. The article has been corrected. "
